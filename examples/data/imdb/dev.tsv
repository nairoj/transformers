Any movie that portrays the hard - working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored , cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era.It 's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman .	0
"It 's 1978 , and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well ! Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full , only less happy there are so many black players on the field ! This made for TV Super Bowl movie is watchable . It 's not much more , but it 's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance ( for the time ) , probably most notably Tom Selleck . Unfortunately any goodness Selleck brings to the screen , is quickly trumped by "" actors "" like Dick Butkus.It 's a silly story about super bowl betting . PJ Jackson is charged by "" New York "" ( read mafia ) for ensuring the game ends for their favor , in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet . PJ is innocent enough , and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there . But things seem to fall apart for him . Another person , the unsuspected Lainie , takes charge . For a while , the mystery of murders is n't known for certain , but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist.It 's a bad movie , but is watchable . The acting is decent , and the filming is OK . At least there were n't any silly typical 70s car chases ( they have their place just not here ) . Just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you 'll survive.2/10 ( maybe a 2.5 )"	0
"The pilot of Enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original Star Trek : A dose of realistic , flawed personalities . The Utopian characters of the Next Generation got tiring , they were so noble as to be unbelievable . I also like the sub - plot that humans are bitter toward the Vulcans . Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs . It makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two , though I do n't think it would work in the time frame of the show . The only negatives that jumped out at me were the "" quick cut off the ending at 2 hours "" feel of the end , which is common among many of the Trek shows . The second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes . It was out of place , a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre - teen audience with some skin . But its not my job to make the show profitable , so oh well.Lets see how the next episode does ."	1
"I admit , I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening , and everyone has already described the "" plot . "" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it 's impaled on the grass in the front yard ! I 'm guessing the bratty kid did it , put it 's never explained .

"Seriously , can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget : Daniel Day - Lewis , Ray McAnally , Brenda Fricker , Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw ? There 's no doubting that Fricker and Day - Lewis deserved their awards : but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor ( as Young Christie ) and McAnally awarded : the cliché is true here : they do n't perform the roles , they inhabit them . Day - Lewis ' performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe - inducing , but it was truly a mark of the Academy 's intelligence that alongside this performance , they also honoured Brenda Fricker 's beautifully restrained , still and heart - wrenching work as Christie 's mother . By the way , if you have n't seen this magnificent actress in "" Swann "" , that 's another film well worth checking out for her contribution ( and the sublime Miranda Richardson ) ."	1

"So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded . Here are some remarks .. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed . She also looks very old and I do n't think this is achieved with much make - up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema - goers . I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . Mamie Gummer 's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . She is surprisingly good ; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . I agree with a previous comment : Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films ( "" Nell "" for example . ) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . Their interplay is weak . Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character . Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time . Streep 's performance actually is little more than a cameo . Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit , especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave 's character . As for the men ; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people ( one of them a man ) are so much smitten by this man . The backstory to this should have been developed more.The cinematography is excellent as expected . However the main summer house set failed to convince me . It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill , particularly with its grass patch in the front . A bit too cardboard like.Overall , the film is a classy production , but a seen - it - all - before , cried - at - it - all - before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker . However , it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time , about one 's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . Worth trying at least on DVD if not at the movies ..."	1
I like British humor , I believe it 's one of the best in the world . I like almost every British sitcom ( okay ... maybe not Monthy Python , some of the jokes were great , but some of them I did n't understand . ) , but this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick . This show was good in some way ; it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel I 'm not hungry anymore . This is really just disgusting , sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff . I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off . It was so disgusting , watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what 's so funny about that ? ? ? It makes me wanna puke . No humor , just disturbing images and cheap , toilet laughs ... I do n't know ... if you like this stuff ... you go ahead ... watch it ... but to be honest , people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems . Garbage .	0
"I recently watched this , but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about , what the topic was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was . Was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine ..... Well , it was BOTH.It started a little slow , but I think that 's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing . But it quickly sucked me in . The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history . Mainly how we ( american 's ) learn history that is n't really true - and how we got to learn what we did . He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained , and interested . I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be.I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO . I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "" taught "" in the same type of manner as this episode ."	1
"Within the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May 's "" Darkman III : Die Darkman Die "" , we have already been subjected to a silly recap and accompanying voice - over on the first two films , hilarious over - acting , about three minutes of footage simply ripped from the second film and re - edited slightly to seem like new footage , and a lengthy advertisement the scarred and tormented title character watches about Universal Theme Parks- Universal being the company that distributed this film . Yes , "" Darkman III : Die Darkman Die "" is quite the handful when it comes to cheap cash - ins on the success of a previous film.This time around , the disfigured anti - hero Peyton Westlake ( aka , "" Darkman "" ; portrayed by "" Mummy "" actor Arnold Vosloo ) locks horns with evil crime - lord and lousy husband Peter Rooker ( played in a brilliantly over - the - top performance by Jeff Fahey ) , and over the course of the 87 minute film grows to develop an affection for Rooker 's wife and daughter , once again learning to care for another person.Blah . Blah . Blah.This film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make some more money off of Sam Raimi 's original film , which I consider to be a great action - suspense film.Oh yeah , and there are also a number of silly sub - plots , including a villainess who supposedly was one of the original doctors to save Darkman following his scarring , and her seducing our hero into thinking she is an ally before revealing her nefarious plot to help Rooker create more super - human powered thugs like Darkman . Apparently , she ca n't just do the same procedure on the thugs that she performed on Darkman . Why ? I ca n't really explain it , because the movie certainly doesn't.There 's also an assassination sub - plot involving a District Attourney who is threatening to bring down Rooker 's organization , and some other very silly things going on.But it does n't really add up . This film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film . The direction alternates between pretty good and downright sloppy ( a scene where Darkman rides his train - like vehicle and dodges a rocket - launcher is just plain silly ) , and the editing is a mixed - bag . The film just moves too quickly for anyone to really care what 's going on . And without spoiling it , the final 15 minutes of this movie , and indeed , the entire series is just kinda ... I dunno ... Another 15 minutes of mixed - bag footage.In fact , commenting on the editing , one of my favorite things in this film is watching for footage re - used from the previous films , and then looking for footage within this film that is repeated multiple times . Yes , it 's that cheap . It 's one thing to do a re - cap at the beginning of the film , and maybe repeat a shot or two , but in the sheer volume they do it ( minutes of footage repeated from previous films ) , it 's just sloppy and amateurish.Also , I have to say that Darkman 's psychedelic montage freak - outs are a bit overdone in this film . They are so stylized and overdone that they do work , but only in light doses and in proper context , as Raimi did in the original film . Here , there are at least four or five , and they feel very abrupt and out - of - place.That being said , the film is not without some good points . A few action scenes are well - done . The cliché story of Darkman yearning for a real life works suitably for a direct - to - DVD feature . Some of the acting is nice , particularly from Rooker 's wife , portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson . Also , while no Danny Elfman , composer Randy Miller composes some nice music that builds off of Elfman 's original themes.But overall , the film is too quick , cheap and silly to be taken seriously . Arnold Vosloo seems alternatively bored and exuberant from scene to scene , and Fahey , while a joy to watch as an over - the - top villain , just does n't quite fit in with the series.Like "" Darkman II "" , I would recommend this to fans of the original , who will surely get a laugh . Otherwise , you need not apply . A four out of ten ."	0
"And I mean ultra light . This film features four giant stars , about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.There really is n't too much to say about this stinker , other than that although it has a couple of really good bits , most of it is n't very funny . Nor does it work at all as a romance . How about as a romantic comedy ? Not on your life . Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated , much less amusing.What 's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all . This movie could have been so much more , especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted , complete with phony quotes from critics . The film uncovers the un - mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews . But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes , it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film 's lame romance.The same with Catherine Zeta - Jones ' character -- the whinny , self centered movie star . Zeta - Jones does a good job with what she 's given , but she 's given practically nothing . It 's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we 've heard about stars over the years.In the end , it is hard to understand what made Zeta - Jones , Julia Roberts , John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship , which sinks like a rerun of "" The Love Boat . "" In fact , as the old joke goes , they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal . It would probably make a better story . So , go ahead and tell us , filmmakers , what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this ?"	0
THE BROKEN is part of the After Dark Horrorfest III . Not a slasher or filled with gore . Plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis . A successful radiologist Gina McVay(Lena Headly)inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control . While attending her father's(Richard Jenkins)birthday party , the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason . Things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a London street in a car identical to her own . Gina sneaks to her doppelganger 's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father . She drives away and is involved in a head on collision . Then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same ; to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust . Is Gina beside herself ? Is she in a parallel world ? Her nightmares become more horrific ... is she broken?Kudos if you can figure this one out ... it wo n't be easy . Editing could n't be any tighter . Lighting is questionable .

With Harry Callahan getting up in years , the inevitable ` old man with a chip on his shoulder ' story had to come into play eventually . Callahan , looking fragile sometimes and out of place , his demeanor still was unwavering . Thankfully , this film took some time off to develop a different type of story , one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre . While the film fell short in doing so , it was still an excellent addition to the series , even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music .	1
"I can give you four reasons to see this movie:1 . Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema.2 . Four good stories , related into a big scheme.3 . A surprisingly good cast.4 . A bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country ( and many others).(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts . < br />Then Antonio Serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the Italian neorealism with a "" Peter and the wolf""-like anecdote.In the third story , the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context , Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment . But after the recent lynching at Tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the State of Mexico , this story could n't be more updated.And at the end , Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in the "" grand finale "" in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed . Reprising the center scene from one of his previous films "" Todo el poder "" , Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme . And by the way , give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti making a brief striptease.Once the movie has ended , you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie ( and maybe enjoyed it ) with a very painful subject . They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example . This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state(and perhaps accepted it ) , between two fires : The criminals and the so - called authorities full of corruption . Even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they do n't get this unhurt . If you had an assault without a scratch then you 're lucky . Meanwhile , do n't lose the chance to see this movie , highly recommended.And it 's a beautiful life in Mexico ..."	1

"I 've been working my way through a collection of Lugosi films recently , and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Karloff in "" The Black Cat "" I was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in "" The Raven . "" Alas , it just did n't work for me , and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed.For the first three quarters of this movie or so I thought the story lacked any real suspense . Lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad Dr. Vollins , some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman ( Irene Ware ) he treats after a car accident but who ca n't have her - partly because she 's already engaged , and partly because her father ( Samuel S. Hinds ) disapproves . To deal with that situation , he enlists the aid of Edmond Bateman ( Boris Karloff ) - a horribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him look more acceptable . Aside from Lugosi 's performance , though , I found little to hold my interest . Then , suddenly , in the last fifteen or twenty minutes , the movie shifts around completely . Suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful , but I thought Lugosi 's performance fell apart , largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane - and there 's a difference . He plays the "" mad "" role very well - controlled and in control but evil . "" Insane "" is a more out of control evil , and I did n't think Lugosi pulled that off well . At one point , he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake . In the meantime , Karloff was a huge disappointment . He never grabbed me at all . As an aside , it must have grated on Lugosi that - in movies in which they co - star - Karloff gets the top billing , even though in "" The Raven "" it 's clearly Lugosi who is the lead actor . This surely gives a hint as to how Universal ranked their two great horror stars - inexplicably , I would add , because I 've always thought of Lugosi as the better actor of the two.In any event , there 's no real connection here to Edgar Allen Poe 's story "" The Raven "" - except that Vollins is a Poe fanatic , who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from Poe 's stories . Overall , a disappointment . 4/10 ."	0
"I saw this film a couple of weeks ago , and it 's been stuck in my head ever since . It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary . To get the true story of the Beales , I had to wade through all of the DVD 's bonus material and commentaries and search the web.Although the Maysles and their fans ( not to mention Edith and Edie themselves ) bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative , this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word . Very little effort is every made to explain the Beales or how they came to the condition they were in - the Maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous . The sound , even on the Criterion re - release is poor and difficult to follow . Although I appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film , it 's ironic to compare it to Geraldo Rivera 's ( ! ) far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972 , four years before Grey Gardens was shot.To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker , there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives , and a documentary was n't one of them.As for Edith and Edie , the thing I kept thinking while watching the film was "" where the hell is their family "" ? They were living in dangerous , unhealthy , unsafe conditions . How is it that Jackie O , married to one of the richest men on Earth ( or the wealthy Bouvier family themselves ) could n't afford to get Edith and Edie a decent home ? Or at the very least hire a part - time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both ? It 's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family.Although this review may sound negative I would strongly recommend Grey Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries . Perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the rich backstory ( and afterstory ) of the Beales and the whole subsection of Hamptons society in the 1970 's ."	1
"Knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting , directing and acting . And it 's nice to see when a director / script get it right . Clocking in at just 82 minutes , 10 ITEMS OR LESS does n't stretch the story , trying to grasp at inane topics . It stays focused , being funny , sad , and well thought out.Morgan Freeman ( LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN ) stars as "" Him "" , an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him . We 're introduced to "" Him "" as he travels to a supermarket in an out - of - the - way section of town by The Kid ( Jonah Hill , CLICK ) . Realizing he has a star in his car , The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years . Him is n't very forthcoming because , not only has he been out of it for while , he 's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in ( "" I have n't decided if I 'm going to accept the part . "" ) . The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville . Stuck , Him decides to check out the local market . He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) who operates the 10 items or less register . Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent , Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role . He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.But Him does n't just use Scarlet , he helps her so he can see deeper into her life . They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband , and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she 's pining for , and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing . This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him , too , showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain - store retail world ( "" These shirts are only $ 12 bucks ! How is this possible ? ! "" ) The ending , as stated at the beginning of this review , is abrupt but apropos . There 's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond . They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other . It 's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet 's clunker car sits idling outside Him 's L.A. mansion.This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going . And it wo n't waste your time either ."	1
Without question , the worst film I 've seen for a long while . I endured to the end because surely there must be something here , but no . The plot , when not dealing in clichés , rambles to the point of non - existence ; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed ; characters never develop beyond sketches ; set - pieces are clichéd . Worse , considering its co - director , the photography is only so - so.Comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside Get Carter , Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way way off the mark ; Lives of the Saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading . In short , their craft . A ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30-minute short , but as it stands it 's a 6th form film project realised on a million - pound scale ; rambling and bloated with its own pretensions . That it received funding ( surely only because of Rankin 's name ) while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the British film industry .	0
Sorry to go against the flow but I thought this film was unrealistic , boring and way too long . I got tired of watching Gena Rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing .

"A Give this Movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10 . Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director Herbert Ross , and all of that makes this stage adaption come true . The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70 's . I love the type of humor in this film , it just makes me laugh so hard.I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago ( yes , VHS because it was cheaper - only $ 3 ) . I watched it as soon as I got home , but I had to watch it again because I kept missing a few parts the first time . The second time I watched it , it felt a lot better , and I laughed a lot harder . I 'm definitely going to re - get this on DVD because I HAVE to see the special features.It 's very funny how that happens . Two people work together as entertainers / actors / performers . They get along well on stage , but really argue off stage , they ca n't survive another minute with each other , then some 15 years later , you want to reunite them for a TV special . You can find that in this film . Matthau & Burns were terrific in this film . It 's a damn shame they died . George Burns deserved that Oscar . He gave a strong comic performance . He was also 78 when this movie was filmed . So far , he 's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age . Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress . Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this . He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor . He deserved that Golden Globe . Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say , everybody in this film gave a strong performance . This Comedy is an instant classic . I highly recommend it . One more thing : Whoever hates this film is a "" Putz """	1
"I heard and read many praising things about "" Midnight Meat Train "" , which is based on a short story written by no less than Clive Barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original "" Hellraiser "" that he directed himself , but so far I can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . The most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is : nauseating ! The violence is sadistic and extreme , which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts , but it 's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . Normally speaking , I 'm very pro - violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . The butchering  literally  depicted in "" Midnight Meat Train "" is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs , and even that is n't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . There are more shortcomings , some even bigger than the pointless gore , but perhaps I should focus on the good elements first . The basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences ( like the chase in the freezer room , for example ) are literally oozing with nail - biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . Unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . Presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities , but I honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by Vinnie Jones . The plot introduces Leon , an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . Leon 's right , as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer , but the killer 's motivations and behavior suggest there 's something far more substantial going on the rails at night . "" Midnight Meat Train "" takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs , plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images ( like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood ) , but director Ryûhei Kitamura ( "" Versus "" , "" Godzilla Final Wars "" ) does n't take full advantage of it all . The ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and , even if Clive Barker meant to have like this , I still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale . "" Midnight Meat Train "" is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film , but not without defaults . It 's not intended for easily offended viewers , but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well ."	0

My god , what 's going on ? a Uwe Boll film and positive comments ? Wow!Nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to Boll 's work . I myself , as I have stated in previous Uwe Boll reviews , only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good . I mean .. IT MUST HAPPEN ONE DAY!Alas , Seed is not that day . I do n't quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that Seed is . The thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net ..... or so Mr Boll believes . I still ca n't for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film . I understand the concept that Seed ( the killer ) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff ..... but ca n't understand why Mr Boll thought putting REAL footage in the film would work . Maybe to shock us ? Hmmm ..... well , I for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film . I DON'T though , find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest . If you were trying to shock me , it did n't work . It just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films . This sort of context may have worked for films in the 70/80 's ( Cannibal Holocaust ) but not todays market.With that out of the way , we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like BloodRayne 2 . You can just tell that there was n't a huge amount of money floating around for production.As per usual , Mr Boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of Seed 's victims in the first 25 mins . Each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim . It 's all very boring and tedious . I wo n't comment on the toddler scene as it 's laughable and just another cheap ' shock ' factor.If you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch Seed . The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old ' I 'm not using a steady cam ' fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2 . Watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as Seed is caught . This scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it . The cop actually tells Seed he could have shot him . For some un - be - known reason , the cop does n't shoot him . Given that Seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults , you 'd have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail.From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene , followed by the cops burying Seed alive ( and they know he is alive .. why not shoot him in the head ? ? ? ? ) , followed by Seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop 's family.What I 'm trying to get across to you all here is that it 's just plain STUPID ! It 's not even Hollywood horror stupid .... just plain dumb . Uwe Boll can not direct * * * * . Anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement . Anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person . < br />Once again we are treated to a poorly acted , directed , lighted , produced , scripted piece of UB crap .	0
I think I 've seen this sort of thing before : college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good , all the while , complaining that their lives suck.This movie is highly derivative of The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make of it : they practically have the same plot.If anything good came out of this snore - fest , it was the music . That was it.As far as I 'm concerned , I 'm not impressed ... but then again , I never expected anything less . This movie was directed by the same person that directed Batman and Robin ; another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow.Now for the verdict : it 's a 1 out of 10 .	0
"Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , and therefore having seen a large number of these films , it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique . For that matter , it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes . The love story is a little thin on the ground , but I 'd say that 's probably for the best , as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on "" comedy "" , and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com 's to do . The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film , but in any film I 've seen in a long while . I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a "" 10 "" over a "" 9 "" as a rating , as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately , and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact . I 'm also a big Meg Ryan fan , which helps , but this is one of the few films I 've seen in which I 'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed . She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads , but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals . A genuine laugh - out - loud type film ."	1
"Hitokiri ( which translates roughly as "" assassination "" ) , a / k / a "" Tenchu "" which translates roughly as "" divine punishment "" ) showcases Hideo Gosha at the top of his form . Do NOT miss this one , or Gosha 's other classic , Goyokin ! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha 's best films , it 's one of the best "" samurai / chambara "" films ever made , and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported.Be warned , all of the intricate plot details in Hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century Japanese history . Even so , the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers . As per the norm for Gosha , Hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of "" loyalty to one 's lord "" vs. "" doing the right thing "" . However , Gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication , that it 's really _ the _ movie to see ( along with Goyokin , of course).I suppose it breaks down like this : If you want a simpler , more action - oriented tale , you might want to see Goyokin . However , if you want a more thoughtful , multilayered ( albeit grim ) drama , see this one.(OK , OK , essentially , the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either ( 1 ) working to reform , yet retain , the Tokugawa Shogunate , and ( 2 ) those who are trying to install the Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan . Of course , those clans working "" for "" Emperor Meiji were often less interested in "" reforming "" Japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the "" new world order "" . Ironically , the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government . It 's ironic twists like this -- Gosha 's big on irony -- that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet.)What distinguishes "" Hitokiri "" from Gosha 's other movies is Gosha 's mature sense of cinematography . Every shot is thoughtfully composed , and ( much like Kubrick 's Barry Lyndon ) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition . Of course , this is typical Gosha . Hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops , including(as with Goyokin ) many riveting seascapes . Just watch the opening sequence , and you 're hooked ! Make no mistake , this is no English period piece : Hitokiri is extremely violent ( do n't say you were n't warned).What else , other than cool camera work , makes Hitokiri stand out ? The performances seem ( to me ) a bit more subtle in this one . Katsu Shintaro ( of Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame ) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist / antihero , Okada Izo . Katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain . Throughout the movie , you 're never quite sure if you 're engaged or revolted by Okada 's character . At the same time , Katsu 's portrayal of Okada 's ravenous hunger for respect , and his later pathetic attempts at redemption , seem so human that you ca n't help but feel empathy / sympathy . Of course , after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya play the tortured hero in "" Goyokin "" , it 's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in "" Hitokiri "" . He 's just perfect , there 's nothing more to say!As a final note , perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans , do n't miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio ( yes , the closeted gay right - wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering Japanese military personnel he "" kidnapped "" in 1970 , and had a movie on his life and work made by Paul Schrader ) , who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable ( for an assassin ) Shinbei Tanaka ."	1
This is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home . Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow , young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family . Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey ( 1993 ) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham . It 's a remake of a 1963 film . This movie got a sequel three years later . Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to do the voice - over for Chance . Fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role . Sally Field does great voice work as Sassy . Don Ameche is fantastic as Shadow . This was this veteran actor 's second last movie . Also the visible actors are great . Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford - Seaver . Robert Hays is Bob Seaver . Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford . Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford . Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver . Jean Smart portrays Kate . It 's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness . We see Sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner . The bear scene is exiting and funny . Chance has no chance with that big , hungry bear . And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful . This is some great fun for the whole family .	1
"Medellin is a fabulous place to live , work , and study . I 've been there twice , and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities , paramilitaries taking tourists hostage , or anything of the sort . There are "" invisible police , "" but it is * not * a Big Brother system . There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life , but they do not hassle someone without good reasons.La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters . The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra , and when a "" character "" dies , there is genuine pathos . It is difficult to imagine , however , that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro , a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country.La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia ; there are , of course , things to be wary of such as petty crime , but when one considers pickpocketing happens in "" modern "" cities such as London , New York , or Tokyo , Colombia does n't seem that different after all . Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war - torn country is now prospering more than ever ."	0
My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience . Film and alternative cinema ( small hall , with uncomfortable seats ; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed ) were perfect match.There were many cliches used in the film , but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really amusing . Sound was also brilliant ( sometimes back being louder than dialogue).Everything seemed to be in right place . And I loved the way how after - war - time was presented . Real fun!<br / >	1
"This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife , the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis . That would have been a movie worth seeing . Instead it 's a Paul Reiser vehicle , with a little Falk thrown in . The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie , but you 'd hardly know it . I presume Reiser is under the impression that he 's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle . He 's not . Even more galling is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background . Dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes , but when she does , the screen glows . The story is about Falk and Dukakis really , but we 're subjected to a pointless , silly , preposterous road trip in which Reiser gets to show how very cute , precious and oh - so - deep with psychological insight ( wrong ! ) he can be . For instance , In a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser had hoped was "" Cassavetes - like "" there 's a laughably false confrontation between Reiser and Falk that is so patently ridiculous , I was embarrassed for Falk ."	0
so , being a fairly deep fan of horror movies , it 's been a while since i 've seen one that really made me jump ( or fidget nervously.)definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out ... a hell of a lot better than the ring . the thing that i do n't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible , well , if that 's what you think , then so be it ... i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared , so i have to say that this one is worth watching.now , you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line , because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story ( i think that if it was shown in chronological order , it would have ruined the whole thing.)i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it ... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you do n't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid .	1
"I chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move . It was n't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious . The girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible . It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing . Terrible movie with a surf "" theme "" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers . Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now , being married with Gordon Gekko and all , but if you have n't seen it do n't waste your time . A bad movie with GREAT surfing , REAL surfers and AMAZING , BEAUTIFUL cinematography was IN GOD 'S HANDS ."	0
"When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague ( a variant of bubonic plague ) , U.S. Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed ( Richard Widmark ) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body . Unfortunately , the stiff got that way by being murdered , and there 's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague , leading to an epidemic . Enter Police Captain Tom Warren ( Paul Douglas ) , who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster.While Panic in the Streets is a quality film , it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling ( my reason for bringing the score down to an eight ) . It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster , police procedural , thriller and even romance.This is not director Elia Kazan 's best work , but saying that is a bit disingenuous . Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire ( 1951 ) , On The Waterfront ( 1954 ) and East of Eden ( 1955 ) , after all . This film predates those , but Kazan has said that he was already "" untethered "" by the studio . Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl . The film is set in New Orleans , a city where Kazan "" used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well "" . He wanted to exploit the environment . "" It 's so terrific and colorful . I wanted boats , steam engines , warehouses , jazz joints -- all of New Orleans"".Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well , but they could be connected better . The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods . The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked . Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt , "" Quarantine "" and "" Some Like ' Em Cold"".The gangster material , which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film , is probably the highlight . Not surprisingly , Kazan has said that he believes the villains are "" more colorful -- I never had much affection for the good guys anyway . I do n't like puritans "" . A close second is the only material that approaches the "" panic "" of the title -- the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed , inoculate them and contain the disease . While there is plenty of suspense during these two "" moods "" , much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama , with pacing more typical of that genre.The dialogue throughout is excellent . The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced . It is intelligent , delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character . Conflict is n't created by "" dumb "" decisions but smart moves ; events and characters ' actions are more like a chess game . When unusual stances are taken , such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers , he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions , which other characters argue over.In light of this , it 's interesting that Kazan believed that "" propriety , religion , ethics and the middle class are all murdering us "" . That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm , or allowances away from it , made by the protagonists . For example , head gangster Blackie ( Jack Palance in his first film role ) is offered a "" Get Out of Jail Free "" card if he 'll cooperate with combating the plague.The technical aspects of the film are fine , if nothing exceptional , but the real reasons to watch are the performances , the intriguing scenario and the well - written dialogue ."	1
Let 's cut to the chase : If you 're a baby - boomer , you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that , in 1976 , McCartney had the gumption to drop in on John 's city hermit life and spend the day with him . You also certainly wondered how things went . I heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard , from John 's and Paul 's perspective , and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does . But none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does . I found it amazingly lifelike , perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin - free . Now , can anyone explain why I did n't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night ? I mean it 's already three years old , for goodness sake ! And yes , if you 're a Beatles fan , this is a must - see performance ! Even the subtle paraphrasing of Beatles ' melodies in the background is inspired .	1
When I first picked this film up I was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen . I 'm a fan of animation and love it when it 's successfully merged with live action footage . However , the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed . Although it must be said that the actors ' performances were excellent . The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece . However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery , both visual and in the script , that you were practically hammered over the head with . Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot . It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece . The voice overs from Felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing ( and even that was n't properly addressed ) . I 'm afraid the whole piece came across as , at best , a ' reasonable first attempt ' , by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence . Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all .	0
"I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970 's . I was of the tender age of 6 , my brother 4 , then again when I was 8 my brother 6 . This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust . It was n't just the movie , but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many "" christians "" about the "" mark of the beast""and the rapture . This movie , the church , and a volatile neglectful upbringing , lead to severe paranoia towards the future . For years , I lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by Christ . I am now 40 years old . Went through years of counseling . I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family . I was pegged with a delusional disorder . I actually began to believe this , it was my brother who reminded me , that this cultic philosophy actually happened . I no longer fear the future , I have come to terms with the fear injected into it 's members by the church . I have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose , I am nearing my licensure as a Psychologist specializing in childhood trauma ."	0
"Title : Robot Jox ( 1990 ) < br />Director : Stuart Gordon < br />Cast : Gary Graham , Anne Marie Johnson , Paul Koslo < br />Review : Stuart Gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as Re - Animator , From Beyond , Dagon and Castle Freak , took a small detour here and did a little sci - fi flick . I stress the word "" little "" since this is a very low budget flick , and there in lies its main weakness.The story takes place in the future . A world in which the great superpowers ( that according to this movie are the United States and Russia ) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war ... but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots . Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander . Lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.Well , the idea is awesome I guess . The great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots ? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available . Unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.I as a kid loved this movie , and I guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie , you 'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it . I showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like "" what the hell is this piece of crap franco ? "" And I 'm like well this movie is a sci - fi by one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon ? "" But as the movie progressed into corny territory I almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture . I could go through it , cause I loved this film as a kid , and there 's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it . But everyone else was just not going to get it.And I myself realized that the movie is n't really that good . First off . The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other . And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you 'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work , expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief . But unfortunately this being a small scale movie , from a small scale company ( Empire Pictures , which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them . Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.OK granted , once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other . There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool , and made me go "" that s why I liked thid movie ! "" But every know and them , some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in . And boom , your right back into realizing this film just does n't live up to its premise.And heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie . This movie is basically a movie for kids . You know , giant robots duking it out ? Stop motion animation ? Hello ? But this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody . So I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not ? After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities , which really is n't a good mix.So for those of you who do n't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you do n't have a nostalgic connection to this movie ( like I do ) well I d suggest you steer clear away from this one . Gordons a great director , but this movie he made , just did n't do it for me . Well , at least not now that I 'm a full grown adult.Rating : 2 out of 5"	0
""" Pecker "" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age . A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s , but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do . Over the years , the budget of Waters ' films has increased considerably . This is one of his most recent productions , but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that "" trailer - park "" touch . Edward Furlong plays Pecker , a kid who is obsessed with photography . He lives a quite life in Baltimore , MD , with his friends and family . But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent ( the always watchable Lili Taylor ) , and his life changes for the worst . Once again , Waters makes fun of art , fame and heterosexuality . It is not among his best films , but there are some big belly laughs here ( "" Memama "" has the best lines in the film ! ) . It is consistently clever and funny , and has that very "" queer "" sensibility that I have come to love in Warters ' movies ."	1
"The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . It 's obvious he has n't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well - meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . If only it was that easy . But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . Well , if you 're not part of the solution , you 're part of the problem.The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever - expanding bloodbath . Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation . Where does it end ? And apparently he missed the significance of "" the bubble "" referred to in the name , which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . ( He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he was n't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . ) < br />I found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star - crossed lovers , to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . Let 's be honest here : Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female ( young love wins all hearts ) -- but when people 's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them HATE each other , then the conclusion is inevitable ."	1
""" Serum "" starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the "" Re - animator "" movies , and it owes a lot to them . The story is very similar ; a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain , sickness and death , but he 's apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a brain - eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew . The zombie even looks like one of those from "" Re - animator , "" and in fact some of the make - up effects in "" Serum "" are n't bad . Unfortunately , the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places , resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 3/4 of the movie . For some reason , the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen . I ca n't see why this was important , other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing ; sometimes , that would n't be present otherwise as the plot plods along.There are a number of moments that just do n't add up here . For instance , one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer , but when we see the victim 's head up close , there 's no sign of that trauma . In another scene , a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor ( we can see the circles of light on the floor , in fact ) with a flashlight in hand , looking for all the world like he 's walking in the dark ... but a moment later a second character walks down the same fully - lit corridor without one . These are just a couple of examples ; moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the movie.""Serum "" is better in some ways than much of what goes straight - to - video as independent horror lately . In terms of technical items  sound and photography , for example  it 's got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a DVD . On the other hand , there 's still a good deal of wooden acting ( particularly by one of the lead characters , the mad scientist himself ! ) and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity . Maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with , though . One of the problems with low - budget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets , and that almost never works out . It did n't in the case of "" Serum , "" anyhow ."	0
"The main problem of the first "" Vampires "" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic . Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire . The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since Blade 's Deacon Frost . Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene ( why did n't Carpenter use more of this ? ? ) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been . I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence ( for example inside a city ) and was left somewhat disappointed . While "" Los Muertos "" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor , it still drags a little in some parts ( though nowhere near as bad as "" Vampires "" did ) . Much like "" Vampires "" however this movie 's climax near the end is not very intense.Most of the above may sound like "" Los Muertos "" is a bad movie but it definitely is n't . It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre . It is neither an unoriginal Dracula remake ( like almost every other vampire movie out there ) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like Blade II . It simply could have used a bit more excitement.I'd really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter but it 's probably not going to happen.SPOILER WARNING The ending was way too predictable . Una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual ."	1
"My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section , but I could n't find a place for it . I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U.S. in Feb. , 1955 . I saw it in a "" first run "" theater in Washington , D.C. in March , 1958 . Wonder if it was re - released , or some problem ? In my opinion , this movie is very light entertainment , but has some classic characters . John McIntyre does a bang - up job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief . Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier . And , in my opinion , James Stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did . I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more , and never tire of seeing parts of it again . The photography and scenery are splendid , and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty - six minutes ."	1
In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr. Anthony Blake ( David Gale , the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it 's definitely Dr. Blake not Dr. Blakely ) is the director and founder of the famed ' Psychological Research Institute ' and also host 's a local T.V. programme called ' Independent Thinkers ' . He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence . Dr. Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it 's spinal cord as a tail thingy . Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank , eats mice and the odd bad actor , each time it eats someone it gets much bigger . Meanwhile at the local high - school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski ( Tom Bresnahan ) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets . Jim is sent to Dr. Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems . While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to , well something I 'm not actually sure what . This whatever it is , is attached to the brain . At first Jim is able to resist the brain 's mind control . The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it 's plans . Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car . Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet ( Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston ) but is handed back to Dr. Blake 's assistant Verna ( George Buza ) soon after by Officer Marks ( Harry Booker ) . The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it 's mind control techniques , and with ' Independent Thinkers ' going national the brain does n't want anything or anyone to stop it 's evil plan for world domination ! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain , before it takes over the world!Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here , the Brain was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be . Do n't get me wrong as it certainly is n't great either . The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline . It moves along at a fair pace and is n't too boring . No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all , it 's just there and that 's it we have to accept it . The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element , there 's the T.V. mind control , the brain itself , Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr. Blake that is n't explained at all . Production wise this film looks cheap , and probably was cheap . The acting is n't great but I 've seen worse , and what is David Gale doing in this ? In fact this role is similar to Gale 's role in Re - Animator ( 1985 ) even down to his character 's deaths in both films . The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big . Each stage is just made of rubber . It does n't look particularly good and is n't scary or creepy , just cheap . There 's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you 'll miss it decapitation . The nudity is provided by Dr. Blake 's assistant Vivian ( Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack ) before she gets eaten . The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it . Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V. for free .	0
I finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting for so long .... and unfortunately , it was n't worth it ! Even for a die hard Lynch fan , I found this to be really tedious .... nothing happens , there are long , long , long painful pauses where nothing happens , long , monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing , or caring , what the hell it was all about , what happened before and what happened afterward . < br />There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita -esque , and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but can not be talked about clearly . < br />Unfortunately , It 's all very uninteresting and very dull , nothing happens , it 's very forgettable and I think i will delete it from my computer and forget I ever watched it . Sorry David !	0
This is a very fine and poetic story . Beautiful scenery . Magnificent music score . I 've been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling . The movement of the camera is superb , as well as the actors . It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic . Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it 's all very well brought onto the screen here . The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details . Once you 've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director . It 's a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody .	1
"The film had some likable aspects . Perhaps too many for my taste . It felt as though the writer / director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of ALL of its characters . Not once , a few times ... but all of the time . < br />This is the job of television , not cinema . < br />The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler 's performance as the pregnant friend . < br />I felt as though Justine Clarke 's performance was wan . Her reactions to things felt forced , as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist 's expressions . I also ca n't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence . < br />I can not understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences . This is a lazy device , especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest . < br />That said , there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality . It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine . Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity , infusing it with passion and hand - crafted charm . < br />I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked . "" Who knows if there 's a god ? Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do "" or whatever the line was . < br />Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife "" I 'm giving up smoking . "" < br />An anti - smoking commercial ? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation ? I had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much ."	0
There were only two things that kept me interested in this film : I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die , and Catherine Zeta Jones.This was basically a one woman show . Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye - candy . Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film . Like Jones , he had no role at all . The film was all Lily Taylor ( Ransom , Ready to Wear ) . She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self . OK , it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.I do n't know what director Jan de Bont 's problem was . he did a great job with Speed and Twister . he really fell down on the job here . Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2 : Cruise Control . He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West , else this would be the worst picture of 1999.Avoid at all costs .	0
"( BIG SPOILERS ) I 've seen one other Takashi Miike film , and that was the very disturbing and brutal ' Audition ' , which was an examination of the Japanese ideals of femininity ! In ' Visitor Q'- which I think means ' Visitor Question'- he examines , in a very disturbingly gross way , the family unit . Miike 's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and film - making , but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue . We , the audience , are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure ( Kenichi Endo- who was actually quite good ) paying for sex with his displaced daughter ( Fujiko ) . Then , as the father returns home , he is struck on the head by "" the visitor "" ( Kazushi Watanabe ) wielding a fairly sizeable rock , and for some reason , they both end up back at the family home . The mother ( Shungiku Uchida ) is beaten and bullied by her son ( Jun Muto ) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers . When the visitor enters the home , he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit . Eventually , the family begin to improve their relationship , with assistance from the visitor , through milking breasts , murder and retaining a sense of family pride.And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together . It 's has uncomfortable humour , but is equally frustratingly silly , and over - the - top in its weirdness . There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting , but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses . Partly because of the situation itself , and partly because you ca n't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this ! The style of the film is poor to say the least , and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak . The characters themselves are all over the place , and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic , there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd ! The camera - work is sloppy , and does n't have that cinematic feel that Lynch 's work entails . It 's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level , or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan . It just seems that Miike was out to shock , and the film seems self - aware that it 's "" trying "" to be shocking , and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously . All in all , I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy , but it looks and feels amateurish , and seems to unnecessarily want to shock . Miike 's previous film , Audition , was finely balanced between disgusting horror , character development and technique- which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot . ' Visitor Q ' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting , without really having much to say in the process ! < br /><br / > * * out of * * * * * !"	0
"For all of the hype about this film , I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think . And , although a bit slow at times , the first 90 % of the movie is quite good , with more than a few "" old time "" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled . I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes . Where Dark Remains fails , however , is in its climax . The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body . The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and , the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma ? - was not elucidated upon ! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best , and in the end , I felt very cheated . What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending ."	0
This was a wonderful film . How these women tried to save their husbands . I thought that the performances of the actors were great . I had to think about the film for a very long time . I think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war , relationships , friendship and love . I liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be . I wish I could be so strong as a woman . I really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what I like to see in a movie . I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang , The pianist . If you put these three films together , you have a great sight of what happened during the war . We should remember something like the war forever .	1
I go to the cinema to be entertained . There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film . From beginning to end , there is no respite from the gray , grinding reality of this woman 's life . It is one - paced , with no change of mood . I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better . They do n't , and I do n't think I was the only one , as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close . Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime , but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public . A dreadful film .	0
It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend 's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park ( a new episode ) . The thing is , in my country , South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing , Father of the Pride . I 'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes . The first time I watched it , I found it unfunny and crude for nothing , so I thought ' ' Holy sh*t , I have a football game early tomorrow , so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons ' ' . But yesterday , I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance . I find that it 's a complete rip - off of The Simpsons , only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.The second thing is I wonder why it got it 's TV-14 rating . I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar , and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual ( unfunny ) jokes . The Simpsons is also a lot more violent ( Halloween specials ) and crude . I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2 , well I 've got news for him : Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic . However , I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile ( even burst out laughing once ) three or four times.All in all , I do n't mind Father of the Pride . I do n't hate it , but I do n't like either . I 've seen way better from ' ' The Simpsons''.3.5/10	0
I rated this a ten just because I find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera . It 's no epic but it 's plenty engaging and I was never bored . If tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse , then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens . I know I 'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release . Damn good job , and well worth the money . What a script ! It might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures I 've seen lately . Nanavati knows how to tell a story , both in writing and on screen . Serious kudos to her , ca n't wait to see more .	1
I truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as I was a huge fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad . Until this . This complete trash ruined Robin for me for a long time . I 'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in Fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake , Bicenntinial Man i think it was called but the point is . Robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this ' classic ' .	0
"I 'm a big fan of movies that make you think . I 'm still thinking long and hard about this one , fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled . What 's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body , made extra - tacky by being filmed on cheap video . This happens three times and I was certain it would be explained in the end . I put my trust in the film - makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified . It was not.The movie has to be the most apathetic I 've come across in the genre . The sets look like a cross between a 1970s Dr Who set and someone 's ill - formed idea of a sponge - painted living room . The lighting is unimaginative ( if your sets are going to be that bad , at least film them in semi - darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance ) . Of the abducted quartet , the girl stands out as being particularly lame , but none of them is given a personality . The aliens ' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved . Most of the movie consists of people running down corridors . Yes , it really is that exciting . The "" ray gun "" special effect is ... curious , to say the least ( what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill , and even then the guy comes back for more ? ) . The script is like a bad episode of The A - Team , and the ladies ' hairstyles come from the same era , so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders . When we finally get to see what the aliens really look like , they 're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes . The resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who 's never had an idea more complex than a Saturday morning cartoon ( I mean the bad ones with no plot , action , or characterization ) in his or her life.But seriously , what is with the naked chick ? ! Was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to boost sales ?"	0
Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time ; Meet Me in St Louis , The Bad and the Beautiful . I awaited this movie with great interest . But what a disappointment . < br />Some Came Running is scene after scene of go - nowhere fatalism . Sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project . The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens . The sequence is intended to be tension - filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock ; he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he does n't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly - drawn and poorly developed we do n't particularly care that they get shot . ( especially MacClane ) But that 's the only real cinematography in the project . Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours . Hell IS other people , apparently.There is nothing going on in this movie . The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in ' The Best Years of Our Lives . ' And either of two Inge products , ' Splendor in the Grass ' and ' Picnic ' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead - end town , with much more poignance .	0
""" Scary Movie 2 "" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise . Scary Movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny . Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night . Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie is n't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things . It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I do n't think you will like it nearly as much ."	0
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline . But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed . This gullible family ends up driving through this "" deserted "" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear , the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them . Their are more gaps than I can count and they do n't explain anything that happens how or what . It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something ( which is never explained ) . The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused ."	0
Since I had loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80 's , I went to see this movie . I wasted my money . The plot was very thin . Also , the movie could not keep me interested for long . I was glad it was over.If you want to see Inspector Gadget , watch the cartoon instead . It was much better than the movie .	0
"Paul Verhoeven ( genius and master film maker ) strikes back with the less than perfect , yet still fun in a "" dirty old man type of way , "" Hollow Man . The first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints . Yet I am giving a recommendation to this film for it 's MIND BLOWING special effects ( perhaps the best so far around ) and two dandy performances by the leads . Verhoeven 's moral questions are of course thought provoking , and although the film turned off many , this movie is pretty soft - core for old Verhoeven.Two major flaws : Josh Brolin ( aka walking ape - man ) and the whole deal with the elevator . If there was an access ladder , why were they trapped down in the lab ? < br />A fun horror film for a Saturday night ."	1
Wow I really liked this movie , William H. Macy is great as the quiet hit - man Alex.All the performances here are really good , the plot is interesting and entertaining.Alex , a married hit - man ( like his father)with a little son , is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit Sarah of whom he falls in love to . One day Alex does n't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows . < br />I recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies.8 stars = very good	1
I absolutely adore the ' Toxic Avenger ' series , but this weak offering by the Troma people did n't make any sense , and it had me yawning all the time.A leaking nuclear plant ( and the growing weed next to it ) makes the youngsters of Tromaville High go nuts , which causes them to join a gang , have sex , explode , and whatever . Also there 's some sort of monster breeding in the high school ... my God , this movie 's a mess.The actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should . The ( intended ) overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... Disappointing . 2/10 .	0
"I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind - teasing message should look like . Definitely , The Broken is not one of those movies . I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I 've read in prior comments , they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people . the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain . It 's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless . So , you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before . Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue . Had the clues been planted more in the movie , one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed . But though the movie was so slow in pace , it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all . And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments . Furthermore , if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end , then how come she is the evil one ? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion : This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time . Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all . I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies . Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages ! They 're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest , I guess . Horror movies should have blood , screams , intensity , skeletons , body organs and parts . Because that is the real horror and it 's never away from reality . I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising . Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of . For instance , the horror movie "" Train "" with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with "" Hostel "" , it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message , it is still very poorly presented and the least scary . I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex , TV , safety / being pampered , etc ... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me . And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial , are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply do n't like this genre but this does n't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils , ecstasy , leadership lessons ( believe it or not ! ) , entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life , as ugly and scary as it may seems , Death !"	0
"Back to the roots with "" like it is in heaven "" - what are the real values of life ? These Swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart . We 've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat : love pure and joy within the music of a choir that 's simple , yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone . < br />From the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth , now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage , Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple , warm and rough people of the North.He wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionally.Don't go see it if you 've been normed to Hollywood . This stuff contains no extras , just your laughter , your compassion , your tears !"	1
Just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity ; awful acting , plus , the lovemaking scenes are the most un - sexy I 've ever seen ( and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love , since I 'm gay).Again , as in Mil nubes de paz , Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it ... And this time , there is n't even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about ! God gracious have mercy on us !	0
"As a biographical film , "" The Lady With Red Hair "" ( the story of how director /producer / playwright David Belasco transformed notorious society divorcee Mrs. Leslie Carter into an international stage star ) is certainly not in a league with that other Warner 's biopic of similar vintage , "" Yankee Doodle Dandy "" ( what is ? ) , but "" Lady "" is an enjoyable film in its own right -- AND shares quite a few traits in common with the Cagney classic . < br />Like "" Yankee Doodle Dandy , "" "" The Lady With Red Hair "" brims over with old -time show - business flavor . ( Among other things , both films feature delicious theatrical boarding - house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers ' offices . ) Also , in "" Lady "" as in the Cohan biopic , the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period , all doing the sort of top - notch work we remember them for . < br />Need I add that , again like "" Yankee Doodle Dandy , "" "" The Lady With Red Hair "" does n't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story ? But , also like "" Dandy , "" "" Lady "" does manage -- gloriously!--to convey the esssence of its show - business - giant hero 's larger - than - life personality . Everyone knows that Cagney limned Cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in "" Yankee Doodle Dandy""--but few moviegoers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in "" The Lady With Red Hair""- -and did it with a panache that almost equals Cagney's.Rains - as - Belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman 's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory . Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable , superbly observed , and remarkably true - to - life performance as the man all Broadway once called "" The Wizard . "" To watch Claude Rains in action ( looking in every shot as if he 's having a helluva good time ! ) in "" The Lady With Red Hair "" is to see David Belasco leap to life on film as if he ca n't wait to shake things up on the Main Stem once again.<br / >"	1
"Strummer 's hippie past was a revelation , but overall this felt like crashing a wake . Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire . There were just too many semi - boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage . I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now ( FU Mick Jones ) , but this doc left me wanting .. to relate more . Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent . They should have been interviewed on their own . Even using Strummer 's ' radio DJ voice ' did little to glue the film together . And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes ? After the awesome "" Filth And The Fury "" I hoped Temple could deliver . A Joe Strummer doc deserves better ."	0
Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.Boring direction and performances ( with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material , and the ever earnest Charlton Heston ) earn the rating of a real stinker.It 's amazing to watch Heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is . He even plays in a sub - plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie . The way they ended up resolving it was that they did n't . It simply falls off the end.Really . Do n't waste your time on this one .	0
This film has a lot of raw potential . The script is sharp , the dialogue is ( usually ) excellent ( though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice - overs ) , the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good , though some of the experimentation just does n't work . The main problem here is David Duchovny . Once a geek - boy , always a geek - boy ; and the sad , simple fact is that he 's incapable of playing anything but Fox Mulder . He postures , he tries to be slick , he poses , he tries to be macho . In the end he just tries too hard . He overplays his character , he overspeaks his lines , and he 's just outplayed in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie , who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill . Timothy Hutton was ( as always ) really good . There was a spotty moment or two where he over - dramatized his role , but you could tell he was having fun with it . He looked the part , and he became the character both physically and atmospherically . Angelina Jolie was also really good . She did n't have much of a role ; in fact , I though she could have used a much stronger one ... her character was n't nearly developed enough , though she did remarkably well with what she had . And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent ( gee , maybe that 's why Uma left him ... ; ) All in all , it was rough around the edges , but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles . If David Duchovny had n't ripped his role to pieces it would 've been * that * much better . 7/10 .	1
I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it . I would recommend it to other people . It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot . And I am thinking since it 's close to Halloween they might play it more . So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it . I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well . I really like her as an actress and person . She seems so nice and down to earth . Kevin Dillon he 's performance was so so for me . I am not trying to knock him or anything but I believe that his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better . Kevin just seems too sweet for me . But I think he did okay .	1
This is a so called ' feel - good ' movies , however it made me sad in a way . Why ? Because I had the talent , but my parents did n't let me study at the sports academy , as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer.And soccer is the red line in this movie . Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have . An English - Indian girl and her parents , with their traditions and strong family ties , and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dresses like a boy , and plays soccer ... a combination which worries her mother ! This movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people , as well as the Indian community in England . It is about believe in your dreams , and live your one life ( where did we hear that before).Paraminder Nagra ( a beautiful women ! ) plays Yasminda , a girl who is not interested in boys , new clothes , make - up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff . In contradiction with her sister Pinky , complete the opposite of Yasminda.A real must it is , to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents , and finds her luck eventually . With great music from Blondie , Curtis Mayfield , Texas , Melanie C , as well as Indian hit songs.Pleasant to watch , but if you , as myself , ever played soccer , and never made it to the top , then this movie will make you melachonic .	1
Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how ? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago , I can say that there is little if anything from the original book . I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these.This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name . This is not the story of Carlito Brigante , it is the story of a totally different character who 's been given the same name . They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito 's Way fan out there ; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman , who plays a crucial character in the original movie , in a different role.What 's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original , untouched material of the book Carlito 's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen . I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non - fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia 's most feared underworld figure , instead they made a ho - hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook ( though Eric Bana 's performance was spot - on ) . Now we will never get to see Carlito 's real initial rise and fall.The three stars is because , looking at it purely as a stand - alone flick , it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances ( Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but he could be good in other roles ) and the story is not too bad . Even Puffy Combs suits his role . But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time ( I am a bit of a crime - non - fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right ( having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres).The fact is though , it 's not a stand alone - it 's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed .	0
I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old . Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night . Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it.This is really not an ordinary horror movie . It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy . I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes . Especially the scene when Anna 's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.Now to the plot . This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill . While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse . When she fells a sleep , which often strangely happens just immediately , she finds herself near the house on a big green field . She realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams . One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to . As she forgets to draw his legs ( because he is sitting behind a window ) the boy can not walk . Later she is being told by the doctor , that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn , she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams . She also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams . As she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house . She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting . She tries to rubber him out but realizes that she can not change anything already drawn . And next time she falls asleep the horror begins . Her father is mad and blind ( because she draw s * * * on his head to mark him as ' invalid ' ) and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill Anna and his friend . Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare . They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up . Than Anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed . The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so . They tell Anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings . Anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to . She runs to the watchtower and meets the boy ( I am just not mentioning his name because I can not remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page ) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever.There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie . First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike . I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short . How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to Anna as he is supposed to be dead ? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ? I hated that scene it was so dumb to me . It almost ruined the main horror scene.Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of Anna 's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene . I liked the boy . The actor was awesome . He was even better than Anna . I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage.Overall a good movie . I give it a 8 out of 10 .	1
"As someone who has read the book , I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow . There are various reasons for this . Firstly , Emma is too unpleasant . Yes , she has faults , and is n't the easiest person to like - but the viewer should n't downright start to despise her . Secondly , Mr Knightly is miscast . His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen , and throw the mood of the whole affair "" off "" . Thirdly , Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet ; and why was she made to look so sickly ? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she 's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene . Fourthly , the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut . At the end , when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly , it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative has n't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film . Fifthly , what was going on , exactly , with Mrs Elton 's accent ? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning , to all out American half - way through , and then back to English at the end . Finally , this dragged at the end . The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly . This version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony.All in all , a rather haphazard attempt . Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead"	0
"Retitled from its original Japanese name of LAPUTA ( for being an offensive phrase , something which director Hayao Miyazaki was oblivious to at the time ) , CASTLE IN THE SKY is the master animator 's third film , and it 's one of his most beloved of all time . Initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release , it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world . Inspired by Jonathan Swift 's "" Gulliver 's Travels "" , CASTLE IN THE SKY is a steampunk - themed action adventure tale about two young orphans -- young miner Pazu , and mysterious girl Sheeta ( who wears a magic crystal around her neck ) -- who team up to find the long - lost island of Laputa , which is rumored to have great riches and gems . They are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty Dola ( who at first chase them , yet turn out to be true allies ) and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost - secret agent , Muska , who wants the power of Laputa for his own benefit.For anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours , this film is an excellent choice , featuring just the right amount of humor , exploration , wonder , and mystery to keep one interested . The artwork , although not as spectacular as in some of Miyazaki 's later movies , is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations , incredibly exciting action scenes , and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy . And while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than Miyazaki 's other works , each has a memorable , endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over . Dola , in particular , makes for a terrific comic character , shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of Sheeta the next . Muska is one of the few Miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain , but like Dola , he commands every scene he 's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly.Anime fans have often compared this movie to Gainax 's sci - fi adventure series NADIA : THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER . After all , both works share similar story and character elements ... not to mention that they were both created by Miyazaki himself . Where both differ is in their execution . NADIA , although charming for the most part , suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point , devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot , even though it did have a strong ending . CASTLE IN THE SKY , on the other hand , remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time , and is all the better for it . While the film 's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some "" cartoonish "" moments , like a brawl between Pazu 's boss and one of Dola 's sons , it 's never to the point that it detracts from the film.About eleven years ago , Disney released an English version featuring a cast of big - names such as James van der Beek , Anna Paquin , Cloris Leachman , Mark Hamill , Mandy Patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as Tress MacNeille and Jim Cummings . It also features an ambitious reworking of Joe Hisaishi 's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the Seattle Music Orchestra ( interestingly , the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself ) . As much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore , Miyazaki had no such problems ; in fact , he is said to have applauded the reworking , and for good reason , because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub . While there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original Japanese is a bit jarring ( notably the journey through a dragon - infested storm cloud ) , the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original , particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end . Here , Hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals . < br />As far as the performances in the dub go , the leads are probably at the short end of the stick ; James Van Der Beek 's Pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character , while Anna Paquin 's Sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times ( a problem which actually works in favor of the character ) . That said , both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout . It 's the lively supporting cast , however , that really make this dub so much fun , particularly Cloris Leachman 's Dola and Mark Hamill 's Muska . Both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they 're in ; as with the rescore , these two really warrant a listen to the Disney dub . The script adaptation borders on the loose side at times -- there 's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary ( some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone)--but aside from at least one debatable alteration ( Sheeta 's speech in the climactic showdown "" the world can not live without love "" as opposed to the original "" you ca n't survive apart from Mother Earth "" ) , the overall characters , story , and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original . On the whole , there is little point comparing the Disney version to the original language track ; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece , and I like them both . ( They 're also better than Streamline / JAL 's more literal but frightfully robotic , lifeless , abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980 's ; do n't believe anybody who says this version is "" superior "" to Disneys -- trust me , the opposite is true . ) < br />Either way , though , you ca n't go wrong with CASTLE IN THE SKY . It 's one of Miyazaki 's all - time greatest , and I highly recommend it ."	1
I 'm a bit conflicted over this . The show is on one hand awful , the acting is terrible ( even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode ) , the dialogue is moronic and the premise / moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short . There 's no way you 'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes , and Robert Englund 's cameos are short , pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America 's Funniest Home Videos kind of way.On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television . The 80s fashions , the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times , the premises lend the material more to self - parody than scares , so we 're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT 's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him , another is afraid she 'll be locked up in prison because she 's a substandard mom ( her husband is played by Brad Pit ) , another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home , another is afraid she 'll be confused with her socially - retarded twin , another is afraid if he does n't break up his mom and step - dad he 'll get killed for having a party at his house . The list goes on and on.Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices , but they 're so out of left field that there 's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience . You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s - themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point ( typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).If you 're looking for something that 'll scare you stay away . If you 're looking , on the other hand , for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever . Watch it.Its been showing on Chiller TV lately ( pretty much every day ) and I 've been watching , earlier out of morbid curiosity , and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day . With Arrested Development and Extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now .	1

"This was the second of two filmed "" Hamlets "" in the nineties , the first being Franco Zeffirelli 's , starring Mel Gibson , from 1990 . Zeffirelli 's version , like Laurence Olivier 's from 1948 , was based upon an abridged version of the play , with much of Shakespeare 's original text being cut . ( I have never seen Tony Richardson 's 1969 version , but as that ran to less than two hours , shorter even than Zeffirelli 's , I presume that was also abridged ) . Kenneth Branagh was attempting something much more ambitious- a film based on the complete text of the play , with a running time of around four hours.With his "" Henry V "" , Branagh claimed Olivier 's crown as the cinema 's leading Shakespearean , confirming his claim with his brilliant "" Much Ado about Nothing "" , a rare example of a great film based on a Shakespeare comedy . "" Hamlet "" was his third Shakespeare film as director ( he also acted as Iago in Oliver Parker 's 1995 "" Othello "" ) and , as one might expect , it is very different to "" Much Ado  . "" . The earlier film , shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside , is a joyous , summertime film about everything that makes life worth living.""Hamlet "" , by contrast is set in the depths of winter . ( The flowers in the description of Ophelia 's death suggest that Shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer ) . The look of the film is particularly striking , both sumptuous and chilly . It was filmed at Blenheim Palace , possibly England 's most grandiose stately home , but also a rather forbidding one . The snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry ; the interior ones formal and elaborate . The action is updated to the mid nineteenth century ; the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era , while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms . ( There is a contrast here with Zeffirelli 's film , where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone ) . The play is dominated by images of corruption and decay ; Branagh 's intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying "" something rotten in the state of Denmark"".The film is notable for the large number of big - name actors , some of them in very minor roles . ( Blink , and you might miss John Gieldgud or Judi Dench ) . Apparently , an all - star cast was required by the production company , who were nervous about a four - hour film . Some of the imported Hollywood stars , such as Robin Williams ' Osric , did not really come off , but others , like Charlton Heston 's Player King or Billy Crystal 's First Gravedigger , played their parts very well . Yorick , normally only seen as a skull , is here seen in flashback , played by the British comedian Ken Dodd . Brian Blessed , who often plays jovial characters , is cast against type as the Ghost , and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening.Of the major characters , perhaps the weakest was Kate Winslet 's Ophelia . Branagh 's leading lady in his first two Shakespeare films was his then wife Emma Thompson , but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995 . I did , however , find myself wishing that Thompson had been cast in the role ; although Winslet came into her own in the Ophelia 's mad scenes , she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane . ( I preferred Helena Bonham Carter in Zeffirelli 's version ) . Richard Briers plays Polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given , a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool . Julie Christie also brings dignity to the role of Gertrude ; there is no attempt here , as there was with Gibson and Glenn Close in the Zeffirelli version , to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and Hamlet . ( An interpretation which owes more to Freud than it does to Shakespeare ) . The age difference between Christie and Branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son , which was certainly not the case with Close and Gibson . ( Olivier 's Gertrude , Eileen Herlie , was , bizarrely , thirteen years younger than him).Branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to "" reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy . "" Much stress is placed upon the war with Norway and the Norwegian Prince Fortinbras- a subplot ignored altogether by Zeffirelli . This emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of Claudius , sometimes played as a one - dimensional villain . There is something about Derek Jacobi 's performance which suggests that Claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances , but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust . He could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother , but chose to rule as a bad king . Although he is tormented by guilt , he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done.Branagh , a wonderfully fluent speaker of Shakespeare 's verse , is superb in the main role . Like Gibson , he has little time for the old concept of Hamlet as indecisive , passive and melancholy . His is an active , physical , energetic Hamlet , something best shown in his fatal duel with Laertes . His guiding principle is not world - weary despair , but an active disgust with evil and corruption.It was a gamble for Branagh to make a four - hour epic , and the film did not do well at the box office . It was , however , praised by many critics , James Berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic . My own opinion is that , whatever the financial returns may have been , Branagh 's gamble paid off in artistic terms . By concentrating on the full text , he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of Shakespeare 's most complex play . When I reviewed his "" Much Ado  "" , I said it was the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare comedy . His "" Hamlet "" may just be the greatest ever film of a Shakespeare tragedy . 10/10"	1
Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book . Wes Anderson directs , and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film . While I respect what Anderson , an incredibly talented man did , the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit . Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man , and if this happened to be a bad film , it would be his first bad film . Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day , this is Anderson 's first bad day in film making , so I am going to let him off easy . I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it , and the animation is nice , but the film gets progressively harder to get into , leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening . The characters are good , also . Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox ( George Clooney ) 's smart ass son , Ash , and especially engaging . The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness , but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along . I 'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film , but for now , I 'm sorry , Wes Anderson , this film of yours was a big disappointment .	0
"The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I 've ever seen . I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase "" guaranteed to offend "" written on it ... meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh.This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits , bad characters , and worse jokes ... from the pathetic Bat - Man sketch to the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit , they just are n't funny . The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin , for example - but even they go on too long and get ruined from Vince Offer 's ineptness at comedy.Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground ... bury it !"	0
This is surely one of the worst films ever made . Each scene is painful . You will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor , the awkward camera work , the sexism and racism , the ridiculous story line , the wooden acting . Poor Joan Bennett ; she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment . In all , dreadful .	0
"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey . One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that "" history repeats itself "" . Life is what it is shown in the movie : when people are young , they seem not to understand their parents , their own spouses ; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world , and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves , so that when life has to end some day , people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life . The actors and actresses are fantastic . They have understood the director 's intention perfectly . The movie 's charm lies in , to me , the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience ."	1
"This was a movie about infidelity and revenge . A twin with the "" twin "" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister . This movie took forever to establish the plot . A plot that has been done many times . The acting was lousy for the most part . Once the plot comes together , the movie ends . Laura and Ashley are twins that live with an abusive father . The father seems to favor Ashley , so Laura gets the blame for everything . There is a promise made that the girls would never be apart , but as they grow up , their lives go in different directions . Ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets Barry , a married man . Of course no good can come of this . The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down . I kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere , but it never happened ."	0

""" Secret of the Lens "" is perhaps a pretty campy all - time favorite of mine . The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki , who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai - ecchi anime .

"Clair Denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers , men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion , heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while Nénette and Boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of Marseilles , our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the French - Swiss border to half way around the world , to Korea and Tahiti . Again the film begins in mid stream , with Louis , in his sixties , coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness . We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence . Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby . Denis is in no hurry to move the action along , and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son , Sidney ( Grégoire Colin , almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache ) who rejects him as a "" lunatic "" : , shown as a dedicated father of two . There are many brief scenes which , while seemingly unrelated , build up an impression of Louis and his milieu . Ms Godard 's camera work is exhilarating here . The controlling metaphor is Louis 's heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to search for another son , not found , and where Louis 's new heart rejects him just as Sidney rejected the old . We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis 's film which are inexplicable : Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon ; a drive by shooting of Boni 's father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head ; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney . The implication , of the last two , is a rejection , real or imagined , by a father , kills something indefinable in a son ."	1
First of all , I have to say I have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something I have n't seen . Taking this into account , I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made , it made me pine for Gigli , My Boss 's Daughter , and any other piece of junk you 've ever seen . BeLyt must be out of his mind , I 've only found one person who liked it and even they could n't tell me what the movie was about . If you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there 's any other way a person could figure this crap out.FOR THE LOVE OF G - D STAY AWAY !	0
Do n't be fooled by the silly title folks , this is one sweet ride ! A true successor to Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer , this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll . It seems that aliens are taking over people 's bodies and modifying them into war - machines , which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species . The winner of the battle eats the loser alive . That 's mostly it for plot , but who cares when the gore is this good ? I have no idea how many buckets of slime were used , but it 's disgusting to behold . There is interesting and effective use of stop - motion when the takeovers are in progress , and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make - up effects . The CGI is a bit limited , but that actually does n't detract from the overall quality one bit , at least for me . This was truly a fun and stomach - turning film that deserves much praise , and has truly earned its place in the stack of Cult Classics . Find it and watch , you wo n't be disappointed !	1
"I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued . A woman , who one day sees herself drive past in her own car . Well , I thought , this could be interesting ...  ... but it is n't . First , the title . The Broken ? The Broken ... what ? What is broken ? The ... oh , wait ... I get it , the title itself is "" broken "" ! WOW , clever ! Unfortunately , this is virtually the only thing going for it.The premise is not that bad , but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in ' Mirrors ' . A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors , and a rather mediocre one at that . A more suited title would be ' The Boring ' , since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages . Or maybe ' The Confusing ' since it does n't explain anything at all , not in the narrative nor in the story itself , only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch , dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death , but nothing tangible . It 's just messed up.On the other hand , the acting and the special effects are quite good , but then again , it 's not a difficult role to act.After watching the movie twice , I still feel unsatisfied , a little confused maybe , and not in the E. A. Poe or Stephen King kind of way . Do yourself a favor , and do n't watch this one . Simply put , there are better thrillers out there ."	0

"I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick "" Snuff "" . I was told that Devil 's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set . I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one , so my interest was peaked.Devil 's Experiment is a short film with no story , no character development . Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes . They torture her in various ways like beating her , spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol , forcing her to listen to hi - pitched noise for 24 hours , smash her hand with a mallet , burning and putting maggots on the burns , throwing guts at her , and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.I must say that a lot of this movie was fake , like the beating scenes . But then , some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it . Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about . The worst is the eye scene . I did n't shutter when watching it but simply thought "" Damn , that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie "" . I did enjoy the flick but I do n't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer . 7/10"	1
"I thought the movie was a poor documentary . Nothing of substance was discussed . It seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new . The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science . Most scientists appeared "" stereotyped "" and sometimes weird . A woman said that her awards did n't matter a whole lot , only children that were helped . She said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards . Playing "" humble scientist "" , are we ? "" I have equations dancing in my head , "" another said . I do n't see how that explains anything to us . It has n't covered significant effects of science on our culture . Politics of science were barely touched.Not a bad flick for a 10 - 14 year - olds . Other than that , I felt it was boring and unrevealing.4/10"	0
Well , I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that do n't reflect my experience at all . To me , Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies . He was a die - hard villain , a no - apologies villain . To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy is n't sort of undercut in some way.The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast . There I think maybe the director could have done better . But , to be honest , the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel . She is an unsung heroine , a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered . But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi 's wife . She may be given little to do , but she does everything with total conviction . I 'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average , you wo n't get much out of this movie .

"This film was terrible . OK , my favourite film is ' The Wicker Man ' ( 1973 ) , so I was always bound to be a little biased . < br />The plot rambles along , throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term ' remake ' highly dubious . ( He 's not a virgin , but IS allergic to bees . WOW ! ) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained , which I 'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make . ( How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film ? ) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout , and his character is prone to calling out "" Rowan ! ? "" at the slightest noise . The ' nods ' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage . For example , certain incidents mirror the original ( The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is searching the island ) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this , I really ca n't be bothered to write any more about this film . It lacks any kind of substance . Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were ' based ' on ( in this case very loosely ) ."	0
Pierce Brosnan the newest but no longer James Bond , is an assassin . He is very very good at what he does , but he 's getting old and tired . Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man . Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives . Then one night they are having drinks in a bar , and they begin to talk . Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events . The story is excellent , the acting is top notch , and the humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this funny , but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see .	1
I read James Hawes book . It was pretty neat , not great , but entertaining enough . Without having read the book I would n't have had the slightest idea what was going on , and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe . Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry . The Mattress sequels came closest , but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry . That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh*t . No , that 's unfair . Let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminium.Plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema .	0
This movie has beautiful scenery . Unfortunately it has no plot . In order to have a plot there must be a conflict . This movie had none . It spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it . The picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling.If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just do n't expect a story . There is n't one .	0
"This movie is cold , bare truth . Often we think "" oh no , that wo n't happen to me . "" But it can . Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly ( or tricked ) into doing things for smugglers . The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them , only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare . People need to know that these sort of events are n't improbable or exaggerated - this IS a major problem in today 's society.I would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie . It is very emotional and raw . Well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory ."	1
Hey guys I 'm actually in this movie ! I did n't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised ! I played Pete , the main characters son . It was a great experience and i loved every minute of it . While filming they needed me to be in two places at once , so they used my twin sister as a body double ! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine . I still act and do some TV , but not as much . Oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.Review : I thought the movie was okay but if i was n't in it , it would n't be one of my favorites . I thought the acting was really good , but the story line was only so - so .	1
"Motocrossed was fun , but it was n't that great . I guess I just did n't understand a lot of the Motocross racing "" lingo "" ( and there was A LOT of that in the film ) ! The plot was n't what I expected from the Disney Channel previews , so that could account for some of my disappointment ."	0
"I think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made , When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of * * * * and it would be best to avoid it , but I somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends , I walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film . The so - called "" jokes "" in this film bring a cringe to the face , they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls , the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies . The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull . The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped . I never want to have to see this * * * * film again , I 'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again . If anyone I see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face"	0
"We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust . Maybe that 's a bit hastey but damn if "" Slaughter High "" was n't terribly unoriginal , even for a slasher flick . Pretty much , the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie - like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former - bullies who all show up to reminisce . As you 'd expect , they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution , burning , hanging , and chemically altered beer . I 've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie , but considering the ending , I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time . Ignore any thought of viewing this movie ..."	0
"I 'm a big fan of Westerns but this one .... whew , what a stinker ! I think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog . I think I could have written better dialog than this when I was in eighth grade . And the poor actors ! Given this terrible dialog , none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous . Really , I 'm not kidding . Some of this is little better than what you 'd get in an Ed Wood film . < br />The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden . He was probably THE "" big "" star in this movie which if you called it a B - Western , you 'd be lavishing praise upon it . This is what should be called a B - minus Western perhaps . Pity Sterling Hayden , who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford , Bette Davis , Frank Sinatra , and other major talents . For him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life.One annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they have n't shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy . I know in the old West guys were n't always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go ' EWWWW ! ' Really , this is a crummy Western . Denver Pyle also had to live this one down , especially after appearances in so many great Westerns . Bad , bad movie ."	0
"I approach films about talking animals with care . For every wonderful one like Babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey . Or in the case of Cats & Dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . When I heard about Paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot did n't exactly fill me with confidence . But I found the film a pleasant surprise . And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.A Russian janitor , Misha Vilyenkov ( Tony Shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . One day , he hears singing coming from the basement . And when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . Misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . And not a few phrases either . Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.The parrot is called Paulie ( voiced by Jay Mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha . Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story . Which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of Marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . The two of them became birds of a feather ( OK , bad pun!).When Marie 's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly . Desperate to be reunited with her , Paulie begins a long journey across America , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . Of a cage that is!Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s . And although it was n't afforded the same recognition or box - office success of Babe , Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.Jay Mohr 's stand - up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie . He never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck . Paulie 's worldly , but he is also naive in his way.Because he 's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie , when he 's taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . And when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie , which he believes . Only for those promises to be broken time and again.Paulie is admittedly a little episodic . It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie . He first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by Ivy ( Gena Rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . She sympathises with Paulie 's situation , and drives an RV across America to find Marie.Paulie is an occasionally very touching film . His scenes with Ivy are some of the best . Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers . The way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought - provoking : < br />""There are things in life you put off , because you think you 're gon na do them later . But the real thing Ivy taught me is you got ta live like there may not be a later . ""The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart - rending moment . And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film 's over.Despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant . The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . And Paulie even gets to have a romance . Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by Mohr as well ) . That may be the only complaint I have . As soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves Paulie on to another.The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . I 'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . And Paulie 's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible . He 's caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he 's remained ever since.The story finally comes full circle at the lab , where Misha vows to help Paulie . Of course they do find Marie . But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , I was left numb for several minutes . Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has , but I believe its an equally brilliant film . The same laughs . The same flawless effects . And the same surprising intelligence.A minor gem ."	1
Ming The Merciless does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul !	0
There 's plenty to appreciate here : spectacular locations and flying sequences ; period costumes , props and sets ; and competent writing and acting . However , to enjoy a drama , we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire . In this bunch of catty snobs , we found only one character who is at all likable  a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim . From the reviews here , it is clear that we are completely out of step , but we did not find their malicious - schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining . Even the dog is detestable . We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes , so you should discount these observations accordingly , but what I could find written about this mini - series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption .	0
In my opinion , this is a pretty good celebrity skit show . I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host . There are many reasons why I said that . Even though Hal Sparks was an okay host , I sometimes wish that Greg Kinnear had n't left . If you ask me , it seems that nobody stays with a TV show throughout its entire run anymore . Still , I enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities . If you ask me , that was pretty darn funny . Before I wrap this up , I must say that I kind of miss this show . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this show to all you die - hard sketch show fans . You will really enjoy it .	1
"I wish more movies were two hours long . On the other hand , I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long . "" Gone with the Wind "" , "" Gettysburg "" - that 's about the length I 've come to expect ; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted ; and even "" Gettysburg "" lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.By contrast Ang Lee 's film is bloated and uneventful . It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours . That was n't a compliment . It 's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation : at the time it feels as though it will never end , afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.The film gets off on the wrong foot , as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage ( bad mistake ) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe . The central two are Jake , the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln , and Jack , an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares . ( I had to re - read that sentence to make sure I had n't written "" Jack "" instead of "" Jake "" at some point or vice versa . ) The two go off to become "" bushwhackers "" - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they ca n't even be bothered to join the official Southern army , which I presume they think is for sissies . I 'm afraid Lee lost me right there . It 's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes : if we have some independent reason to like them , or feel as if we know them in some way , then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more . Not so here . We are n't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour ; when we are , it becomes clear he 's a gormless pimple of a man , who is n't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does , whose psychology is purely immitative . The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way . I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen . I thought : good - kill the rebels , end the damned war , let me go home.Aggravating this problem is the horrible , horrible dialogue . Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent . I 've heard accents from all over the English - speaking world and this is the worst of them all . I do n't care if Southerners really did talk like that , it 's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours . And believe me , we do listen to it for the full two hours : Lee 's picture is a talky one , largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical , say - everything - three - times , folksy drawl . It would help if they talked faster , but not much . Ca n't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?In short : the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life , who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech , who do n't bathe often enough , to whom nothing of interest happens , despite their being involved in a war . Good points ? Jewel was nice to look at , and so was the scenery . But I have complaints even here . The cinematography , nicely framed , looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake ; and as for Jewel , we were teased with her body , but never actually allowed to gaze upon it , which I think is the least we were owed ."	0
OK , I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie . I ca n't recall ever watching one . I also do n't recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie . Alright , I did watch taxi , but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . But , this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing . I do n't know what it is about her , but I just smile the whole time I am watch her . She just captivates me that way . I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates . How sad is that ? This was n't the greatest baseball movie - it was n't supposed to be . It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . It had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .	1
"I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away . The structure and execution of the film was fantastic ... I know it wo n't , but it really deserves an Oscar nod . Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates . Yes , the film is very controversial and I can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it , as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers . However , despite its harsh and blunt subject matter , Zero Day is SO worth watching . I 'm looking forward to it coming out on video so I can buy it - it 's very , very good . Very powerful and intense ... the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it 's almost too realistic . Their uncertainty , the "" recordings "" , the footage and panic of the students , totally indescribable . I really hope it gets the attention it deserves . It 's done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project , handheld camera , made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film - but god is it INFINITELY better . Very impressive , hats off to everyone involved . If you 've got the chance you really should see it ."	1
I considered myself to be quite melancholy , especially when I watch a great touching and tear - jerking movies . But not for this one ( which surprised me ! ) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies : 1 . Despite guilt - ridden Ben 's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past , I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action . Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly , in the end this was a disturbing action to me.2 . The movie story line is over - dramatized , but the logic is over - simplified . Medically , blood type match is required to be an organ donor . Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period . Nevertheless , it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type , same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently , despite the rarity of Ben 's blood type , he was able to donate not only his heart , but also his kidney , his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.3 . Why the doctors allow Ben 's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?I might be over - analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie . However , some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie . If you go for a soap - opera type of film , go for it . But it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment , give this one a miss !	0
"I ca n't believe this is on DVD . Even less it was available at my local video store.Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000 $ budget . I find this funny . I would find it very bad whichever the budget.Still more funny , I read the following in another review : "" Dramatics aside , if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel ( 1971 ) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in , you 'll love this movie . ""What ? ! ? This is a shame comparing those two movies.I give a "" 1 "" , since I ca n't give a "" 0 "" . I just do n't see any way this movie could be entertaining ."	0
"I am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say , "" The book was better . "" I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it was n't a faithful adaptation . There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's / editor's / cinematographer's / producer 's control and certainly out of the original author 's control . Therefore , it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same , word for word , as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride , or whatever ! A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society . Moreover , a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and , if it is based on source material , its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers . < br />Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century , Oil ! , it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the film 's country of origin , the US , was and is experiencing . Even King Kong , based on the original film , benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.With that said , I just do n't understand why they even bothered to make this movie ? Besides the great performances , guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanley 's director / writers fee and royalties he will get , this movie seems to come from nowhere . It should have simply stayed as a play . The movie ( which is essentially the same as the play ) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad . It says nothing new or different than the original play . I ca n't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time : Frost / Nixon , which was also based on a play . Frost / Nixon , while about Nixon 's regrets , seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office . The regrets that Nixon had , as depicted in the play / movie , about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency . In that respect Frost / Nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time . In contrast , Doubt felt like it was yesterday 's news and did n't seem to offer anything that the play did n't offer.Of course the movie is "" good , "" the performances are outstanding , and the screenplay adaptation is apt , but so what ? Why did n't it just stay as a play ? Why , besides marketing and financial reasons , make it into a movie ? It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject ."	0
OK , I kinda like the idea of this movie . I 'm in the age demographic , and I kinda identify with some of the stories . Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi - realistic , and in a different movie would have been forgivable.I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did , but it 's not that easy when the filmmakers were n't trying at all.The editing in this movie is terrible ! Possibly the worst editing I 've ever seen in a movie ! There are things that you do n't have to go to film school to learn , leaning good editing is not one of them , but identifying a bad one is.Also , the shot ... Oh my God the shots , just awful ! I ca n't even go into the details , but we sometimes just see random things popping up , and that , in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also . I 've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity ! Joe , Greta , I do n't know what the heck you were thinking , but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos . You should be ashamed of yourselves ! In conclusion , this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene . If that 's not your kind of thing , avoid this at all cost !	0
"I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category . For the life of me , I can not remember what it was up against , but one thing I can say : It was one of the best movies I have ever seen . And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit.Essentially , it is about a black woman 's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman . There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying , but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with . Along the way , we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption . Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie . Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film . < br />And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely , not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent "" Beloved "" did . I encourage anyone of any race to see this film . 9/10"	1
For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding Franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies / funny situations again and again and again . It is to predictable . It is more done as a TV story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.I like Felix Herngren as Frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it 's audience .... <br / >	0
For anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack , lack of dialogue , clichés up the wazoo , and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an American film , look no farther . DreamWorks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent , or really wanted to create an animated episode of National Geographic ; either way , they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie . Spirit : Stallion of the Cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults , and also fails to entertain despite the oh - so - cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans . After looking past the wonderful animations , what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess.Spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful , as he is a horse that can not be tamed , calmed , nor controlled . Because of this , he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high - spirited horses , which includes his mom . But , his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of Americans in the process of connecting the Wild West with the rest of the country . During this , Spirit ( never actually named that throughout the entire film almost ) befriends a courageous Native American , and a fellow female horse , and also has a lot of run - ins with the cynical and cruel Army folks that apparently do n't believe in giving up.Why must movies mix computer animation with traditional ? It comes off looking rather meshed , something Spirited Away suffered from as well . Best example is when a train is chasing after Spirit ; you see the hand - drawn Spirit running from a computer - animated train . It would look much better if it were one or the other , but not both ; unless you can really pull off some nice effects . Beauty and The Beast 's famous dance sequence uses computer animation , but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie . The opening sequence was the best - looking part of the film , kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality . A little scene has multiple ; I mean multiple similar shots of just a general 's face , quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion.The kids might enjoy this flick , but with lack of dialog , song , and motivation , it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep . While Disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals , they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one . Bryan Adams has no place in this movie , and why does Hans Zimmer stay away from using a Western theme in this movie , when it is a story taking place in the Old West ? Soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me . At least they are using realistic noises of horses , two points for that . Yet , if you are going to refrain from making horses talk , why even have a narrator interrupt every so often , which just so happens to be the main character himself?Native Americans are nice , and the Western folks are evil , Native - killing , horse torturing , rowdy , psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed . More or less , this is what Spirit is showing us . It reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the Wild West ; they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill , and another scene of them destroying an entire village of Natives . Now , the person Spirit befriended happened to betray him , on more than one occasion , yet that is forgivable , apparently because he is not a soldier ; that or because he has the sassy female horse.Spirit is n't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for ; the viewer is supposed to sympathize with Spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk , wreaking havoc , and even perhaps resulting in some off - screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no , Spirit is in trouble ! This film gets quite rhythmic , as we see in multiple instances Spirit escaping from chains , kicking people around , destroying property , freeing horses , and then getting captured again --- all in this same order too . The writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie ; for an Old West film , they certainly have very little room to roam.Bottom Line : This is most certainly no Disney movie , as a matter of fact that is a bad thing , even though it was what they were aiming for . So , instead of the typical musical , we get a boring film that becomes predictable , dull and slow in multiple instances . Even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in . Everything about this movie was just wrong ; from the ideals that back then Americans that were not native were evil buffoons , to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off . Kill Bill Vol . 2 , which pretty much has nothing to do with the Old West , has more of a Western feel than this movie . Do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary . Thank you .	0
"The previous reviewer has said it exactly . I saw it once , was enchanted , saw it a second time when it was re - broadcast within a week or two of the first airing . I still remember some of the scenes . The setting is the opening of the 20th century , the war referred to in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was set in a women - only section of a public place , which was an interesting historical note . The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all - time great movie moments . I do n't think of this as a "" gay movie , "" it 's an interesting and tender period love story , where the two principals happen to be women . I would love to see this movie again ; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD ."	1
"This one is considered a key Pre - Code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY ( 1946 ) , but also the paranoid sci - fi INVASION U.S.A. ( 1952 ) !  and features one of Barbara Stanwyck 's best early roles.She 's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  George Brent , Douglass Dumbrille , Edward van Sloan , Nat Pendleton and John Wayne ( at one point addressing Stanwyck with the titular nickname , derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout ) in the former category and , in the latter , Robert Barrat ( as Stanwyck 's father ) , Donald Cook ( as her most tragic conquest ) , Alphonse Ethier ( as her elderly mentor  more on this later ) , Arthur Hohl ( as a lecherous politician ) and Henry Kolker ( as Cook 's boss and father - in - law , whom Stanwyck also seduces ) . Curiously , scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!Abetted by crackling i.e. typically hard - boiled dialogue and realistic Anton Grot sets , the narrative contains unexpected overtones of Nietzschean philosophy fed to our small - town heroine by the intellectual Ethier ( Stanwyck complains to him early on that she 's no "" ball of fire "" which , of course , contradicts her later comedy  directed by Howard Hawks and co - starring Gary Cooper  of that name ! ) . Under Ethier 's auspices , she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success ; the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she 's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman 's lust for power  in Sergei Eisenstein 's October ( 1927 ) ! Sociologically , it 's also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid / companion.The first two - thirds of the film are simply terrific ; at first , I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly - introduced George Brent character while he ignores her  but , just like the others , he 's soon under her spell ! On second viewing , however , this aspect felt less jarring  as it 's evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused , and that her tenure in Paris has softened her ( even if she tries to cling to her hard - earned wealth for as long as it 's possible).Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION , the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed Pre - Release version and the tamer Theatrical Release print . Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck 's life as a tramp from the age of 14 ( though it 's heard in the accompanying trailer ! ) , while many other scenes have been shortened ( i.e. censored for content ) : the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances ; the seduction at the railroad car ; the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook ; the shooting , followed by a suicide ( only shots are heard in the shorter version ) ; Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing ( again , only Brent appears in the version released to theaters ) , etc . Tha latter , then , utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version ; however , we also get an obviously tacked - on happy ending ( the Pre - Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open - ended note ) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which , basically , has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche !"	1
I was surprised , that ' ' The Secret Fury ' ' was an enjoyable good film ...... Probably because , I did n't have any expectations for this movie ..... Though , the film does have it 's plot holes ..... I would say , that you could n't guess who was behind the whole scheme , until the very end of the movie ..... At first , I thought , it was Robert Ryan , using the same method , like ' ' Gaslight ' ' where husband tries to drive his wife mad , but I was wrong ...... The main problem , with the movie is , they drive at a whole other direction , which gave no clues at the beginning ...... I thought , Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert carried their parts well ...... Plus , Vivian Vance , a fine character actress , who steals scenes in this one ...... Those who like movies , that keeps you guessing , will like this one ......	1
This starts off bad , what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin , endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best ' man ' story , and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert = -= what with Andie 's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 ( she 's the headmistress of an English school , believe it or not ) , only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch - from - hell ' girlfriend ' . .. and then from there , it 's basically unwatchable claptrap : she forgives her ' friend ' and has the organ player 's love child and the 3 women end up as they started , drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah . Andie 's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street , in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth . Have mercy .	0
The original Boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick . It was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind . The third instalment in this series , Return of the Boogeyman , on the other hand , is simply atrocious . It consists of two things . Firstly , cheap and lifeless new footage . Secondly , LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie . The new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way , simply incredibly tedious . This footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort . It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first ( and possibly second ) movies . And boy , do they milk those clips from the earlier films ; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again . The only new addition to these parts is a voice over that pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes . The whole experience of watching this is truly mind - numbing.Return of the Boogeyman is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick ; the kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way . I want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more . There is nothing here of value at all . This is worthless .	0
I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received , but after viewing it I was terribly disappointed . Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd 's brand of humor . The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last . Maybe I missed the point , but if this film is an example of every girl 's growing up experience I am glad to be a man .	0
Will Farmer ( Lanter ) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack , and Ripley , the super government computer , designed to profile potential terrorists , tracks him because Will borrowed ( by hacking ) some money from his next door neighbor 's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia . The next door neighbor whose computer Will was fixing , has relatives in the mid - east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor 's bank , and Ripley sees a terrorist connection . Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes . Oh , oh!This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s . Well , the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days . Makes sense . So the movie dazzles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens , and once Joshua , the forerunner to Ripley , is found operational , we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing , hoping , praying  .sort of , oh - oh - ing , OMG - ing , and more cringing hoping things will go their way . In other words we are now experiencing a made - for - TV type movie , and it 's Oh Hum Time . Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie . It 's much better . < br />But , we really have to ask ourselves : are we making computers too intelligent where one day , in time , they will rule us ? Hmmm  .. < br />Violence : Yes . Sex : No . Nudity : No . Language : No .	0
It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I do n't really like dogs . Fox , Field , and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance , Sassy and Shadow , and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing.I have seen this movie 72 times already ( I know that sounds scary , but it 's true ! ) , and every time the ending scenes still get me . I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers . It is indeed my all - time favorite movie !	1
"Dieter Bohlen , Germany 's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like "" You 're my heart , you 're my soul "" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer . The result was a funny book about his life . Well , more or less a fuzzy image of it . He did n't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself . No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital . However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of "" American Idol "" - especially his unforgettable comments.This should be the end of the story - really . In the hype of the mentioned "" Idol "" TV show called "" Deutschland sucht den Superstar "" ( abbreviated DSDS ) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book . The result is "" Dieter - der Film""I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely . None of the gags really hits the point . Naddel 's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona 's voice should have done that more . Obvious , childish , predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes . The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen 's sloppy idealized memory . They could have used this freedom to do almost everything . It was supposed to be a satire , but they failed . The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.It 's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release . The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success . With the "" friendly "" help of Germany 's biggest yellow press newspaper "" BILD "" and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show "" Wetten dass ... ? "" is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.Therefore : 2/10"	0
This movie is just another average action flick , but it could have been so much better . When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help . Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special . Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie . Then came the final scene , the show - down , the one we had been waiting for , but was like watching something from the A - Team in the 80s . They shoot wildly , nothing hits , and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old , same old .	0
Great little thriller . I was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what I got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time . Mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed . o such foolishness here . Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals . Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled . We saw them so we could just how efficient the Lisa character was and how inefficient the new Hotel clerk was . We see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose . THe Flight Atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead . The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight . The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too . The only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane . THat was clever because I thought they would have something to do with plot . From the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named Lisa is in charge . Even when Jackson shows his true colors she does n't panic . She thinks what she can do to stall time . Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots . But not this one . It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast . Thankfuly none of them were used . The new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do , which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything , or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her . Was Craven should do more of these types of movies . Also one last comment . Brian Cox is in the movie but I had not one clue who he was . I had to come over here to see that he is Lisa 's father . He is completely unrecognizable .	1
This is one strange hacked together film , you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one , I 'm not surprised there 's no credits on it , who would want to be associated with this film . The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over , it all makes very little sense . As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that was n't shot that needed to be , and all the music was very ill - fitting library music ( cheap I guess ) . Very , very odd . I might actually buy a DVD of it though , if it could let me in on what the hell was going on , and what happened to this movie .	0
The thing I remember most about this film is that it used to air on local KTLA TV ( Ch . 5 ) during every Christmas season during the mid to late 70s , mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near Christmas Eve . It was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through , being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle . The graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer . Not quite the kind of Christmas cheer I was used to seeing at the time . Definitely not a Rankin - Bass production .	1
"Admittedly , Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone , although it is a favourite of mine , Knappertsbusch , 1951 , in particular . Syberberg 's entire approach is so static . Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace . The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless . Whatever happened to film editing ? The result is physically exhausting to watch . The viewer is never spiritually transported . Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right , Syberberg got it wrong . And that set decoration with those "" clever "" reminders of Wagner 's anti - Semitism -- will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner ?"	0
I enjoyed every moment of this movie , even though I knew they could never really be together . With the life expectancy of a Bomber pilot being only six weeks , It made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940 's who must have lived this story .	1
"This "" coming of age "" film deals with the experiences of two young girls , Dani and Maureen , as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.Directed by Robert Mulligan , famous for his superb work in "" To Kill a Mockingbird , "" the film never hits a false note . All the acting is superb . As Dani , Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut . Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film , I felt like I was looking through a window to reality , rather than watching a movie.I have watched this movie at least 5 times , and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young , being in love , and going through the feelings , challenges , and changes of young adulthood . Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together , and use it as a discussion piece , as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry , how to deal with being in love , the responsibilities of a parent , etc ."	1
Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year ! The jokes were extremely crude ( was n't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada ) and they were n't funny ! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I did n't even get that . I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance . Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman 's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them . I did n't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director ( Six Days , Seven Nights for example ) This movie was NOT worth the $ 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie . I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over .	0
Found this one in the video store and rented it . It 's one of those quirky , quasi - comedies that 's more interesting and weird than funny . It 's a good one at that . It reminds me a lot of Being John Malkovich . If you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one .	1
"Who is Bettie Page ? I certainly did n't find out while watching this movie . From what I have gathered from other sources , Ms. Page was highly in demand in the post - world war II period as the queen of "" naughty "" pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts . I never did get to know Bettie , the woman , though . Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at . The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film , the "" naughty "" pictures . Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras , Bettie in her girdle and stockings , Bettie in bondage ... etc . The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach . Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go . Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet . When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class . The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Page 's "" naughty "" photos seem in 2007 . It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit would n't even get a hit on My Space or You Tube . I 'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds . I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments ."	0
Only the glandular secretions -- and please do n't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist 's wife fresh and youthful . Since , like most people except those taking part in medical trials , virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly , Dr. Lorenz ( Bela Lugosi ) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved . He 'll do the extracting himself . < br />What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie . If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror , as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste . < br />Sure , the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf ( Angelo Rossitto , who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ) ; his crazed brute of a brother , Angel ( Frank Moran ) , who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins ' hair ; the crazed mother of the two ( Minerva Urecal ) ; the crazed wife ( Elizabeth Russell ) , who sleeps in a plush coffin and , of course , the crazed doctor ( Lugosi ) . < br />An enterprising young reporter , Patricia Hunter ( Luana Walters ) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims . When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night , a raging storm immediately breaks out . That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside . Since it 's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins , Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with . They include dark passages , a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored , a basement mausoleum and , later , a direct threat to Patricia 's own glandular secretions . If she survives , what a story she 'll have to give her editor . < br />If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta ( and why not ? Do n't be superior ) , do n't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here . He had a huge impact in Dracula ( 1931 ) , but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat ( 1934 ) . As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he 's a sad , ironic man protective of his two young friends . When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig ( Boris Karloff ) and begins to flay the man alive , ah , well , it 's a great scene .	0
"Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south . He joins the navy , whereupon he tells his father he will be back . The father gives him an old radio , and Brashear leaves on the navy bus . The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was , "" Never quit "" . After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe ) , who admires his drive and guts , he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne , NJ . He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer , Chief Navy Master Diver , Billy Sunday ( Robert De Niro ) , and from the commanding officer , called pappy , ( Hal Holbrook , who "" has almost as many loose screws as an old car "" . They all want to make him drop out , and the prejudice is quite fierce . The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship . Despite this setback , he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective , and with the help of Billy Sunday , ( now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings ) , they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington , DC to determine if he meets the criteria . An inspirational movie , showing that determination can overcome all odds ."	1
I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise . I left the theater with a smile on my face . One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story -hilarious ! It has some great character actors in it too . Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good . I loved her in Austin Powers . Howard Hesseman is also terrific . I remember him from Head of the Class . I am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made . This is fun and light , and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed . I keep checking to see when it will come out on DVD . I will definitely buy it .	1
ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . Characters ANDY HARDY ( Mickey Rooney ) and JUDGE HARDY ( Lewis Stone ) were going to be front and center . The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner . The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . ANDYs ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY ( 1946 ) his reaction to any ' teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile.In this film it is clearly illustrated . ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . This screen writing device was known as the ' idiot plot ' . A means of stretching a poorly written scenario . Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys ' fault then the Director and the Writers . Most likely George B. Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys ' excesses . To see our overview of the entire series go to YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE ( 1937 ) .	0
I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form . I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho . Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead , and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next - door neighbor . I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection . The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end , the twist you will never see coming . If you like movies like Signs and The Village , the Sentinel will be a classic prelude . Also , what is interesting is the actors in the movie - you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits . The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer . Also there is Beverly D'Angelo , who is underrated but great .	1
"Like many others have commented before me here , I have to say that this movie is bad , but not the worst I 've seen . There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment , because I hate spoilers.I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something , where they had gotten a hold of some extra $ $ $ to spend on CGI ( I 've seen worse of those ) ... All in all , it is quite an insult to the viewer , at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all . There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable , and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through . In addition , there are countless "" easy way out "" scenarios , which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old "" Wargames "" , and I think it 's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.Two stars from me , because of one thing and one thing only : the actors ' performances are n't half - bad , considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with . Still , they should never have signed on to this movie . Not really a career - move , but I guess we all have bills to pay.To those of you who gave this movie top score ... you have to be on the studio 's payroll or something , that 's my only explanation.To all who have n't seen this one : by all means , watch it and make up your own mind . But lower your expectations to the floor ( and then some ) ."	0
"Not even Goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what Gore has done with this complete piece of fiction . This is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say . The "" scientists "" Gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers , psychologists and psychiatrists . Would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro - surgery ? The field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support Gores alarmist claims of global warming . As one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years I have not seen any evidence to support global warming . My analysis of this movie and Gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant . No more , no less . Ask any global warming alarmist or "" journalist "" one simple question- You say global warming is a major problem . Tell me . What temperature is the Earth supposed to be ?"	0
SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I watched half of this movie and I did n't like it . < br />First reason : Boring . Barely anything happens , the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope , they smoke weed , read magazines , care for their sick friend , and cut up the occasional dead body . BORING!!!!Second reason : There are too many things left unexplained . Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men , restrains them in a chair and interrogates them . Who are these men ? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters ? Why does he kill one and let another one go?Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he 's not quite what we originally thought - never explained ! How frustrating is that ? < br />Conclusion : I found the women annoying , the story uninteresting , the duologue tedious , and the action non - existent . Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly is n't . I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website , and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick , I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing .	0
In the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors , given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films , so it 's interesting that this one should star Shirley Temple , who had long since established herself as The Most Famous Child Star of All Time . Then again , she probably was n't the one being tested , I would imagine that would have been Frank Coghlan Jr. , who played Shirley 's brother Sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance . Then again , a 9-year - old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany.The film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling , which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple give a scornful look at the ceiling , illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie , and provide a clean transition into the next scene , which features Shirley gleefully stomping in the rain.It 's Sonny'y birthday , and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog that he really wants for himself , but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since . It 's curious that , when his father insists on getting a dog , Sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house , and as he is running away with no destination in sight , it 's also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today.Sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks ( right after a train flew by which , given how close to the tracks he was , you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks , but no matter ) . After Sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy , he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie . It 's interesting to consider what a longer film would have done , because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end.Not that that matters , Sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it , and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs . It might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs , but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs , but of their lack of power over him . As soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear.Hey , if that 's all it takes , all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I 'm set ! < br />It 's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to , but it 's cute enough and enjoyable enough ( and short enough , as it were ) to still be a fun movie . We already do n't expect an epic plot in a 19-minute film , but Pardon My Pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time . And it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud . I am hardly an expert of Shirley Temple 's films , but it 's not hard to see how she became The Most Famous Child Star of All Time .	1
This film is a great example of fine storytelling . The acting is superb . The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake . There were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were , but considering it is a Hollywood movie , they showed amazing restraint . There was n't a single explosion shown in the movie , even though they had one opportunity to . The film , while having suspenseful parts , was not made into an action movie . The story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times . Well done !	1
Firstly , I have heard great things about this film , not least among the retro / vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love Bettie Page and it did not disappoint . Shot in very clean black and white with colour added for key scenes , the film gives a documentary feel to the early life and career of Bettie Page.There are many things I did not know about Page . Firstly , there was the gang rape , later on , there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures , firstly with a camera club peopled with men who ca n't get enough of her and later with the Klaws , Paula and Irving , who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos , come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people . If only modern pornography producers were like that , perhaps better porn would be a consequence ! For the most part , the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women . This environment was extremely repressive , perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the ' saturation ' effect that we have today , when it comes to pornography . It also appeared to be much less harsh . Page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and does n't appear to be degraded by it . In many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged ( and trying to hold a conversation ) , brandishing a whip with a flourish , thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seen in ' initiation style ' girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now.Page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirties for ' Jesus Christ ' . Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away , even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been given a ' gift ' by God to do ' this thing ' . Seeing this film , I am more knowledgeable about Page and in awe at her modesty , beliefs and demeanour . She is one of a kind , compared with the identi - kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actually say ' There is life after porn ' .	1
It has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick . I have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by Gautham . From my perspective , I feel this movie is virtually flawless . Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - no doubt .. classy . Jyothika played her role as Maya very well . The character suits her very well . The character that caught movie - goers attention was Pandia . Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well . Brutal and fearsome . Jeevan deservedly received the Best Villain award in the ITFA 2004.The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji , Devadharshini and other performed well.Racy screenplay , perfectly - timed dialogues and brilliant narration by Gautham . The soundtrack by Harris Jeyaraj are all chart - busters while the BGM suits the movie very well . Cinematography by R.D. Rajasekhar is rich . Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well . Anthony 's editing is precise . Above all , Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance.Even some Hollywood film ca nt compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... undoubtedly .	1
"Do you like stand up ? Then stay away from this ... During the early rounds , there are in fact good comics , but unless they got some cute qualities , they got a snowballs chance . Any controversial material and you are OUT ! ... and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians , when I see who the crooked judges are letting in.1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries . Half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs . Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere , something the judges does n't seem to have problems with.It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV , but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.If the producers changed the name of the contest to "" Last Clown Standing "" , all my criticism would loose validity . Maybe an idea ?"	0
"Yeah , that about sums it up . This movie was horrifying . Two minutes in I wanted to gouge my eyes out . This has been praised as an "" innovative LDS comedy , "" but it 's not even good for members of that church ! I do n't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality.First of all , you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie . It seems as if the horribly drab , glib , trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent ( at least semi - coherent ) thought . Then , there 's the acting , which is dismal from * everybody * involved . Even the cameos fail to liven anything up.And let 's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change , but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue , appallingly hideous "" gags , "" and a lot of Mormon "" in - jokes "" that anyone in their right mind , LDS or not , should consider purely * stupid * ! This has to be one of the worst films I 've ever seen !"	0
"Man , this is a hard DVD to come by . I could only find it on Region 2 , a Spanish import , and it was expensive.Was it worth it ? Well , yes . Not so much because it 's a masterpiece of film making , though directed by Curt Siodmak ( the credits on IMDb.com read "" Robert "" but the DVD credits list Curt ) , or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook , Jr. , and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade - long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.Essentially , a respected but self - contained engineer ( Alan Curtis ) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket . A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review . She accepts , a little gloomily . The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.At the show , the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger . The drummer in the band , Cook , leers at the silent lady but gets no response . Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she wo n't give it , and she does n't want to know his . If she 'd been a Longfellow devotee she 'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.Okay , Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence . The head police officer , Gomez , turns him over to the DA . His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender , not the Latina star , not the cab driver ( "" Al Alp "" ) , not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared , it 's impossible to dig her up.Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die . But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her 's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story . He joins Curtis 's loving secretary , Ella Raines , in re - investigating the case informally.They visit the supposed witnesses again . The ominous bartender is run over by a car , perhaps accidentally , so he 's out of the picture . The hot - tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she 's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway . Elisha Cook , Jr. , is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group . His sweaty face assumes an expression which does n't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous , orgasmic insanity . His eyeballs roll to the ceiling , his mouth gapes , his hammering becomes frenzied . I laughed out loud.Nobody 's performance is otherwise outstanding , but all are professional enough . Thomas Gomez is always reliable . Best performance , though , is probably by Franchot Tone . He 's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi . He 's reserved and artistic . Even when he faints he 's decorous . I do n't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part . Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture . < br />I do n't know why it 's considered as classic . It 's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich , not as good as some of his others . But Siodmak 's direction is sensitive . A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it . His use of shadows is quietly effective.Glad I got it ."	1
"It 's hard to say which comes out on top , James Cagney 's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of Busby Berkeley 's three grand showstoppers at the close . I give it a tie , with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals . Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney , Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the good - natured story line . < br />And what 's the story line ? It 's about Chester Kent ( Cagney ) who produces musicals , and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over . He starts doing Prologues , live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts . He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them , moving them around the country . He 's a ball of fire and ideas , and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things . But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas ; Nan Prescott ( Blondell ) , his wise - cracking secretary , loves him but he 's too busy too notice ; an office girl in black - rimmed , round glasses ( Ruby Keeler ) wants a chance to dance ; his wife turns up saying she did n't divorce him after all ; a blonde gold - digger is setting her hooks in him ; his partners are cheating him ... my gosh , what 's next ? This may all sound like a lot to digest , but everything happens fast , with Cagney bouncing , strutting , striding , finger - snapping , barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it 's done . < br />Instead of "" Let 's put on a show , gang "" we have "" We need to build three shows in three days , so lock the doors and let 's start rehearsing . "" These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines , spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract , with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses ... the whole Apollo movie house circuit ! Exhaustion threatens , feet ache , but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes ( which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour ; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic ) stay the course , dancing their hearts out , giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty . < br />And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses , one after the other on the same night , with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he 'll save Chester 's skin or not . < br />First up is "" Honeymoon Hotel "" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness , with brides and grooms ( some might even be married ) , bedrooms and beds , and doors with "" Do not disturb "" signs . < br />Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of "" By a Waterfall "" that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy . This number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls , trees , fountains , a huge grotto with waterslides , a giant pool -- you 'd never think there was a Depression on . Berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization , human patterns , legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water , with a lot of underwater photography looking up . The girls are sure game . They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks . The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting . Ruby Keeler , who has a couple of quick shots in the water , is the only one who looks a bit cautious . < br />And finally , the smash finale ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to "" Shanghai Lil , "" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers , unusual in that the races are mixed up . There 's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar , dancing on a table , Cagney fighting . There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines , hupping back and forth , rifles tossed and caught . Then ... this is true ... a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle . This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt , a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes . < br />That 's entertainment , folks . It 's great ! < br />Of course , Chester 's Prologues get the big contract and Nan gets Chester . The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile . Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along . Joan Blondell makes us forget about a lot of Hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality . The movie , however , belongs to Cagney , who grabs and shakes it , and to Berkeley , a man for whom too much was never too much ."	1
"I just saw this film on Turner Classic Movies last night and was blown away by Victor McLaglen 's performance : In every sense of the word a "" tour de force "" . The atmosphere of 1922 Dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40 's and early 50's . Very nice attention to detail also;during Frankie McPhillip 's ( Wallace Ford 's ) wake , the mourners are all praying in Gaelic . Max Steiner 's score is unforgettable . As in later films such as 1939 's GWTW , he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time . John Ford : already a film giant in 1935 !"	1
Shot into car from through the windscreen , someone is playing someone else their latest song , someone else did n't react , according to the voice - over . I just wonder how that came to be made . There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there . If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post - party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max , if not , then it was a total fabrication , either way it made me uncomfortable , if that was the purpose ? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about . Taken at face value , a nice portrait of the ( tortured ) genius we all believe ourselves to be .	1
Not since Spongebob Squarepants have i seen a greater cartoon on TV . The colors are great , the voices could't be better , the characters are so original , great great cartoon . Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon . Hope the Season DVD comes out soon ! ! ! I love cartoons like this and I hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon . It is very hard to find the Season DVD , so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me Know . The only Catscratch merchandise available on Nick Shop is a great lookin shirt , but very very very expensive ! ! ! If you love Spongebob ; and who doesn''t ? ; you 'll love Catscratch too !	1
Not sure why this film was advertised as a wild , quirky , laugh filled comedy . There is not much in this movie that will entertain , nor amuse the moviegoer . Annette Bening ( whose acting was touted as being Oscar worthy ) comes off here as mannered , with her performance seeming routine . Brian Cox 's character is confusing and irritating , and the lead playing Augusten  Joseph Cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role . The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood , but she is not enough to endorse this boring , unsavory film.The film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason . I found some of the scenes distasteful ( the scene with Brian Cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in ' You and Me and Everyone We Know ' and ' The Squid and the Whale ' ) , some embarrassing , and most of them unsettling . I found the whole experience a waste of time . Do n't you waste your time 	0
""" Ice Age "" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company 's first . We are introduced to the main characters : a squirrel named Scrat ( voiced by Chris Wedge , AND PLEASE NOTE : the sound of Scrat 's screams is the sound of Tom 's screams from the "" Tom and Jerry "" cartoons ) , a woolly mammoth named Manny ( voiced by Ray Romano of "" Everybody Loves Raymond "" ) , a sloth named Sid ( voiced by John Leguizamo of "" Titan A. E. "" ) , and a saber toothed tiger named Diego ( voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar 's "" A Bug 's Life"").The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that , he caused an avalanche . We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age ( except for Manny , who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him ) . Sid comes out of his cave yawning , and saw that his family abandoned him . He then pays toll with some aardvarks . Unfortunately , he gets pursued by Sylvia ( voiced by Kirsten Johnston of "" 3rd Rock from the Sun "" ) , a female orange sloth , who wants Sid to go migrating with her . Sid eventually teams up with Manny , and they became friends.Meanwhile , nearby a human tribe , Soto ( voiced by Goran Visnjic ) , an evil saber toothed tiger , wants revenge against the tribe 's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son , Roshan , away from him . In the morning , he , Diego , and Soto 's henchmen , Lenny ( voiced by Alan Tudyk ) , Oscar ( voiced by Diedrich Bader ) , and Zeke ( voiced by Jack Black ) attacked the tribe , but the leader 's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after . Eventually , Diego joins them , and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe , who are also looking for him as well . Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out , okay ? Besides Manny , Sid , Diego , Scrat , Sylvia , and Roshan , the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan 's tribe are using , and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer ( voiced by Jane Krakowski ) , and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel ( voiced by Lorri Bagley ) , to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit . Incidentally , the two rhinos , Carl ( voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI 's "" Madagascar "" ) , and Frank ( voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar 's "" Finding Nemo "" ) , who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff , are simple minor characters . Same went for the dodos , who are using melons as their food supply.The gags in this movie are very funny . For instance , Manny talks through his trunk saying , "" I'M NOT GOING ! "" When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit , Sid asks Jennifer "" What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ? "" Jennifer then responds to him , "" What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT ! ? "" Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist . Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth , then she asks Sid if he 's holding his breath , tells Diego to eat him , and promptly walks off.Since "" Ice Age "" is not only a success , but it has 2 sequels : the first one was "" Ice Age : The Meltdown "" , which was released in 2006 , and the other was "" Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs "" , which is going to be releasing next year . I can hardly die waiting to see what "" Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs "" will be like ."	1
"What a class bit of British cinema ! It 's about time . And a side splitting comedy to boot!Anyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticket.It 's a mix between "" Withnail and I "" and "" Easy Rider "" . The movie runs at a solid pace and does n't let you drift off for too long ... At times there are reflective moments , but I think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying . I was a little concerned with Phil Daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie ! Generally I found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me . Oh well.I would thoroughly recommend it . This will become a cult British comedy . Well worth a visit ."	1
"I can see why this film was Oscar - nominated for Best Live Action Short , as it was constructed masterfully . Even if you do n't particularly like the Blues ( though to me , this sounded much more like jazz ) , you can easily appreciate this film . It is simply very well made , though for the life of me , I ca n't see why director Gjon Mili only got to direct one film -- this one . In other words , the film is nominated and yet the director did n't get any sort of career boost . As for the black performers , I could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear , as unfortunately most of white society have indifference ( or worse ) for blacks or "" that kind of music"".If you do watch this film , if you are n't particularly enjoying the earlier portion , skip ahead to about the 5:50 mark -- where it picks up considerably . When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise , the pace improved quite a bit ."	1
"I loved this movie . The scenery was breathtaking , the plot had some nice twists and turns , and the characters were well rounded . On two fronts , however , "" Rob Roy "" scored far above average . First , I have rarely seen a "" popular "" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high . There were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay . I could give numerous examples , but why should I ? Just watch the film . Second , this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more . For a drama to succeed , it needs not only a hero , but a really believable villain . If you do n't have one , there 's not much joy in rooting for the good guys . And "" Rob Roy "" has not one , but three -- the Earl of Montrose , his henchman Kilairn , and Archie . Not one - dimensional villains , either , but fully fleshed and very nasty . It takes a bit more patience than "" Braveheart""--there 's more dialogue , and the accents are a bit tough , but it 's a much more clever and subtle piece . ( As I said , I loved this movie ! )"	1
"I agree with "" Jerry . "" It 's a very underrated space movie ( of course , how many good low - budget ones AREN'T underrated ? ) If I remember correctly , the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation ( but not "" rip - off "" ) of 2001 , because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man , who had somehow been turned into a computer . And like HAL , they tried to disconnect his "" mind "" , but not the mechanical parts of him , and as with HAL , it led to disaster . There is at least one funny moment . When the Christopher Cary character , who ca n't find any food , finds the abandoned pet bird , there 's a kind of ominous moment , but then the obvious thing does n't happen after all ."	1
I actually saw this movie in the theater back in it 's original release . It was painful to watch Peter Sellers embarrass himself so badly . The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow , and the ending was ridiculous . It was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen . I wo n't say that I 'm a huge Peter Sellers fan , but I did thoroughly enjoy the Pink Panther series and I felt that he gave a strong performance in Being There . But this film should never have been made . From what I 've read , he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him . Fine , but that still does n't excuse the studio actually releasing the film .	0
"I must tell you right up front , I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful . However , if you 've never seen one , DON'T start with this one ! I have greatly enjoyed the ones I 've seen up until this one , but I just could n't stand this one . I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film -- it was that annoying . So why was it so annoying ? < br />1 . There is a character named ' Rambha ' in the film . He is even more annoying than Jar - Jar Binks -- which I never would have believed would have been possible . He is so # @^ ! # annoying ! ! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief . Instead , he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die ... slowly ! His voice , his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness -- he just did n't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in -- and he needed to die ! < br />2 . The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease . I kid you not -- there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles ! ! And , again and again , they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians ! ! ! This made Stallone 's actions in "" Rambo II "" look mundane ! ! < br />3 . The film was so gosh - darn loud , in your face and intense -- it practically made my brain bleed ! ! It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth ! ! Crazy camera angles , INTENSE music and action , action , action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who ca n't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100 % action.4 . The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense ... none whatsoever ! < br />Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film , but as for me I can see why it 's on IMDb 's infamous Bottom 100 list . Wow ... this film is bad AND intensely bad ! !"	0
I saw a lot films about Charles Dickens ' Christmas Carol . But this one is the best of all ! There is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book . The actors ( George C. Scott and others ) are great ! Unfortunately , you ca n't often watch the film in Germany and Switzerland .	1
"First of all , let 's get a few things straight here : a ) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact ( I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool ) . b ) I DO like several B - Movies because they 're hilarious . c ) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.Moving on , when the movie first comes on , it seems like it 's going to be your usual B - movie , down to the crappy FX , but all a sudden- BOOM ! the anime comes on ! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.The animation is VERY bad & cheap , even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER , for crissakes ! In fact , it 's so cheap , one of the few scenes from the movie I "" vividly "" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school ... & it 's the same kids over & over again ! The FX are terrible , too ; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla . In addition , the transition to live action to animation is unorganized , the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed ) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player ; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel / Mike on MST3 K ( you pick the season ) . Honestly , this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.Heck , I 'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B - Movie night . Because it 's stupid , pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time , I 'm giving this movie a 3/10 , an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.(According to my grading scale : 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad . As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it , then it will become as fun as counting to 15 . )"	0
"The movie may be great . I just watched it last night , but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because I read the book first . The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the film . If you plan to watch "" Of Human Bondage , "" do n't read the book beforehand . On the other hand , the book is so good , and contains so much more than the love affair Phillip has with Mildred , you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie . I do not make this claim lightly . I average reading a book every 4 days , and read such disparate authors as Danielle Steel , Ovid , Faulkner , Plato , and Shakespeare . "" Of Human Bondage "" gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written ."	1
"This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly is n't that great . Sure , "" CHAOS "" and "" INSIDE MAN "" are literally the same movie , just with variations in suspense . But I found "" CHAOS "" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film "" Swordfish . "" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and "" Chaos "" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters , but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. < br />It 's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films , but that does n't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch . < br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V. , but you 'll probably get bored with after awhile ."	0
This is a movie that plays to everyone 's emotions . We all want a second chance at things . Jim Morris got one , followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream . What a great message and what a great delivery by this movie .	1
After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes . Though i guess not . If the first one was n't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch . With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever . Though they could n't , they had to take all the same raunchy , not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again . Though the thing is i did n't laugh at it the first time . They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level . Most of the time it 's just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it 's hard to watch it and enjoy it . Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene . Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into the age range that it 's supposed to be funny for . While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do find this funny then you probably are n't one of the more mature or intelligent people around . It does n't take that much skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs . It 's a movie parody that 's actually good and well done and it did n't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either .	0
""" Addictive "" is an adjective I 've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows . Most recently , dramas like Lost , Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description . However , as compelling as they may be ( and they really are ) I can wait a few days before I see the next episode of either series , even Prison Break which some have lazily classified as "" the new 24 "" . With all due respect , there can be no such thing , and for a good reason : no other silver - screen thriller is based on a real - time structure . That 's what sets 24 apart from any other show , and that 's why I practically have to watch an entire season ( on DVD ) in seven days or less : once the frickin ' clock starts ticking , it 's impossible to tune out.An episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of NYPD Blue ( and , more recently , Deadwood ) ; having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours , one per ep ( the actual running time is 41 minutes ; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly ) , was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since Hill Street Blues introduced non - linear storytelling ( a mandatory element nowadays ) . And it truly paid off.Ironically enough , the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding ( fortunately , creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller ) , which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere : looking extremely relaxed , Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter Kimberly ( Elisha Cuthbert ) and , minutes later , being tender with Teri ( Leslie Hope ) , the wife with whom he has just reconciled . As in The Sopranos , though , something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner : not only has Kim snuck out of her room , Jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately . At midnight ? I 'm afraid so : Bauer is a CTU ( Counter Terrorist Unit ) agent , and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of David Palmer ( Dennis Haysbert ) , an African - American Presidential candidate who will be in Los Angeles for the whole day ( oh , right , I almost forgot : events occur on the day of the California Presidential Primary ) . No time for napping , then : Jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case . Unfortunately , he has a tendency to ignore protocol , and that does n't sit well with George Mason ( Xander Berkeley ) , a slimy man from Division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.The plot is very dense , making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span , but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly : the writing is sharp and precise , the attention to detail unsurpassed , and the suspense is consistently sky - high , mainly thanks to the real - time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.Another great quality of this pilot is the characterization : most genre shows ( sci - fi and thriller ) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on ( a textbook example is CSI , where character development is minimal , but then again that matches the show 's unique style ) , whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people , among whom Jack ( Sutherland 's best role - ever ! ) and Palmer ( the real revelation of the show ) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only ( the former divided between job and family , reckless but humane , the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity ) . A couple of supporting parts border on stereotype ( Mason and Tony Almeida especially ) , but two factors ought to be taken into account : a ) this is the first episode ; b ) there 's so much going on most viewers wo n't even complain about a "" flaw "" or two . After all , how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy , a missing teenager AND a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?Tick , tock , tick , tock ..."	1
"Imagine the plight of Richard , a painter , whose real passion is flying . When we first meet him , he is seen atop a building in London wearing his home made wings . He has ripped his canvases and other works , at the height of his despair , and fashions a flying device for his jump . When he falls into the protective police contraption , he does n't suffer a scratch , but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service . Richard , whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly , decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane.Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly . She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S. , or Lou Gehrig 's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair . Jane is extremely intelligent , but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary . She uses a hand held device to speak sometimes , as her speech is not clear . What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity , at any cost . Jane and Richard clash as they meet , but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another.Jane , who watches porn on her computer , has a notion for finding someone like Richard Gere in "" American Gigolo "" , who will , for a fee , have sex with her . When Richard takes her to London , they find the right man for the job . His fee is exorbitant , but they agree . Since they have no money , Richard decides to rob a big bank . Unfortunately , things do n't go according to plan when Jane realizes that she ca n't go through with what she had wanted . At the end , Richard takes Jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life , something that brings them closer , as they find an affinity with one another.Peter Greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation . Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films , and yet , she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish . Mr. Greengrass shows an affinity Richar Hawkins ' material he wrote for the film . The movie does n't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease.Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching the film . She makes a wonderful Jane . On the other hand , Kenneth Branagh does n't seem too well suited for this type of comedy . Somehow , he has problems of his own in the way he interprets Richard . Gemma Jones has some good moments as Anne , Richard 's former love.""The Theory of Flight "" shows a good director . No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things ."	1
"Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra , Kathryn Grayson , and Jose Iturbi star in "" Anchors Aweigh , "" directed by George Sidney.Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence , two navy guys on leave in Hollywood . They meet a little boy ( Dean Stockwell ) and on taking him home , they meet his aunt ( Grayson ) . Clarence falls for her . She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi . They try to help , but there 's a mix - up.This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra . Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence . Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings . Not one of my favorite voices , but she does well . Iturbi 's piano work is beautiful.Sinatra gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him , with those big blue eyes and boyish face . For Kelly , this was a major break for him at MGM.Wonderful movie , very buoyant ."	1
This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics . The script is ludicrous , the acting is over - the - top , and it looks cheesy . The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari . Watching the actress , who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released , has the same fascination as watching a train wreck . Her ex - husband , Amrohi , wrote and directed , but lacks the competency to execute either task well . Bollywood has produced far better films .	0
"I think scarecrows are creepy , so it 's a pity this movie does n't make more of them . < br />A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows . One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows . The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive ( when they move ) . On the positive side , the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows . It is as Alfred Hitchcock says , "" A bomb under a table goes off , and that 's surprise . We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off , and that 's suspense . """	0
"Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother , could possibly be good cinema ? I certainly did n't . I thought I knew what to expect : one of the most boring experiences of my life . Well I was as wrong as I have n't been wrong too often yet , because this is one of the best , most realistic and honest Hollywood films I 've ever seen ... Giving a short resume of "" The Straight Story "" is n't very difficult . It 's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke . That 's already special on itself , but what makes it even more special is the fact that he has n't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument . In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems , but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life . Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks , not knowing if he will reach his goal : seeing his brother again before it 's too late ... I can easily understand why there are people who do n't like this movie and that 's also the reason why I will not say that these people do n't have a heart or things like that ... This movie has n't got any flashy action scenes , it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no , you do n't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either , because there is n't any . But why should you watch it then ? Well , the simple answer is the story . I have n't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio 's ( that 's right , the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense ) makes it even more special . I 'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it , probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow , but I really do n't agree with that . Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and do n't want to think any further . If you look close enough than you 'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong , that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too , so they wo n't make the same mistake . If that is n't deep enough , how much deeper does a story have to go for you then ? < br />I would also like to add that this movie really had it all . Some beautiful landscapes ( finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York , Chicago or some other big city ) , some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth , Sissy Spacek , ... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie . I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie would n't be to my taste . It 's one of the very best movies I 've seen in a long time . This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull 's eye . I give it the full 10/10 ."	1
"Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like "" Chances Are , "" but I was n't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons . The first half was pretty well done overall , with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body ( played by Robert Downey Jr. ) . He meets up with his wife ( Cybill Shepherd ) and friend ( Ryan O'Neal ) and his daughter , who is now grown up . The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done , and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated , but from there the film goes downhill . There are several sex - related scenes that turned me off completely , especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now . After that , however , the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible , considering the circumstances of the plot . I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end . There was great potential with this story , and the scenes in heaven are well done . There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher , but ultimately the film is not great . For a better , similar film , try "" Heaven Can Wait . "" Decent , but I really kind of wish I had n't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.<br / > * * * out of * * * *"	1
"I bought this ( it was only $ 3 , ok ? ) under the title "" Grey Matter "" . The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non - DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me . As the other reviewers warned , it 's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.And yes , there are plenty of establishing shots , especially of a house with a pool in front of it . Some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript I guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who , so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings . It 's actually kinda funny . After awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel 's station identification logo , reminding us that we are watching "" Grey Matter"".I also enjoyed two bouts of name - calling . At one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a "" Scientific b*tch ! "" . It 's just a very inadequate insult . Several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that "" scientific b**tard ! "" . It just sounded very awkward to me.Someday this movie will disappear forever . Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it . Almost like it never happened.<br / >"	0
Although this seems to be quite an old show ( 2002 ) , I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show . . . ever.I am not one for placing comments but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to , and I am only assuming that this was their target audience , children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQ.The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines , tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship , family , religion and politics ! ! ! .Basic story that they covered in the episode : Frat House hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death Turns out to be Senators son who wants FBI to investigate . Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said ' no ' to mean mulit millionaire . Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ( ex - girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie , disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience , Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son , he gives money freely to lots of broke students ) . All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is ' at that age ' and has a crush on a boy , who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty , but only to dump him because the ' in ' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him . Do n't worry , she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the ' in ' girls drop her , Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on ( I was almost sick at this point).This ' drama ' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is . . . your gon na laugh at this , i sure did . . . < br />It is one of the Frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an International terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral . . . . . . . < br />The characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard Anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain < br />Why the writers of this show have tried to pack in EVERY eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line . Watching this show is like watching ' Last Action Hero ' with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a tooth pick , except Arnie is a better actor ( wow , never thought there would be a day that i would say that ! ! ) < br />In the words of the Simpsons beloved character ' comic book guy ' . . . . < br />WORST TV SHOW . . . . .

"OK ... this one 's a weirdy .... Honestly , I ca n't tell you all the inner plot - points of THE BEAST , cuz I started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait , it definitely does "" pick up"" ... The plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some French aristocrat chick screwed back in the day . Eventually you see "" THE BEAST "" , which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat - bear costume with a horse cock attached to it . The scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep . The sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared . THE BEAST pops up , rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her . Eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast 's "" attention "" which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes , including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere ( yeah , I 've got a twisted foot - fetish - so sue me .... ) ... The whole film is told in flashbacks and long - winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious . A "" shocking "" but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film ... THE BEAST is a film that I find kind of hard to rate . The cinematography itself is quite eye - catching and the sets , costumes and locations are elaborate . The plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat - bear . A good bit of tits , ass , and hairy 70 's French bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film . I have to honestly say , that if it were n't for the graphic scenes of the BEAST spackling all over the willing maiden , this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex ( the beginning has a VERY up - close and personal scene of two horses boning , including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina ... YUM ! ! ! ) . But the BEAST sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film , that I have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer . I have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they 've seen it all - the BEAST rape really is out - there and something to be witnessed . Also recommended to any fans of 70's/80 's sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them . Worth a look for you sick rat - bear beastiality lovers out there ( like me) ... 8/10"	1
"Of all the kung - fu films made through the 70 's and 80 's this is one that has developed a real cult following . With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story . An aging kung - fu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh ( Sheng Chiang ) about five pupils he has trained in the past . All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently . Their specialty in kung - fu is the name they have adopted like Lizard , Snake , Centipede , Toad and Scorpion . The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil . An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target . Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are . Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung ( Pai Wei ) and along with Tang Sen Kue ( Feng Lu ) who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map . A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is . A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin ( Philip Kwok ) investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow ( Chien Sun ) . Sin has a friend called Li Ho ( Meng Lo ) who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity . The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed . When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue . < br />This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films . Chang was not your run of the mill kung - fu director and his films always had a special quality to them . While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme . Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that . Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks . Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is . Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves . I would n't exactly put it in the same league as "" Enter The Dragon "" because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking . This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film is n't necessarily about fight scenes . Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved . That alone makes this different from all the other kung - fu films . Very well made with a unique story ."	1

- A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband 's dead former wife . It 's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone does n't want her in the house . She sees skulls all around the house . But when the husband investigates , he ca n't find anything . Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from ? Or , is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house ? < br />- This is the first time that I 've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3 K crew . And , it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way . Can you say dull ? I 'm not talking ordinary dull - I 'm talking watching grass grow dull . There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens . The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment out of it . The characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable . The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.- The actors do n't help matters much . Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play . I have n't looked it up , but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value . I wo n't even go into the script the actors are given to work with . Let 's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film.- You 've been warned ! Either avoid this one at all costs or , at least , seek out the MST3 K version .	0
I have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago , and to this day I have always told people it is probably the best film I have ever seen . Considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and I even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound . I would highly recomend this film , I wish it was available on DVD .	1
Flat , soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film . Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise , you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in , which are always at the wrong time.The main character , Spirit the horse , is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening . The narration is not needed , though , as everything happening is really obvious . You can even tell what the horses are saying , although all they do is neigh . Which would be good , but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning , one for sorrow , one for laughing , etc . There is no variation between the horses ' voices.Young kids might like this film , though . It 's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch , and there 's little danger of anyone being frightened . If you have nothing else to do , and want to watch a film with your kids , this is n't a bad choice.But otherwise , this is n't recommended .	0
A must see for anyone who loves photography . stunning and breathtaking , leaves you in ore . seen it twice once in a cinema and now on DVD . it holds up well on DVD but on the big screen this was something else.Took my two daughters to see this and they loved it , my oldest cried at the end.but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop . its simple telling of a child 's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well . in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate . which works for children very well . not being preached to is very important , you make your own mind up.But the star of this film is the cinematographers , how did they do what they did . amazing just amazing .	1
"This movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological . I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater , their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes -- eyes wandering at their neighbor , wondering if it was just them . I mean , how could the movie really be bad . Nobody'll admit it , it 's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes . "" Who am I to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner ? "" But the fact remains , every member of the audience is thinking what I 'm writing right now . I actually plagiarized their faces.Obviously Lois is only aroused by power , she wo n't even have a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses who does n't stop jet liners . It ca n't be the look in "" his "" eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that . In the old Supermans , she had some level of connection with him , he was n't priority number 1 , obviously , but it strengthened her character that she was "" torn "" . I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois over before Clark Kent.And now it 's official , Kryptonite does to Superman what eating at McDonalds does to the avg . person.SUPERMAN "" ONE "" He loses his earth dad , then finds his real super dad , the story is captivating every step of the way . He 's human , he relates to people and he feels love for people , he relates to highschool students , he relates to people who feel different . He relates . The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to Superpeople and it seems he 's just "" doing a job "" when he 's saving people.There 's something about Clark that Lois likes , she 's really internally in love with him but ca n't admit it , and when he comes into the picture as Superman , it throws a kink in the on - the - rocks love . Without Superman , she would 've fallen in love with Clark ( at least that 's what the movie points to , whether it was the intention or not ) . Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN , Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois . Literally.SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again . As a kid , I "" thought "" I enjoyed the action , but now I know it was the STORY that held me then too , watching it over and over again . If I saw Superman Returns as a child , I would 've hated it then too , I think.There is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie , it 's sick . Superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile , MEANWHILE , Lex Luther 's got something fantastic up his sleeve.SUPERMAN THREE Now there 's a three - way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark , only humanity wins and Clark 's inner nature beats Superman 's power , because when his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he 's SuperHUMAN ( who does human things with his superpowers ) , she sees it 's not the power of Superman that she 's in love with , it 's not SUPERpowerman , but SUPERMORTALman that she loves -- and who 's really SUPER . And when she tells Clark she "" prefers "" him to Superman , he is elated , he has made a human connection again . He wants to be accepted for who he is , not just for his ability to bend steel . THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT 'S MISSING FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS.Clark super - sneezes to help the kid get a strike - humanity again . Plus , it 's an INERESTING use of superpowers . He 's not just using straight brute strength.He crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers , love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving.It seems there 's nothing at stake in Superman Returns . Even in Superman Three , we see the damages caused by the nemesis ' world domination plot .. we see suffering , we see how it effects Pryor and others and people in the middle of it .. there 's no damage , esp . emotional from Lex 's plot to sink the US . We see a glob of crystal thrown into space .. Superman had to get very creative in the first three Supermans in order to stop the plot against him , he could n't just "" access "" his superpowers . In the first one , he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save Lois ' life ... ( this was THIRTY YEARS AGO ! ! "" ) In the second one , he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than , but combined with Lex 's genius , and the villains ' immoral tactics , Superman 's overpowering was n't enough , he had to work one against the other and outsmart them ... In Superman III , again , his superpowers were n't enough to win .. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw . He could n't use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance , so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression . And he found that acid earlier when he could n't simply use his superpowers to BLOW out a fire because it was a chemical fire , so he had to use his superbrains -- he could n't carry water , so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire .. Now in Superman Returns , he simply lunges the island into outerspace , like a night temp for UPS . He does n't need to figure anything out , he just uses his "" super strength "" . And Lex Luther 's brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk.To say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a KNIFE of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream AND the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face , but he just averted his eyes and nose like it was n't Grey Poupon he was looking at ."	0
Most war films made in the US during WWII were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else . I am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable . However , because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films . A perfect example was the John Garfield film Air Force -- in which a B-17 nearly single - handedly takes out half the Japanese air force ! However , Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure -- scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner . When I first saw this film , I thought it was NOT a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true . However , after researching further I found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor . This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true !	1
""" Dressed to Kill "" has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years , but it is a true American classic , a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller.I sincerely hope the DVD release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it ."	1
I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing . Everything about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting . As far as film is concerned I would n't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic . It gets it 's meaning across . The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie . Corben Berbson , Fred Gwynne , Ruben Blades , and Ed O'Neil are hilarious . For this who have n't seen it , I will give you a brief synopsis : Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist . However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey , they try to figure out what s going on and all hell breaks loose . The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven , only with four criminals who ca n't stand each other , and in Montana rather than Las Vegas . All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie .	1
As many others have stated , this is a terrible movie , from every aspect of movie making . How they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing.Many people have complained that it was shot on ' cheap ' video cameras . Yes , it was shot on video , but not ' cheap ' video . What made it bad was the lighting , white balancing , shooting technique and editing.There were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess . Harsh , inconsistent lighting , over use of hand held shooting ( ala Woody Allen ) , choppy editing ( another Allen technique ) , but poorly done , without real purpose.The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing ; very amateurish.The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level.How this video ever made it to print is beyond me . It is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is .	0
"After seeing only half of the film in school back in November , today , I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.The book that the film is based on , Hatchet , is OK . This is a terrible adaption of it though.Awful ( and I mean awful ) acting , bad dialogue , and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet.The film starts off Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen ( sporting a mullet , banging his head to cheap 80s rock music ) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad ( his parents are divorced ... now cue the dramatic pause . ) Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father . The pilot is a fat , ugly , rude man ( was n't like that in the book ) who after 2 minutes in the air , has a heart attack and dies . In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.The plane ( within another two minutes ) has gone empty on fuel ( leaving us , the viewers , to assume that he 's been up there for hours even though the sun has n't changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same . ) Now 's he 's crashed landed.This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book . In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips ( looks like he just bought it ) , it never said he climbed a mountain , saw a wolf , and fell asleep up there on the mountain , it never said he was attacked by a bear ( it said a moose but not a bear ) , it never said he eats the several bugs that he does , it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows , skin them , and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes ( that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes ) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.I do n't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado . All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.My favorite part of this camp fest was Brian 's lame flashbacks ( that are never mentioned in the book ) especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up , walking over to the window and seeing his Dad ( with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck ) leaving and screams "" DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD ! ! ! ! "" ( yet of course his father did n't hear him even though he was just right outside ) and he punches his fist through the window ( wtf ? ) < br />The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book ( I said close . ) In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was "" you 're the kid who they 've been looking for ! They stopped months ago ... "" yet they left that line out in the movie.There 's a pathetic epilogue with Brian ( somehow without counseling or therapy ) getting back to normal with his family . I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving ( because they had a turkey on the counter . ) Then it shows his temporary home ( for what , in the movie , seemed like three days , but in the book was for several months ) and his hatchet , still in a tree where he left it ( also did n't happen in the book ) showing where he carved a message , so perfectly done : "" HOME "" ( where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet ? ) < br />No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said "" this is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again . "" Perfect description of this movie.I would n't recommend it to somebody ( who has n't read the book ) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book ( because they 'll be disappointed and bored to death.For those who have read the book , leave what your imagination created as the movie . This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.1/10"	0
This is a great movie that I do n't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta 's career . He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her . Instead , he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood . Even though it was made in 1980 , it is still timely today . The great country music soundtrack is terrific . 10/10	1
Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest . Only Hawn 's well - known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice . Goldie 's got ta be a contender for an actress who 's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal ... <br / >	0
Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars . I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film . In this sequel , Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . From that point , we only wait until she starts having crises . Soon enough , she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur . Apart from Glen Close , I found all cast quite silly but from a child 's eye funny . That is fair enough as its target market is , I assume , children under 12 . Quite a good entertainment for children and families , but did n't do much for me . * out of * * * * *	0
"this was a fantastic episode . i saw a clip from it on YouTube , and i vowed that should it ever show on TV , i would glue myself to the set in order to watch . i wound up watching it with a friend of mine , who happens to be gay , and the two of us cried at the end . this was a truly well - written , heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who , i felt , really were ( in Coop 's words ) "" the Lucky Ones "" . it is episodes like this one that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and much - loved works of television magic on CBS . i anxiously await more episodes , and a re - run of "" Forever Blue "" because i will always watch it again and again ."	1
"Because some people , like me , like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it , including the ending . Anyway , here 's the ending as I remember it , because I could n't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV . But I 'll tell ya , it sure scared the little kid that I was , and I thought about it for days afterward , and it still stands out in my mind to this day , even though some of the details are a little vague . Abe Vigoda was in this movie ? I do n't remember that ! I did n't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie , and I LOVED Dark Shadows . So , at the end , the lead character ( Belinda Montgomery ? ) is lured by the Judge ( Joseph Cotton , I 'm guessing , even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge ; see how memory fades ? ) to the wedding place , which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind ? Maybe I 've got that wrong ; and Shelley Winters is there laughing , and the Judge has a cape on , and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him , and he throws back the cloak , and he has goat legs , and he announces he 's actually her father , the Devil , and she 's played right into their ( the satanic cult 's ) hands , because the "" mortal "" guy she has fallen in love with ( I guess that 's Robert Foxworth ) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to , The Demon with Yellow Eyes , and yep , sure enough , they show Robert Foxworth , and his eyes glow yellow . There are a lot of close - ups in the last few minutes of the film . Everyone is laughing and rejoicing , except for Belinda Montgomery , who is very unhappy , and cries or screams or something , and that 's the end . The bad guys win ."	0
"As you probably already know , Jess Franco is one prolific guy . He s made hundreds upon hundreds of films , many of which are crap . However , he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the assembly line exploitation . "" Succubus "" is n't his best work ( that s either "" The Diabolical Dr. Z "" or "" Vampyros Lesbos "" ) , but it has many of his trademarks that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large catalog . He combines the erotic ( alternating between showing full - frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination ) and the surreal seamlessly . This is a very dreamlike film , full of great atmosphere . I particularly liked the constant namedropping . Despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious , its amusing to hear all of Franco 's influences.Still , there are many users who do n't like "" Succubus "" and I can see where they 're coming from . Its leisurely paced , but I can deal with that . More problematic is the incoherency . The script here was obviously rushed , and within five minutes into the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on ( and it never really came together from that point on ) . Those who want some substance with their style , look elsewhere . Also , if its a horror film , it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful . Still , I was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that I did n't really mind these major flaws all too much . ( 7/10 )"	1
"By all accounts , this could have been an interesting film . Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth , starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as "" the future of British horror "" , I expected Alex Chandon 's gore fest to live up to the hype.I was wrong.Everything about this film is either cliche or inept . The short story anthology setup was done to death ( and much better ) in the seventies and eighties . Admittedly , the idea of ' the sick room ' did send a chill down my spine , but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.Chandon can not write dialogue . Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence ( the typical ' cop on the edge ' formula . funny , i 'm sure i 've seen that somewhere else before ... ) No Chandon , you are not Tarantino . Or Scorsese . It sounds BAD . Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting ( do n't get me wrong , Dani Filth is a great singer and musician , but actor he ai n't ) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing . Give me Bruce Campbell any day.The visual effects are on the whole poor , with some atrocious CGI , awful gore effects ( for goodness sakes , Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget ) and editing filters that shriek OVER - USE ! As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth 's score ... man , they should sue.The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously , trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience . too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects ( eg : maniac , zombie flesh eaters , the beyond , suspiria etc ) , rendering Cradle of Fear , in my mind , second - rate and obsolete.I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.Better luck next time ."	0
"The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun . Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that so called "" Blood "" which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch.Most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie . The rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time , the ending was awful , the outlines were cheesy , and the scenes were terrible . What else more should I say to you viewers out there ? My advice would be to get your Rabies shot if you 've already watched the movie . This movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you did n't get your up - to - date shots ."	0
I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie . But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into.I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.I finally know what hell is like . It 's this movie . For eternity . This movie has no value . It did n't even really have a plot . There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can . You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.Don't even watch it . Not even to see how bad it is . I beg you . If you watch it , then it means they win .	0
Or listening to , for that matter . Even the soundtrack is a bore . < br />Honestly , this is n't the worst gay movie I 've seen ( that would be Regarding Billy ) , but it 's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.This thing drags and drags and drags . It 's not that the plot is inane -- in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining . There 's not one plot point you ca n't see coming for ten miles down the road . The dialog is flat . The jokes are old . To add insult to injury , it 's full of one - dimensional , stereotypical gays . < br />Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible , much less real . There was no chemistry , no dynamic , in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we 're just told they 're in love . Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and are n't compatible sexually . They like the same book ? Huh?The acting is not totally bad , but the pacing is excruciatingly slow . I mean , almost Jarmusch- slow , but without Jarmusch quality . In fact , that would be a good barometer for you . If you like Jarmusch films , avoid this one .	0
Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action / thriller written and directed by the master of suspense , Wes Craven , himself . The whole movie starts with some trouble at The Lux Atlantic , a hotel in Miami . The problem is all fixed by Lisa Reisert , the manager of the hotel . Then she goes to the airport , and that 's where all of the trouble begins . She meets Jackson Rippner , who does n't like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper , if you know you him and I mean . Then they board the plane , and crazy enough , Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other . For the next half - hour , Lisa is terrorized , tormented , and terrified by Rippner . I wo n't give anything away . Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport . Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay , and crazily enough , Rippner is already there . There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene . In total , about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end.Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it . Like I said , I will not give anything away because it 's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing / frightening . And the acting from every single character in the movie , even the ones with no lines at all , were all pitch perfect . It was incredible . Everything was awesome in this movie ! The acting , the music , the effects , the make - up , the directing , the editing , the writing , everything was wonderful ! Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense . Red Eye is definitely a must - see and is definitely worth spending your money on . You could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boring.Red Eye I have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars.Original MPAA rating : PG-13 : Some Intense Sequences of Violence , and Language < br />My MPAA rating : PG-13 : Some Very Intense Sequences of Violence , and Language < br />My Canadian Rating : 14A : Violence , Frightening Scenes , Disturbing Content	1
"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie , because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate , well - crafted independent film . Damn that opening shot for filling me hope . As the "" film "" progressed in a slow , plodding manner , my thoughts were varied in relation to this "" film "" : Was there too much butter in my popcorn ? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this "" film "" ? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office ? Yes , dear reader . I saw this film in the Theatre ! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre , because at home you can TURN IT OFF . Were there any redeeming values ? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college "" nerd "" had his moments , especially in a dog collar .

As an Altman fan , I 'd sought out this movie for years , thinking that with such a great cast , it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.Big mistake.This is one of Altman 's big - cast mishmashes , thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally ( or so it feels ) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room . It doesn't.As Maltin points out , this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard , who outshines the vets all around her . But other than that , avoid at all costs . ( Which is pretty easy to do -- it 's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley 's Comet . )	0
I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time . The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension , especially when landing , yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago ! Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested Alta should dress more modestly , and as an engineer , was amazed by the imagination used for the ' futuristic ' gadgets , and gizmos dreamed up by the props department . All in all , an entertaining hour and a half , my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a ' young ' man	1
"I guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings . Well , so I was . And so I really love this movie . Especially I like all those flawless superheroes from LotR being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied . Most brilliantly is the counterpart of Gandalf ( the brave and wise and completely humorless know - it - all wizard ) : Almghandi , the cowardice and brain dead transvestite . Sauron 's counterpart ( "" Sauraus "" from East Germany , of course ) is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet . Aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ( "" Ulrike "" the legend ) with scotch tape . And "" Strunzdumm "" ( the counterpart of Wormtong ) indeed has some strong resemblance with Brad Dourif ! And do n't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh - huh"	1

A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made	0
"The Marquis De Sade , Egypt , ancient Gnostic cults , Robert Englund in a dual role , gratuitous sex and nudity , murder and mayhem ... on paper Tobe Hopper 's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun , entertaining flick given the ingredients . It 's not . It is a plot less , incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment . There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her . That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking . Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness , dream sequences and erotic encounters , intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery . It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness , bad acting , sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.There are n't too many good points . Robert Englund is fun to watch , as always and the lead actress , Zoe Trilling , whilst not very talented , is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore . At least I got to see the movie from which the "" When you 're as criminal as I "" bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from ."	0
"I remember reading all the horrible , horrible reviews for this film when it came out . I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks . The only other movie to manage that is Gigli . < br />When the movie came out on DVD , I bought it to see how awful it was . I could n't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible . After seeing it , I can understand . < br />First off , let me say that this film is not without some cool shots . There 's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun , which I thought was neat . And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at ; but it gets old after the first time you see it . < br />Let me start with the worst thing in this movie : Tara Reid . If bad acting was a sin , then Hell would 've chucked Tara Reid right out since she 's so unbelievably awful in this movie it 's unthinkable . And of all the roles , she plays a curator . Now if she played a dumb , empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character . Apparently , Uwe Boll did n't realize that , although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie , people would see it . He just did n't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad . And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping ? I could n't tell . < br />Which brings me to my next complaint : Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you 'll ever see in a movie . I mean , I 'd give House of the Dead an F ( and I only do that for very few movies ) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk . The movie starts off with a very , very long narration that causes immediate confusion ( and read by a horrible narrator ) and from there , the cuts are really , really dumb . There 's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that 's been destroyed and the screen blackens out . When it comes back , Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly , an entire army has joined them . Huh ? < br />And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie . At one point , a team breaks through glass , but the glass breaks before they touch it . Tara Reid 's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade , you can see her begin to get up . < br />As for the story ... I was really lost . Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone "" opens the path "" or something and all the evil monsters pop out . It 's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes ( the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film ) that get , quite simply , BORING . < br />I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was . I did n't laugh , but I still think it 's stupid . Very , very , very stupid ."	0
I love this movie . I mean the story may not be the best , but the dancing most certainly makes up for it . You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them . I just think that you wo n't like this movie unless you 're into Broadway ...	1
"* WARNING . THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD , IF YOU CARE.*Okay , the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is : College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff . In practice , it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on . A bunch of frat boys , along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers , is setting up a charity haunted house . The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character , whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible . I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity : he 's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone , including his girlfriend and his buddy . Regardless , the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin - carving champion "" Pumpkin Jack "" , an elderly coot who is described as the "" Santa Claus of Halloween "" , and who drops off a load of props for the house , including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe - flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir - fry ) . Needless to say , some damn fool starts messing with the book , and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones , and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive . There 's some good stuff in this film , but not much : everything is shot well , and the makeup effects are decent . On the other hand , the performers either underact , or overact drastically ; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a "" this happens so that can happen "" series ; there is hardly any musical score to speak of , just snatches of songs throughout the film ; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere . That last problem is the most telling : two - thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters . Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak , but he used to date Jill , who is now dating Dan the jerk , but she 's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls / capes . Dan is a really big jerk , Gary likes to play jokes , and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex . Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on , to the point where the lesbian "" sex "" scene(calm down , it 's pretty tame ) left me looking for the fast forward button . That leaves us with half an hour of lo - calorie scares , a klunky ending and a deep - seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack , who I blame for the whole mess . Unless you can get this on some sort of deep - discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store ) , put it back on the shelf and keep looking ."	0
"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company ( with Disney keeping the Miramax brand ) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under - promoted and seen by few . THE FLOCK is a prime example.A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders , this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU.Richard Gere gives his best - ever performance as the soft - spoken agent worn - out by the task . Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role ( instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in ) and she makes the most of playing the novice . The cinematography , pacing , editing , all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention - deficit - disorder camera jump - around or excess camera cuts that others complained about . The subject is handled with restraint , but it 's still a tough subject and might make you sick.Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded . Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the "" rights "" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper 's paradise for sexual perversity , both willing and unwilling . Each such step was met with praise by Liberals , who celebrated the Warren Court 's ill deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek . Everyday liberals also praised the Court 's action and mocked those who disagree . In 2007 how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to , and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office . Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone 's family to shreds.Richard Gere is a Liberal , but he gives his best in his performance here . Perhaps in his maturing age he 's gained a measure of wisdom ."	1
"In fact , Marc Blitzstein 's off - Broadway adaptation of "" Threepenny "" was not so "" bowdlerised "" as is generally believed.(I have a special interest in "" Threepenny "" ; my dad was part of the first full production in the US ; U of Illlinois Theatre Guild did it around the end of WW2 . HJitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages { neither English } , a German prompter 's script and similar sources . ) Blitzstein 's adaptation -- not a "" translation "" -- which had the full approval of Lotte Lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed.The problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the MGM cast recording ( recently available on Polygram on CD)(which includes Beatrice Arthur { as Lucy , the "" big complete girl "" , and ca n't i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line -- Bea was a major babe in the 50 's } , Paul Dooley and John Astin ) was heavily censored by Mike Curb , head of MGM Records -- i mean , 17 ( i think it was ) "" Goddamn""s got cut to just "" damn"".(At one time , MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the * entire * play , doubtless as heavily censored . )"	0
"Even thought I 'm not the biggest of Cher fans , this movie was her crowning achievement . Granted , there were long term side - effects and risks of brain damage , memory loss ( and ) intellectual impairment , upon the screening such a film . A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one - third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 % claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.Cher plays someone very un - Cher in this movie , a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family . They 're anti - American , pro - Italian and always at each other in someway . She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while , a nice mamma 's boy man , and he asks her to marry him . She says yes . I loved her mom 's questions : "" Do you love him Loretta ? "" , "" No . "" , "" Good . If you love him he 'll drive you crazy because they know they can . But you like him then ? "" , "" Oh yeah , he 's a sweet man Ma "" . When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother , he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he 's been estranged from for years.This victory for human rights carries even greater significance , as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment . In 1938 , Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti , saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs , easing the job of slitting their throats . Cerletti was inspired , and began experimenting with electroshock on humans , developing the first Electroshock machine . Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.This was , in so many ways , an anti - American movie . It 's about love , to be sure , but it 's also about infidelity , secrets , lonely people , and strange behavior brought on by American policies . The characters , from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant , the aunt and uncle , her parents and their problems , the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters . It 's somewhat of a chick flick , as it 's how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp . It 's a Cinderella story in many ways , and that is every little girl 's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan ... Assuming free and fully informed Consent , it is well to reaffirm the individual 's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses .

"As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany , I could n't wait for this to come out on DVD . I missed it when it was first on in 2003 . I do n't want to repeat what 's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies . A better job could 've been done portraying the "" charming "" Hitler . I also had a small problem with some of the casting choices , not so much for their acting , but for their appearances . Peter Stormare does n't look much like Rohm , why did n't they make Babson as Hess wear a wig ? And my biggest complaint .. so much has always been made of Hitler 's striking blue eyes , why did n't they make Carlyle wear blue contacts ? On the plus side , I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good . Again , as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st , history 2nd I do n't think a lot of harm will be done ."	1
Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since Family Guy . It was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at Dreamworks Animation . Like The Simpsons , the show centers around a nuclear family ( of white lions , in this case ) . It also contains many memorable supporting characters including Roger the surly orangutan , Vincent the Italian - American flamingo , the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria , the faux patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney the elephant . The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and Roy . They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner , making the most mundane activities entertaining . The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues ( drugs , prejudice , etc ) is the source of the program 's brilliance.The blame for this show 's failure lies with NBC . They opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order ( perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote ) rather than the more logical production order . Several times , the show was preempted for an extra half - hour of such dreck as The Biggest Loser ( as if 60 minutes of that was not enough ) ! It is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate.Luckily , the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following . 10/10	1
"* Contains some spoilers * This movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness . The plot takes way too long to get off the ground , never steadies itself , and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film . There are a few gem moments for zombie fans , but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror.The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance . First , there 's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs . The hero of the movie is an ex - Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob . The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail . In this jail , they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior . But the badie psychotic head scientist / military guy has other plans in mind . He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make .... da da da .... super soldiers ! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine , the military / crazy scientist guy goes "" hey this might be a problem "" and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra - empowered independent woman character , who of course invented the original serum . She goes to the prison to see what 's going down , the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison , and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out . The hero guy and the scientist / journalist lady team up to find a cure , save the warden 's kids , and deal with some irate prisoners , both infected and not . Meanwhile , the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother . The military gets ready to blow the place up , and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out.There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars . There 's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner . Still , the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film , when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner.The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end . The hero , woman , and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route . Their path leads them to a long hallway , on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars . Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through , gracing their hair and faces as they pass by . There 's also a few good scenes of the classic "" couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies "" and "" many zombies ripping one guy to shreds "" bits.Overall , worth watching if you 're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichés worth noting ; it 's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie . But if you 're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare , you should look elsewhere ."	0
This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie . Jacob Have I Loved is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen . There is no storyline , plots disappear , and the editing is awful . To top it all off , the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible . Bridget Fonda 's acting is decent , but everyone else 's acting is totally amateur . I would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut - scenes , bad transitions and acting that should have been re - shot ! Read the book and do n't waste your time with this film .	0
In all honesty , this series is as much a classic ( as television goes ) as the original poem is to the world 's literature . Far from being crassly exploitative , it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture 's defining texts.I was moved by the plight of Odysseus and his followers ; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy ( which was felt but not seen ) ; intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals . ( It should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creatures flitting around on their ankle wings , or poorly - cast fashion models in bikinis . As in Homer 's work , they act through mortal agents or , rarely , are represented by classical statuary).It 's a pity it 's not available in DVD , especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video stores .	1
"This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "" The Gun That Won The West "" To cowman , outlaw , peace officer or soldier , the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession . An Indian would sell his soul to own one ... Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart , a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new , psychological depth to the genre . The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father . Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend , Johnny Williams { Millard Mitchell } , Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown { Stephen McNally } , the man he wants . But with Wyatt Earp { Will Geer } having taken all the guns from those entering the town , both men are unable to have the shoot - out that they are ready for . The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle , a competition that Lin eventually wins . But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize , Dutch ambushes him , steals the rifle and skips town fast . As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle , the rifle will changed hands a number of times , with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so - called "" psychological Western "" , Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past . Tho shot in black and white { the only one of the duos Westerns that was } the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes . The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback , and in silhouette , amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City . It 's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam , proving once and for all that he was one of Americas finest and most versatile actors . The support cast is n't too bad either . Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo , while Mitchell , McNally , Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings . There 's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here , tho the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang , who even had the script ready to run . But Lang walked away from it , something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans . For as great as a director that Lang was , with Mann directing { and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands } it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre . Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced , but also in who they influenced . The likes of Budd Boetticher , Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes , and gleefully for the Western purists , they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.A big hit at the box office back on release , Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age . 9.5/10"	1
OK , I am not Japanese . I do know a little about Japanese culture , and a little less about Japanese pop culture . Other than that , I am Spanish , I eat paella and I like black humor.Good , with that point set , I can comment on the movie : I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences , Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head , and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this . It may just be one of those lost - in - translation cases , I am afraid it is , but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible . The jokes seemed bad , the script was overcooked- I mean , give the audience a break , and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast - paced speaking and absurd action.However , I thought the animation was really cool . The idea is great , and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . However , the eye - candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo - jumbo speech over still pictures . It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut - out hysterical characters scene.I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . The idea was good but horribly exploited . Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie , or maybe it will be more and more over - narrated scenes . But hell , if you thought Talking Head was dense , Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.Of course , all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European . Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people , maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . Maybe .	0
"Maybe it was the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the DVD , which is with the director as he keeps saying "" hi , kids "" into the camera like a buffoon ) , but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal , bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator . Turns out it 's way too sleazy for its own good , or bad , or whatever . There 's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust , similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence . Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies ! And with the killing scenes , there has to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature / killer / whatever . Entrails of a Virgin has neither . It 's safe to say it 's a pretty soulless movie , even if is n't one of the very worst ever made- it 's there just for horn - dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ' other ' heads.In this case , we 're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "" A Murderer "" as he 's credited . First off , the director Kazuo ' Gaira ' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere . It looks like it 's from another movie . Then once settled into the house , there 's a ' wrestling ' scene that 's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him ' all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killings . First the rape , by the photographers , who promise the girls some jobs for their time . Then the Murderer , who like D'Amato 's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.Now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlights of the movie . This is like saying , however , that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . An eye - gouging scene , a spike thrown like an Olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex - crazed girl , whose inconsequential name I ca n't remember . Even * this * becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! On top of this , the sex scenes , which become tedious through ' Gaira ' and his indulgence in long - takes - without - cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actors ( you 'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them ' speak ' for themselves ) . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it 's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch as the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , tries to stop the murderer from getting to her , which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him ! ) You just want it to be done with , for the ' I hate women ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether ."	0
If you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy , then look no further.Starting at about the halfway point , the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity . That is the only thing that made this movie worth watching.The story is both lame and preposterous , the humor is corny , and character development is basically non - existent .	0
The Honey , I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous . I loved Honey , I shrunk the Kids when I was little . It was an original story and had such an exciting plot ! The sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other 's company . Now Honey , I blew up the kid was pretty stupid , so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.Basically , Adam is a little more grown up now and the mom 's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children . But when Wayne 's favorite item is threatened for the garbage , he wants to shrink it and keep it , but he and his brother get in the way . But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son , they get caught in the machine as well , leaving the kids in the house alone!The plot is silly , but like I said , it was just a family film that I think some might get a kick out of . The original Honey , I Shrunk the Kids is the best , I think everyone could agree . The third one was n't so bad , I would recommend this one at least over Honey , I Blew Up the Kid movie , it was at least a little more fun.4/10	0
Unfortunately , this movie is so bad . The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny , of course they used the script written by Neil Simon . For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again . Even the audience I was with never laughed . The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park . They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York , well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick . The whole movie winds up being like this ... a joke is set up and given away . Why is n't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie . You will also notice every close up of Goldie ( they use a very intense soft lens ) . I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis , that 's if you want to laugh .	0
"When you 're making a thriller about witchcraft , I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work . Some pictures ( "" Rosemary 's Baby "" , for example ) have accomplished this ; others ( like "" Necromancy "" ) have n't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy . This film does have some atmospheric moments , but about half the dialogue is hard to make out ( sometimes it 's poorly recorded , at other times just incomprehensible ) and Orson Welles , who gets top billing , has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work . Or maybe he was simply having fun ..... (*1/2 )"	0
Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberry 's mission . Their focus on homosexuality , depression , war , and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies . The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved , the stories are more complex , and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive . In season 6 episode 1 , Countermeasures , there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history . The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting . The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds , but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters . There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know . I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked !	1
The opening 5 minutes gave me hope . Then Meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie . Absolute lowest common denominator humor . Painful viewing . A complete chore . Written no doubt in less than a week , just like the first one . Give Meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell . And do n't let him out until he 's developed a decent script for something , anything . He has it in him . These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing . < br />Let Goldmember sink without trace .	0
I really enjoyed this film . All aspects of the film were top notch including the most important , for me anyway , the screenplay and the acting . This is definitely one of Richard Widmark 's strongest roles . He is totally convincing in his performance . Just out of curiosity , imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have tackled this role . This is my first exposure to Jean Peter 's work that I can remember . She impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work . Thelma Ritter , in an unglamourous role , deserved the Oscar nomination she received for playing the informant . This film works on every level . The black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning . Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance . Strongly recommended , 9/10 .	1
One of the greatest film I have seen this year . Last maybe before sun rise , which is also seen late at night alone in the lab . I like the idea of the film , which suggest free will of man and our weakness against fate . With time past by James and Kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes . I do like the end . but a big question also comes . The virus shall not be released again , should it?In the last scene in the airport . Jose is sent back to meet James again by future scientists . When he tell him that scientists had already got his message and know someone else would spread the virus . And they two together meet Kathryn when Kathryn tell James the true man is DR . Goines assistant . So it is clearly Jose also get the true information about the virus,(James keep an eye on him at the time remember ? ) and he has teeth . So why everything is still happen ? ? Why future scientists do n't do anything after the truth is revealed ? ? My biggest question after the film ...	1
"John Hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the ' 80s . "" European Vacation "" is not one of them . The follow - up to Hughes ' first big hit "" Vacation "" ( 1983 ) , is about as predictable , unfunny and annoying as they come -- no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic Clark and Ellen Griswold ( Chase and D'Angelo).I greatly enjoyed "" Vacation "" as well as the third film , 1989 's "" Christmas Vacation , "" but the Griswold 's trip to Europe is bland and forced . Perhaps because this was Hughes ' first attempt at a sequel that he did n't get it , but it 's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story "" European Vacation "" is . There is no through story : the Griswolds win a game show for being "" greedy little pigs "" and go on a tour of Europe through England , France , Germany and Italy . Even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming , which is part director Amy Heckerling 's fault . The "" Fast Times at Ridgemont High "" director sets everything up too predictably.Maybe it was Hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel . "" European Vacation "" takes great pride in insulting Americans ( recall the greedy little pig game show they win ) , especially tourists , represented by the cornball Griswold family . It also pats itself on the back implicitly saying "" oh us Griswolds , we 're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot . "" Then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to America and how grateful the Griswolds are to return to such a better country . If Hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie , well maybe I should award this 8/10 stars.It 's not just the unfunniness , but "" European Vacation "" boasts the two worst actors to play kids Rusty and Audrey ( Jason Lively and Dana Hill ) . They 're both annoying and obnoxious , with the unattractive and loud - mouthed Audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she 's left behind nearly the entire film . Hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst . Quite tasteful . Speaking of , breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason ( unless it was to comment on Americans ' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies).I will give the film one of its two stars thanks to Eric Idle of the Monty Python crew , whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from "" Holy Grail "" is about the funniest part . If Hughes intended for us to find one of the film 's only non- American actors as the only funny part , then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of Hollywood comedy in the ' 80s . Still , would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining ?"	0
"This film plays in the 60s and is about an Italian family : Romano , his wife Rosa and their two children Gigi and Giancarlo emigrate from Solino in Italy to Duisburg in the Ruhr area . I like this film , because I think it is quite realistic : it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country : they have to get used to a new culture , a new environment and this can be difficult : especially if you do n't know the language .... It is difficult for the family but they find a way : they open a restaurant which offers typical Italian food , and it is named "" Solino "" , like their hometown . The film also shows different conflicts - Gigi and Giancarlo fall in love with the same girl , and although Rosa has to work very hard , Romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers , etc . etc . But stop , I do n't want to tell you how it goes on . You should watch the film yourself , it 's a nice one - I have also made a Referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes . And there are a few ..."	1
Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father , until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty ... I was clicking through the channels and found this .. I read the synopsis and suddenly saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought okay .... and watched the movie .. i did n't realise Elisha had done films before .... 'The Girl Next Door and 24 ' Elisha provides a satisfactory performance , the plot is a little cheesy but the film works ... Its amazing how this young girl went on to become the Hottest babe in Hollywood !	1
"Tony Scott has never been a very good director , but every film he 's made after "" Crimson Tide "" seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today ( Michael Bay may fall into the same category , but at least his big , dumb , delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level ) . And like other overblown Hollywood biopics ( "" De - Lovely "" and "" Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , "" for instance ) chronicling the lives of pretentious , overrated , or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of "" mystique "" by a society that thrives on the juicy behind - the - scenes details , "" Domino "" is a film that begins with little potential , and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty - minute mark . With an already - distended running time of 128 minutes , the film feels twice as long , and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable ( unlike the superior "" Rules of Attraction , "" Scott 's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Domino 's smug , self - aware - rich - girl voice - over only draws attention to the film 's sledgehammer cluelessness ) becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable . The story ? Spoiled - upper - crust - babe Domino Harvey ( Keira Knightley , in an ersatz - badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks ) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles , and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade ; along the way , there are double - crosses , shootouts , media attention ( courtesy of a tongue - in - cheek Christopher Walken , phoning in his trademark sleazebag ) , and laughable hints at romance . Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds , cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon - drenched nightmare that 's frankly unpleasant to watch -- if Scott 's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image , ghost it , or distort it in some way , he will ; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot , characterization , and suspense the film has ( to say nothing for its , ehm , "" entertainment "" value ) . Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical , oftentimes both ( observe the unbearable , several - minute segment where an African - American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on "" Jerry Springer "" ) , and I found myself wishing they would all get the "" tails "" end of our protagonist 's coin by the end . "" Domino "" is utter , unmitigated trash -- whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience , it is lost in a sea of migraine - inducing neon pretension a few minutes in ."	0
"For some reason , in the late 70 's and early 80 's the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in it 's late - night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years , usually at 2 a.m. or some such time . It 's a fitting movie for that time slot since it 's really hard to follow and quite odd ( see the other reviews for specific story info ) . Anyway , after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV ( And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming ) , I kept catching this little oddity . After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD . Well , it is only available ( from every search i 've conducted anyway)in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label "" Brentwood Video "" as part of a 4-pack of movies ( 4 movies on 2 double sided discs)called "" Alien Worlds "" if anyone is interested . It 's usually available for around $ 10-but even much less if you shop around . The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies , so no need to comment on them here . But I have n't seen "" Eyes "" available anywhere else . Though hardly a "" restored "" version in any way , this print runs exactly 92 minutes , so for once IMDb 's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct . Even with the 92 minute running time it 's not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed . It seems to be a common budget - conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story . Would a longer version make in any less confusing ? Who really knows - unless you 've seen it in it 's native language ... By the way , my attempts to watch this during the day do n't work and I end up just turning it off . There 's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie .. or maybe it 's just from my earlier experiences , who know ? ?"	0
"Any story comprises a premise , characters and conflict . Characters plotting their own play promises triumph , and a militant character readily lends oneself to this . Ardh Satya 's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by Dilip Chitre . The line goes - "" ek palde mein napunsaktha , doosre palde mein paurush , aur teek tarazu ke kaante par , ardh satya ? "" . A rough translation - "" The delicate balance of right & wrong ( commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts ) has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another . Is the needle on the center a half - truth ? "" < br />The poem is recited midway in the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a resturant . It makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow . At the end of the film , Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem.The film tries mighty hard to do a one - up on the poem . However , Chitre 's words are too powerful , and at best , the film matches up to the poem in every aspect.<br / >"	1
"A very silly movie , this starts with a soft porn sequence , ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery , adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason.What follows is bizarre and surreal ( the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary ) , culminating in a revelatory "" twist "" ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer ( see the trivia section for precisely why it 's deliberately unfair).The movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals , the insane , and the wonderful "" Huggie Bear""-style racial stereotyping on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes , as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film . Though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch.In fact , the whole movie is a joy to watch : Despite its many , many flaws , the whole package just , well , works ."	1
I give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper 2 . It does not make sense to you ? Well , it does n't have to . This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot , no , let me rephrase , incredibly idiotic plot , where space cowboys ( complete with cowboy hats ) battle a space race of moron vampires.Does it get any uglier than this ? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe , with her stunning Norwegian beauty . God , I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies ! I mean , at least SeaQuest was nice ! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies , he has acted in 164 movies at this date ! ! It 's true that he was rarely in a major role , but still !	0
Luckily , not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV . And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!But I 'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie . There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots , but also very chilling and even daring moments . Considering the production year 1969 , the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows . Of course now it does n't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done . And it 's not just because of the two George 's actresses.The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly , no wonder , And it certainly did hit me . Very effective . Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action . This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side , but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad . Well , being a case of war , mostly bad.For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must . His work is always excellent , touching but never over the top . And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall . Talk about Fräulein ! Let 's hope they get this on DVD soon , so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem .	1
"In New York , the family man dentist Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) by chance on the street . Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife . Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other . Alan tries to fix Charlie 's life , sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst ( Liv Tyler ) , but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.""Reign Over Me "" is a good drama about loss , friendship , family and loneliness . The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot ; it could be a car accident , a fire or any other tragedy , as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar , played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows , to Alan . But the family drama works , supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle . Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized , I do not know whether she is using excessive make - up to look older , but her face is weird . My vote is seven.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Reine Sobre Mim "" ( "" Reign Over Me "" )"	1
"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene , where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten . Then they start rolling the title credits : You see "" Slugs ! "" in big letters , followed shortly thereafter by "" The Movie . "" WHEW ! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into "" Slugs : The Musical "" or "" Slugs : The Game Show . "" Anyway , from there the movie deteriorates into a kill - fest . You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove , two people get attacked by slugs while having sex , and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs . It 's a pretty silly movie , falling in the "" so - bad - it's - good "" category . It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you 're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 ( my guess was 1974 ) . I 'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here , because most people here do n't give those types of movie any love . But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable , this is one of your prime candidates ."	0
"I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "" festival des nouvelles images du Japon "" in Paris . Though i was n't expecting much from it , i have to say i 've been disappointed just like many people in the audience ... if i wanted to sum up how i felt , i 'd say i 've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end . Of course it 's silly . But i could n't help it . The stories are quite different , but the worlds pictured are very much alike . And from this point of view , "" a tree of palme "" definitely ca n't stand the comparison with Miyazaki 's masterworks . Even if it 's quite good technically , boredom remains ... in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it . I rated it 2 out of 10 ( a bit harsh , i guess it deserves 3 or 4 )"	0
"Let 's see ... I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything , so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer?I know ! The performances were -- no , that wo n't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from Gwyneth Paltrow , usually so vibrant , and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... Oh - how 'bout the story -- nope . That is n't gon na fly either , as it was doze - inducing . What was the genre anyway ? It was n't funny , that rules out comedy . It was n't interesting enough to be dramatic . Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow ? I have to ask , as I ca n't be sure - let 's just call it "" losers in like . "" I 'm sure those behind this film started with a vision , I mean , they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits , but I need help finding it.Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story , I could n't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy , fluffy , stupid hair . Speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey?What am I doing ? I already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie -- I can not devote any more time to this loser ."	0
"Mindless dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking Sandra Locke . You have no idea what 's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song "" Suzanne "" being played over and over throughout the movie until when "" The Second Coming of Suzanne "" is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.This off - the - wall armature movie maker Logan , Jared Martin , is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project . Planning to go on his own Logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman Suzanne , Sandra Locke , who reminds him of someone he knew in another life : Jesus Christ.With Logan 's assistant and all around gofer Clavius , Richard Dreyfuss , somehow getting a $ 740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan 's masterpiece he starts to work on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film . This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist Simon , Paul Sand , but later Simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.The movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub - plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl Dorothy , Kari Avalos , who 's cured of her autism by Suzanne after everyone else , at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to , failed . It 's not really known what exactly Suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there ; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she , like Jesus , could miraculously heal the sick?There 's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair , Gene Barry , who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid - life crisis or has seen a biblical - like vision that changed his life forever . Sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it 's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there 's all this suffering in the world , like this movie that he 's in , and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne . Sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur David , Mark Rasmusser , who 's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the Pacific Coast.The movie "" The Second Coming of Suzanne "" goes on with a number of unrelated sequences , probably to fill or pad in some time by it 's director and film editor , and then goes to it 's final scene in a Christ - like crucification on a hill as Logan has all the cameras rolling . It turns out that the crazed Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate , on the helpless and tied up Suzanne , the actual crucification of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago.Hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow "" The Second Coming of Suzanne "" puts you through the same kind torture that Suzanne is put through by Logan and the makers of the film . The movie tries to be arty but that 's just an excuse to cover up it 's brainless and non - existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it ."	0
so ... it 's really sexist , and classist , and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie , like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well , he certainly changed his tune , and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero , it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .	0
I was pleasantly surprised by the film . Let 's face it ; the premise does n't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the night 's flick , but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over . There were no moments that I found uproarious , and I doubt any that I 'll remember the next day , but this does n't fail as a nice diversion . What I found funny was watching it here in Peking with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like . I told her there was a plot- three guys have to bring back some weed to London . Hardly satisfying for her . There is no mugging going on here for the camera which I 'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments . I do take exception however to comparisons with Withnail and I ; not in the same league , and I doubt was it intended to . www.imperialflags.blogspot.com	1
A killer , cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder . At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave . This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look . The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem , are back on the case . Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing . Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection . Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film . The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out . Now I 'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible . If it was n't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep . There is a bit of gore but it 's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims . The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times . There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll . The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film . It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.The ending is extremely bad . You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does . God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel . < br />4/10	0
The one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel , was i would never get the time I used to watch this , back again . If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and earn what must have been then , the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned . Wooden acting , poor special effects , the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b - movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie . The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds , whilst the Police , Military and Joe public do n't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee , dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once . She must obviously be from another planet . Just where I wish I was when this movie was on .	0
"The first ( and only ) time I saw "" Shades "" was during a Sneakpreview . It had n't even been in premiere . I remember there was someone of the directors staff there , do n't even remember who . It was a Belgian movie , we never heard of it , so we were quite neutral , not knowing what to expect . Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he 's stands miles ahead all the rest . He plays an actor who 's star has long stopped rising . He 's helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled "" Shades"".As soon as the movie started , we noticed how much swearing there is . Nothing against the occasional swear word . However this was way beyond annoying . Whenever Rourke uses the F * * * word to express something , it comes naturally . However , when someone from the cast , a non - English speaker uses the F * * * * or S * * * word , it becomes arrogant and aggressive.We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words . Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre . And we had to give a vote , but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 , and we were looking for the -10 ."	0
"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas , capped by such statements like "" we all create our own reality"".Sorry , folks , reality is what true for all of us , not just the credulous.The idea that "" anything 's possible "" does n't hold water on closer examination : if anything 's possible , contrary things are thus possible and so nothing 's possible . This leads to postmodernistic nonsense , which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas , well - founded and stupid , are equal.To quote sci - fi writer Philip K. Dick , who put it so well , "" Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n't go away . """	0
Prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and ' happy vibes ' , what with stories of fights , chaos , murder and of course extreme male bonding ! But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether . Horror films set in cells are , as you probably know , nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema . With such examples as THE CHAIR ( Waldermar Korzeniowsky , 1988 ) , THE GREEN MILE ( Frank Darabont , 1999 ) , ALIEN 3 ( David Fincher , 1992)and of course the entire Women In Prison exploitation genre itself , another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised . Or at least that 's what you 'd have thought . PRISON is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it 's somewhat of a shame that it is n't as well known as it should be.The film , in short , centres on an old prison ( well , duh ! ) which has been reopened . However , it 's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear , but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind ; death ! And boy , are we treated to some awesome death scenes ! I wo n't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands.Besides the special effects and the murders , this film also has another thing going for it ; it 's cast . Headlining , we have LORD OF THE RINGS ( Peter Jackson , 2001 - 2003 ) star Viggo Mortensen ( and for all those so inclined , yes , he does get naked ) whose performance is not only highly believable , but is done with such skill that his Eastwood - esquire character is both bad - to - the - bone and likable ( a very delicate mix ) . Add him to a cast of ' hey - wait - a - minute - I - know - that - guy ' actors and you 've got yourself one great set of stars . The characters themselves however lack three - dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical . We 've got a black oculist , a hard - as - nails prison warden , a human - rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters . But in all honesty , this ' fault ' actually aids the film . Instead of boring character development in an over - long equilibrium , we are chucked , more or less , straight into the action and once it gets going ( very early on ) there 's not a single scene that 's a filler  it 's balls to the wall plot . Unlike a certain SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ( Frank Darabont , 1994 ) ! Sharing conventions with the slasher genre , this is somewhat of a convention itself , and , in good ol' slasher genre tradition , PRISON punishes those who have been bad.All in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world . With an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans . Do n't be fooled into thinking it 'll be a cheesy little film either , just because it was made in USA 1980s , it 's far from cheesy ( although the very end does ruin this ) and , simultaneously , far from gritty and realistic ( whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape , these are rather subtly done).I give it 3.5 out of 5 luvs . A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed .	1
I do n't remember this film getting a cinema release over here . I only saw it when it came onto cable . The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines . Specifically one person , the way he gets replaced and dumped ( literally ) into an off - world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space , and would have been happy if it was.I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple . The scene where he 's sitting outside the compound shows this , albeit the decision for two slow - mo replays detracts from the moment.This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner , Alien , Silent running , Logan 's run or THX1138 were , however it is unfortunately the nearest I 've seen to it in a long time.He changes in the movie to a believable degree , he does'nt crack Arnie one liners , he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.That 's why this film did'nt do well . It did'nt follow formula , and among a 18 - 25 year old target American audience , that 's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.Fear and discipline.Always .	1
"Princess Tam Tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the United States , but there are more subtle ( to the American viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . Pay attention to Alwina 's ( Baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a "" savage "" African , and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . I do n't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention , the dichotomy between "" Eastern "" and "" Western "" culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . The French have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( see Chris Marker 's Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953 ) , and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while they are in Africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the "" other "" . I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like Princes Tam Tam , that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( I am gushing , sorry . ) However the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities ."	1
It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed , and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera . This movie is a dog , from start to finish , and it 's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it . A Viet Nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss , gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself & the war hero framed and sent to prison , death row , specifically . Now , this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine ( a zombie ) . Of course , everything goes wrong and then there 's all these infected people trapped in the prison , some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just do n't want to be there anymore . This just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself , and I stopped it before the end , which seemed like it was coming a few times but no , it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path . If one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves , so do n't risk it . 2 out of 10 .	0
The performances were superb , the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a Victorian Living Historian , I was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.I would n't say you need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge . Do not expect , as some rather silly people do , any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it , it was , at that time , a country during infancy.OK , the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film . Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to ' inspire an interest ' , and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.See it and you WILL NOT be sorry	1
Though this series only ran a season , it has stayed with me for 20 years . It was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever . I would give nearly anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get . If you find any means of seeing this series I suggest you take full advantage . This series was the first one ( in my opinion ) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes . It also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them . Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes . He was just that odd at the time . Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones . If anyone has any way of contacting the creator / holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on DVD please by all means do so ! ! !	1

"[ WARNING : CONTAINS SPOILERS]I have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy . She came to mind when I reflected on the audience 's reaction to "" The Mother . "" < br />People gasped when May ( Anne Reid ) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover , Darren ( Daniel Craig ) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings ' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ( "" My Beautiful Laundrette , "" "" My Son the Fanatic "" ) again proves why he 's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic . His story 's not easy to take . This searing family drama is n't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it 's raw , complex , and often makes us very uncomfortable . Nevertheless , it 's powerfully good stuff.Kureishi and Roger Michell ( who directed "" Notting Hill , "" of all things ) craft an unsentimental , wrenching and superbly - acted portrait of an older woman who realizes , after all these years , she can and should still enjoy all of life 's pleasures . In a wonderfully epiphanous moment , when her son , Bobby , asks her not to be difficult , May shoots back , "" Why not?""Why not , indeed.Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It 's subtle , restrained , powerful and sad , often all at the same time . Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub . Or , when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date . Reid 's eyes and face reveal all of May 's anguish and despair . In the film 's most devastating moment , May drops to her knees before Darren , willing to do anything for him , only asking him to be kind . This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.I enjoyed Michell 's use of natural sound , especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby 's place . It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots , the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.This film , at times , reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh 's work , except "" The Mother "" hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.My one quibble : Michell 's decision to give May and Darren 's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility . The lovers remain out of focus while , in the foreground , a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze . And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion.The problem with Michell 's approach is that both Reid and Craig , who completely envelops the role of Darren , plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it 's unfair to hide their characters ' almost primitive energy from the audience . Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.This film does n't have immensely likable characters . We sympathize with May , but she , too , causes her daughter 's suffering . But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk . His point , I believe , was to unmask a family that 's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens . It 's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable ."	1
I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p . The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t , but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video . Talking of home videos , since when has it been fair game to release them as films - I mean to say , films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame - o ideas together for the weekend , lavish the production with an £ 8.00 budget , and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard ( the soundtrack ) - then slap it on the shelves , for some poor sap ( me ) , to take home in lonely desperation . But here 's the clincher - I fast forwarded through most of this , and tossed it to one side , ready for the hammers ... until the next night , while watching a Darren Day horror ' Hellbreed ' ( £ 1.99 to take home and keep from a different Blockbuster ) . Now this film made ' Grim Weekend ' look like The Exorcist , so I slapped Grim Weekend back on , to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb boards , that viewers claimed were hilarious . Sure enough , once I had got over the misery , the pain , and the horror , of realising Grim Weekend was utter chod on toast , I could enjoy , savour , and downright get down to the funny stuff . And there 's a lot of it . Check the boards . Then check the flick . Hell , it might even be worth it . AWWWWW CRAP !	0
"More than twenty years before Peter Jackson 's visionary adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings , there was this 1978 animated effort from director Ralph Bakshi . An ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story , this has sadly been rather over - shadowed by the Jackson trilogy . Indeed , many reviewers here on the IMDb ( mainly those who saw the newer version first ) seem to be fiercely unkind to this version .... but if one applies a little common sense , and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time , then they will realise that this is a pretty good film . Indeed , it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early ' 80s that I sought out Tolkien 's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed Middle Earth adventures . So , in some respects , I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever.Sauron , the Dark Lord of Middle Earth , forges an all - powerful ring that gives him incredible power . Following a great battle during which Sauron is defeated , the ring falls into possession of a king named Isildur  . but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it . For centuries the ring passes from hand to hand , eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who lives in a peace - loving community known as The Shire . Frodo learns from a wizard named Gandalf that his ring is in fact The One Ring , the very same that was forged by Sauron all those centuries ago , and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land . Frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions , but every step of the way they are hunted by Sauron 's ring - wraiths , the Black Riders . There follow many adventures , during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be "" unmade ""  Mount Doom , in the land of Mordor . The film concludes with Frodo and his best friend Sam on the borders of Mordor , closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination . Meanwhile Gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of Helm 's Deep.This version covers just over half of the original book . A second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end , but was sadly never completed . While the ending feels abrupt , it does at least end at a sensible point in the story . One has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal . The animation is passable , with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail . The music by Leonard Rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative . The voice - overs are decent , too , especially John Hurt as Aragorn and Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum . On the other hand , Michael Scholes - who provides the voice for Sam - is rather campy and goofy , which is not well suited to the character . The Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based ."	1

For everyone who expects a traditional superhero - movie it might be an unpleasant surprise . It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie . It focuses mainly on emotions and it 's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.That 's because Sasha , like each superhero , takes the law into his own hands and the society does n't appreciate it . Sasha becomes an outlaw . While on the run , he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.As you can see , the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics . It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma . Everything happens very slowly . However , when there 's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what 's going on , it 's all over . But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action . What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha 's actions , which are mostly very drastic . The score is very scarce , which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film . So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.Is the film worth it ? That is a question really difficult to answer . I do n't think that this experience enriched me so very much , but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again . Mostly due to the atmosphere , which is really dense , but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope . After all they 're young people , who have all their lives to live . So no matter how hard it gets there 's always a slight joyous tune when they are together .	1
This is one of the few films where I consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book . The story is clear , accessible , amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional . I adored the cyclical rendition of ' The old home guard ' and the charming ' Portobello Road ' , a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which , though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece . The background of the Second World War worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way , which so often happens in ' evacuee ' stories.An often far too underrated film , it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages . The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed . Guaranteed to put a smile on your face !	1
The first time I saw this film , I was in shock for days afterwards . Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention , helped by good acting and some really intriguing music . The ending , quite simply , had me gasping . First rate !	1
Disappointing and irritating . The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion . Character is not explored in depth . These are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element , the mother 's affair with her daughter 's lover . < br />Anne Reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines , such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye . The script portrays Darren ( Daniel Craig ) as a Dr. Jekyll / Mr . Hyde without any hints about why , except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene . < br />A mature writer could have done so much more with this topic .	0
"Five across the eyes ai n't worth one off the wrist , I must admit at one point i was really worried , for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling , me and the speakers are OK now thanks for asking , funnily enough that was the best bit of the film.I wo n't waste your time telling you the plot , read the other comments for that.If you have bought this DVD but not yet unwrapped it Do n't , take it back and demand your money back , i 've wasted mine do n't do the same.I was actually shouting at the telly "" they 're over here in the car , look for the camera lights , and get the camera man first "" , i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go.If anybody would like to buy this film ( it 's really good ) it 's yours for a ten quid ."	0
"If you go to this movie expecting something it is n't , you will be disappointed , as with any movie . This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the "" iceberg effect "" . On the surface , its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie . If this would be written in a book , it would be a short story , because the action in the movie is very fast paced , and unless you actually try to catch it , the reasoning behind the plot ( along with some subtle foreshadowing ) can very well pass you by . Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate . Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie . The camera - work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film , making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others ( something to be desired in American movies as of late ) . Although , at some parts it may get a little raunchy , gruesome and too heavy for some audiences , the movie never becomes completely unrealistic . The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as "" needs improvement "" is the soundtrack selection . No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack , and although the soundtrack is quite fitting , the opening is a little too long , and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate ( heavy , grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip ) . The flooding of imagery and dynamic ... color palettes adds another "" artistic "" aspect to it , also combined with the events that happen throughout the film , this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand . However , that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch , and not one you 'll quickly get bored of . 8.5/10"	1
"Schlocky ' 70s horror films ... ya got ta love 'em . In contrast to today 's boring slasher flicks , these K - tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.This is a B movie about the making of a B movie ... that went horribly wrong . Faith Domergue ( This Island Earth ) stars as an over - the - hill , B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home . Her boyfriend / director , who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude , is filming on location and on a tight schedule . The Ken doll co - star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add "" realism "" . Unfortunately , "" realism "" is something they could have done without.John Carradine , having long since given up looking for the 17th gland ( The Unearthly ) , now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate . He goes about his daily work , but always seems to run afoul of the director.The horror builds slowly ; a dead cat here , John Carradine entering a grave there , finally culminating in seven , yes seven murders . ( At least there 's truth in advertising . ) It 's just sad that the ghoul did n't understand that there was a movie being made above him . How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work ? Face it , you just ca n't go around tugging on Satan 's coat and expect him to take it lying down.Sterno says perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses ."	0
I had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival . I have been attending this festival for over 5 years , and I have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion . However , ' First Bite ' has reached a brand new low in film . In spite of being shot in beautiful locations , with the occasional , exquisite close up of fabulous food , the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until I was practically begging for it to end.The lead actor , David La Haye , completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie , portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end . Additional sub - plots , such as eating disorders , were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point.A theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing , goes nowhere , and completely disappoints .	0
Excellent pirate entertainment ! It has all the good ingredients to keep one 's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue , a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens ( Maureen O'Hara ) who 's attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawke ( Errol Flynn ) who is out on a secret mission of his own . They make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!Anthony Quinn is the mean , bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer . I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor , the protector of young Princess Patma ( Alice Kelley).There is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines , ships , and the bay . Lots of action too of sword fighting clashes , ship battles , daring leaps of Errol Flynn ( Robin Hood on board ship ! ) . From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there 'd be no need to put it to the test here.Very enjoyable movie .	1
They had me from the first show.Welcome to Trinity County . A sleepy little Mayberry - like place with one slight difference . The sheriff is really Satan . There 's the spoiler . Not like you would n't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway.Oh , but that 's not all . It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb . Some people are trying to keep him good , but it 's an uphill battle . Sheriff Buck ( Satan ) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness . Subtle . Sneaky . He does n't always come off as evil . Most of the time he 's a hero . Everyone owes him a big favor , because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it . So every time you think someone will finally take him down , one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it.In one of my favorite episodes , Lucas and Caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them . Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil.The robber ( Ted ) was hesitant to shoot them . Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half a conscience . If he had no conscience , he would have shot them by now . If he had a real conscience , he never would have become a criminal . So he started calling him Half - Ted . It was pretty funny . He was taunting the criminals . And of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of Half - Ted at all times . And of course he was in complete control at all times . They actually had you favoring Satan.Very very excellent show . it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time . Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural < br />That 's good company .	1
"After leaving TV 's popular "" The Andy Griffith Show "" , Don Knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matinée - pleasing comedy vehicles . Unfortunately , "" The Reluctant Astronaut "" , filmed on the cheap ( as were most of Knotts ' movies ) , is much worse than his others . Don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to Astronaut Training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel -- they want him as their new janitor ! Some may say the weak satire capitalizes on Americans ' then - fresh fever for the new age of technology , but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied . It gets off to a good start , with an OK set - up and nostalgic locations , but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic . * from * * * *"	0
An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.(but done several times by now ) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit . The editing could have been tighter . I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits . Maybe the movie was rushed to market . The lighting was too dark in places . But the worst technical problem is the audio . The level was good enough to hear the dialog , but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them , which is very distracting . Either they were not careful in the recording , or the sound mixing could have been better . Also too much background noise got through . The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes . The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle . Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.Also the acting was a bit flat . I am sorry , but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie , in my experience it is a red flag.But it was a good effort so I gave it a 4 .	0
"I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful . Matthew Modine 's days as a leading man are way over . Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed . The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters . I highly doubt this will be picked up , but then again , people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes . I really think "" Kettle of Fish "" is a serious contender for the worst movie I 've ever seen ."	0
A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs , Fred Astaire , Joan Fontaine , and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns.Typically silly plot for an Astaire film has him as an American dance star in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen his secretary . They concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right . He runs into Fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father . Silly plot.The great songs include A Foggy Day , Things Are Looking Up , Nice Work if You Can get It , and I Ca n't Be Bothered Now . Fontaine does not sing , but does a brief ( and decent ) number with Astaire . Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen , including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner , Constance Collier , Montagu Love , Harry Watson ( as Albert ) , Ray Noble , and my favorite -- Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer.Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings Nice Work if You Can Get It . Her facial expressions are hilarious . She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy , The Old Fashioned Way , playing Cleopatra Pepperday.Much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers , who , as noted elsewhere , would have been hideously miscast . The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered . Yikes . Two more would - be disasters . Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to Astaire , with ample comic relief by Burns and Allen.Fun film , great songs , good cast , and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight !	1
"I have three comments to make about this film , which I discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at Blockbuster . First off , it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works . Some have , as Kubrick did with "" Lolita "" , gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work . Of course that ca n't happen here ; Kraft - Ebing is long dead . Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new , unrelated direction ( the recent adaptation of "" Tristram Shandy "" comes to mind here ) . You can dumb it down - the film of "" Slaughterhouse Five "" is to my mind an example of that . Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes . That would be the approach of Woody Allen 's "" Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex "" , and , arguably , this film . Upon consideration , it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like "" Psychopathia Sexualis "" . The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed . And so it is here.Point two is the cinematic style . Some would call it an "" homage "" to Murnau , Pabst , Carl Dreyer , etc . , but I think it more crude than that . Its far too heavy handed and self - conscious to be effective for long . It is eventually just annoying.Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation . How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring ? I found the film impossible to pay attention to , and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well . I do n't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless , but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material , the overt copying of filmic styles , and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level ( possibly for fear of being accused of titillation).The film is a dubious exercise from the start and does n't really work for me , I 'm sorry to say ."	0
I doubt Jigsaw was hip even at the time , the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture . The dated aspect aside , Jigsaw suffers from many problems , including overwrought acting , silly and stilted dialogue , LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds , a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is , on paper , a great vehicle to do just that , and an ending that is so trite and predictable ( not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows ) that the climax is actually an anti - climax . If it was a better movie , we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment , but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook . I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody 's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out . At very best , a three out of 10 .	0
"If you want to see intelligent , philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential , watch "" Waking Life , "" which is brilliant . "" What the # $ * ! Do We Know "" is all over the place in its focus , poorly directed , poorly written , poorly acted , utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying . It was n't thought - provoking or entertaining in the slightest . The inclusion of that rambling freak "" Ramtha "" in this film is reason enough to avoid it . Is n't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something ? What a flake that old chick is , and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was . The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again ."	0
"To be clear from the get go , ' The Bagman ' is very , very , very bad . It suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one : the finished product is such an awful film that it 's actually hysterically funny to watch . This is a very low - grade film . Budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence . I 'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not . For example , the movie takes place in ' Doomsville . ' Note to all prospective home buyers : if the town you 're moving to is called ' Doomsville , ' keep moving . Stephanie Beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen . I could n't help but laugh because it has intentional humour ( she turns on the gas stove ... get it ? The sex is THAT hot ? get it ? ) and unintentional humour . The unintentional in this case is the music . It 's like the theme music for ' Chariots of Fire ' goes Electronica . Break out the computer and the synthesizers ! I realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive . I really feel for them because the work here is so well - intentioned . The problem is that cheap music is n't necessarily good music . I have n't laughed so hard at sex on screen since ' Alone in the Dark ' with that ' Seven Seconds ' song ( I guess they were implying that poor old Mr. Slater was a bit ... quick on the draw ? ) . Even the end credits are hilarious . Intentional or not ? You be the judge : a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast -- and an animal wrangler was on set for them ! -- The boom is credited to ' Mr B. Stick , ' and the 3rd Unit 's wardrobe ( Yep , they had a third unit ) is credited to K - mart . Maybe it 's just me , but I think the hilarity of this more than saves the film . The movie is very , very bad , but the goals of Stephanie Beaton , her friends and family are so well - intentioned in ' The Bagman ' that you ca n't help but like the movie they 've produced . ' The Bagman ' is bad but not dreadful . In its own sweet way , it even manages to be a bit endearing . It wears its flaws so honestly that you ca n't help but forgive them . "" Better "" films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way . I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly.Watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this . Some of them might look cheaper , or have worse acting , or sillier production value . They may not suffer terribly as ' The Bagman ' does from awful editing , sound , and foley effects . Mr B. Stick did n't do a very good job . The special effects look to be where most of the money went . They tend to be more funny than gruesome , although when the ' Bagman ' is finally unmasked at the end , the make - up job there is surprisingly well done.My 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot . This is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand . Great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves B - movie or low budget film aficionados . All others should probably avoid with great prejudice ."	0
This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I 've seen in a very long time . I 've never liked Spike Lee , but thought I 'd give this one a try : bad mistake . The movie is supposed to show how the Son of Sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 ; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems , marriage problems , and so on , etc . The scenes that depict the murders are just that , and nothing more ; a shooting and then it 's back to Saturday Night Fever ! What 's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee 's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie : Spike , trust me , you 're no Hitchcock , stay out of the movies , it makes them even worse off . The most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice , which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot ? ? ? Spike , what were you thinking when you made this film ? Not thinking at all is my guess . People who think they 'll see a crime drama , take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser . You 're better off watching Jerry Springer in this case ! Waste of film , I gave it a 1 out of 10 : awful dud .	0
This movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat out Humphrey Bogart for best actor . I do n't see why Lucile Watson was nominated for best supporting actor , i just do n't think she did a very good job . Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three kids are leaving Mexico and coming into the United States in the first scene of the movie . They are going by train to Davis 's relatives house . Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis so they are very tired and need rest . But when they arrive home , their is a Nazi living there and their 's not much either can do about it . It turns out the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas . Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself .	1
"This movie should be nominated for a new genre : Complete Mess ! Except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore , this movie is a complete waste of time . Calling it "" Campy "" does n't even cut it . "" Campy "" implies fun which this movie was not . You spend the first half of the movie thinking "" Its got to get better , right ? "" . In fairness , it does , at the very end when its finally explained who the "" brother / sister "" team are and what they want but by then , you hardly care anymore because you 've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula do to tick someone off THIS badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie.<br / >"	0
"I love movies , and I 'll watch any movie all the way through , just to give it a chance . I can finally say that I found a movie I ca n't watch all the way through . The acting is terribly stale and monotone , the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother 's basement with minimal software , and ..... the long scenes of just ... walking ! ! ! ! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG ! ! ! I did n't even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD . The scenes with the aliens are very short . Ummm , instead of naming this "" War of the Worlds "" , lets name this "" War of the Walking Long Distances "" . This cost 5 million dollars to make ! What they spend the money on , the dramatic opening song?Oh , but on a positive note , one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people . That 's hilarious , not because people are dying , but because when they turn to skeletons , they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.So .... like I said , if you are a fan of boring , stale , action - less movies , here is one for you DVD collection . But I did n't write this for you , I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie . It is not worth your time or money < br />I know this is by the book , but the book is n't that long , and I 'm a complete book worm / nerd / geek / whatever , but why ? Just get the Steven Spielberg version , it 's not all that good , but it 's 10 times better than this ! ! < br />I give this a BIG , FAT ZERO out of 10 ."	0
"I rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a kid . It was not . I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting , poor character development , and most of all , failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog . In this version ... the "" Dog of Flanders "" is just a cute "" aside "" to the movie . Get the 1959 version !"	0
A team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the Crown of the Queen of Sheeba . From Egypt , the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco . But it wo n't be an easy journey . There are plenty of would - be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown . Fortunately for all involved , Mr. Moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey . However , that does n't mean someone wo n't try to get their hands on the treasure.After the disappointment of Mr. Moto 's Gamble , I went into Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation hoping for the best , but , admittedly , fearing the worst . But within the first 10 seconds of the film , I knew I would find it more enjoyable . I 'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in Egypt . And seeing Moto disguised as a German archaeologist ( Imagine that , Peter Lorre playing a German ? ) , the beginning scenes really drew me in . While the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic San Francisco , it remained just as enjoyable . Dark , sinister characters lurking in the rainy night ; gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero 's head ; sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them ; and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that I love . And Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation 's got 'em all . A couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable Lionel Atwill in a nice little role , comic relief from G.P. Huntley that 's actually funny , and a return to form for Mr. Moto . I 've already mentioned his disguise in the movie 's opening scenes , well the athletic Moto comes out near the film 's finale . Moto is a like a Whirling Dervish of activity as he goes after his prey . All this and I have n't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by Lorre . Any way you look at it , Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation is a winner.As much as I hate that the Mr. Moto series had to end after this installment , it 's understandable when you think about it . WWII was just around the corner . And after Pearl Harbor , a movie with a Japanese hero would n't have gone over very well . At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note .	1
I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old , beginning with Childs Play . Since then , I have seen good horror movies and bad , but this is without question , the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen ! The actors did all they could with the material . The plot was just idiotic . Plus , it was just all gore . I can stomach a lot of blood , but that was just ridiculous ! In one of the scenes , a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines ! Plain Stupid ! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made . The end of it is just dumb . But then again , it goes with the rest of it ! At the end , when the girl gets away from the cannibal / ancestor , she receives help from a old lady . The old lady is making tea , but when she turns around to talk to the girl , the girl attacks her ! She turned into a cannibal ! Retarded movie .	0
The planning episodes were a bit dull , but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch . The reason why I call it the most realistic reality show is because , much to my surprise , Charley fell out of the race relatively early . When his hands were sore , I expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix , but instead he actually quit the race . The most anxious moment of the show must 've been when Max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food ! The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it . Overall , not as great as the Long Way Round , but definitely an interesting watch , as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world .	1
Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy . Now most of the rest of the film was okay . It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others . The problem is n't with direction , acting or anything technical . The movie is just destroyed in the third act . Why ? The murders , twists , turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL ? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that ? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history . For all the complaints about Burton 's Planet of the Apes , THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever . What a let down .	0
This will be best known for the Ferrari that was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion.Tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who could n't see the numbers . Largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck . This is not a good movie , but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film is n't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it.Misogynistic , despite the fact one of the leads is a woman , this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls . Want evidence ? There are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the Sports illustrated swimsuit DVD.Avoid this movie at all costs	0
"Mary Pickford often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role . Well said ! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced , she not only had to purchase the rights from Adolph Zukor but even give him credit on the film 's main title card . Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning . Indeed , in my opinion , the movie itself rates as one the all - time great experiences of silent cinema.True , director John S. Robertson does n't move his camera an inch from start to finish , but in Robertson 's skillful hands this affectation not only does n't matter but is probably more effective . A creative artist of the first rank , Robertson is a master of pace , camera angles and montage . He has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players . Jean Hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive , it 's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly Dr Christian ; while Lloyd Hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career . True , it 's probably not the way Mrs White intended , but it serves the plot admirably , as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother - in - law ! Needless to say , this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by Jack Ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author 's trenchant attack on smug , middle - class Christianity . Notice how the well - washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption , but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer . This is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented.""Tess "" also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress , Gloria Hope , whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema . She married Lloyd Hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children . Lloyd Hughes died in 1958 , but she lived until 1976 , easily contactable in Pasadena , but I bet no - one had the brains to interview her . Another opportunity lost ! < br />To me , Forrest Robinson only made a middling impression as Skinner . I thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this : He usually played priests or judges ! But David Torrence as usual was superb.In all , an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values ."	1
I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day , after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven . Not really a fan of either star , I still wanted to see it because I 'm a huge thriller fan.I was not disappointed . The acting was superb , especially from the two young boys . Usually I loathe child actors , but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent . Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too . It was beautifully shot.One must also note the plot twists . The three twists at the end hit hard and fast , and I did n't see them coming . The final twist of the film , coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed , gives me chills to this day , even though I 've re - watched the film so many times.A true gem .	1
Probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful , dramatic episode ( in this case , the superb Balance of Terror ) with a lighter affair , Shore Leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the Star Trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci - fi , and while the formula is n't quite right yet in this entry ( the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles , in Season 2 ) , the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.Diverting from the show 's tradition , the Enterprise is n't on any proper mission in this episode . Instead , Kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty : a well deserved break after three months of incessant work . The Earth - like planet ( a budget - related fact ) is very appealing , but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens : Dr. McCoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of Lewis Carroll 's work . Soon , other people begin experiencing similar things : a woman meets a Don Juan - like character , Sulu has a run - in with a samurai , and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past , in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the Academy . Throw in a freakishly real - looking tiger , and it 's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what 's going on before anybody gets hurt.The idea is a classic one : idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly . The episode 's humorous take on the topic is rather successful , were n't it for a dark turn of events that does n't sit well with the rest ( of course , everything works out fine again come the end ) and the cast 's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves ( most notably , and ironically , the otherwise hilarious William Shatner ) . And yet Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new , previously unseen things : the definition of Star Trek 's success.7,5/10	1
Just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion . Every line , every phrase , every picture is exactly in place and Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna are just THE cool shrink and the sleazy con - man , so well cast . 10 out of 10 !	1
No , this is not no Alice fairy tale my friends ! This ` Wonderland ' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred back in 80 's California . At the center of this bloodbath was no other than ` Johnny Wad ' himself . Yes , John Holmes ! Daddy ding - dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine . Besides being a legendary adult film actor , Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies . Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes , but for once this Holmes character did not milk it through completely . The film possesses a ` who 's who ' of supporting players : Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs , Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes life , and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur . These characters do play integral parts , directly or indirectly , in the ` Wonderland ' murders . Out of this support group , it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce & impressive as the ardent Ron Launius . Lucas is gradually escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in ` A Beautiful Mind ' & ` Sweet Home Alabama ' . Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes , just like Holmes ' famous organ . Holmes was eventually acquitted of the ` Wonderland ' murders . He died of complications from the Aids virus . ` Wonderland ' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night , and if Holmes really laid out his weapon . Oops ! Wrong Holmes movie ! Ok ! That is enough before I get ` penislized ' I mean penalized . Bye Holmies ! * * * Average	1
"I saw "" Myra Breckinridge "" when it first came out in 1970 . I was a healthy 20-year - old at the time , who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh . On top of that , I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny . I saw the movie at a local drive - in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe I 'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie . It was n't "" smart "" or "" trendy "" , it was gross and sloppy . All the actors were tone deaf and the director did n't have the slightest idea what he was doing . The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history . As one reviewer here said , her role had nothing to do with the movie or book . Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud , which would never do for the legendary Ms. West . Oh no , the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up , very believable from a 77-year - old woman who looks every DAY of her age . I could go on , but why ? It was an awful movie.Bluto"	0
Etienne Girardot is just a character actor -- the sort of person people almost never would know by name . However , he once again plays the coroner -- one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once . I 've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air . This film also is great to watch because in addition to Girardot , there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride -- including Grant Mitchell , Gene Lockhart , Henry Walthal , Kent Smith , H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton . This is quite an impressive cast , and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce.These great character actors are one of the big reasons I love these old B - movies . While the mystery itself is rarely that terrific , because of the breezy writing and acting , the films really satisfy . As for this film , Vance is played wonderfully by Lowe but , like I said , the mystery itself is only an after - thought -- with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides . Unfortunately , you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort -- I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I COULD do anything like the evil guy could do in the film , I would have done it ! Used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets ! ! < br />Overall , while not the best Philo Vance film , it was very good and it 's a darn shame Lowe only played this role once . In fact , aside from William Powell ( who played Vance five times ) , the series was hindered by a long , long succession of actors such as Basil Rathbone , Wilfred Hyde - White and Warren William ( and many others ) playing Vance . This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series -- just too many different actors playing the leading man.Well worth seeing and exciting -- though also quite impossible .	1
Alan Rudolph is a so - so director , without that special touch . As an example , there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife . Rudolph squandered it . The camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices , with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms . You get the idea of their desolation and isolation , but not much more . The lighting , the colors , the body language , the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon . If I were directing , I would have spent all day , if necessary , to get that shot right . That 's the beauty and power of film : it can express so much , whole lives , in a matter of seconds < br />The shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on . The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle , should have stomped and shuffled her feet , should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention . < br />Campbell did n't deliver . He plays a uncommunicative man , true , but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice , gesture , body movement , the film relies on voice - over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter - ego , played by Denis Leary .	0
A film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war , when a Spanish Republican , sent by his soon to be overthrown government , ( Charles Boyer ) infiltrates himself into England looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in Spain . He upsets the locals , getting convincingly beaten in one scene , and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood . Notwithstanding socio - economic hierarchy , xenophobia , and world politics , this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre , and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by James Wong Howe , and manages more than once to get under your skin .	1
"This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth . Although it has a lot to say about power , jealousy and ambition ( the themes of Macbeth ) in our modern world , the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously . Recognizable actors such as John Glover , Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles , but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the "" murder "" of Banquo ( John Elsen ) is rehearsed . Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre , but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film ."	1
FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s ( the origins of Off Off Broadway ) . Though it 's not for everyone , it is a genuinely brilliant , darkly funny , even more often deeply disturbing tale about love , sex , personal liberty , and revenge , a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution . The story is not about being gay , though -- it 's about love and sex that do n't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate . On the surface , it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig , but like any great fable , it 's not really about animals , it 's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America.The stage version won international acclaim in its original production , it toured the U.S. and Europe , and with others of its kind , influenced almost all theatre that came after it . Luckily , we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived , with the original cast and original director , Tom O'Horgan ( who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).This is not a mainstream , easy - to - take , studio film -- this is an aggressive , unsettling , glorious , deeply emotional , wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you 'll never forget . And it just might change the way you see the world ...	1
"This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR . It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie "" Misery ( 1990 ) "" . I can not understand how this movie got a 5.2 score , because it has no story what so ever , and when the movie finally ended , I was relieved.This movie should have been released as a short - movie instead .. to much time is spent on the same thing . And as in every bad movie , everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10 - 15 minutes time span ... So , before you decide to watch this movie , be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control , because you are going to do whole lot of fast - forwarding ... do n't worry , you wo nt miss anything important ."	0
An enjoyable game , which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability . Staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today . Also , the narration and animated scenes used ( though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the Nintendo 64 version ) use full advantage of the platforms ' capabilities .	1
I see a lot of people liked this movie . To me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class . From the time Lindsey Price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable . I kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere.First we have the widowed young father . Cliché # 1 movies / TV always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl , or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children . Starting from from My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads . These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows.Cliché # 2 When a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie . And will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead < br />Cliché # 3 If the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of Latino origin . And they must be illegal . Apparently there are no legal Latino 's and illegal Europeans , unless if there is a IRA element involved.Cliché # 4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country . In this case he was a Profesor who made 200 per month . And the said highly educated Latino must now act like he has n't brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over.Cliché # 5 The crime the person committed really was n't a crime but a accident . But because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick.Cliché # 6 One never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime , but some poor little cute kid . This is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie , and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents.Cliché # 7 Name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie . Even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police Force . Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind right away . And the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold.Cliché # 8 Let 's go and round up some unemployed Soap Stars . Now I like Lindsey Price . But Susan Haskell IMO can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on One Life To Live as Marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth . It use to get me sea sick . She might be anchored on land better now , but she still can not act.The movie might have been more insightful if it was n't filled with clichés . I do n't think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good . But this was just bad.***SPOILER * * * * Now I am not going to spoil the ending . Oh heck I will because I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie . It involves Cliché # 6 and # 7 . Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming . The father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran , who all of a sudden is very upset . You would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake . When she did n't . Now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him . Guess what happen to her ? Times up , she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father ! ! Come on ! You all knew that was going to happen , because she is a replacement child ! ! That is why she did not go and live with the Lindey Price character . < br />This movie was a insult as far as I was concerned . Because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one . The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars , the little girl , who I thought was very good and Lindsey Price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it . My advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck	0
"I recently watched the first Guinea Pig film , The Devil 's Experiment , and I must admit to being disappointed.This film is invariably included in any list of the "" nastiest "" films and maybe I was expecting more because of the hype . The truth is though , I do n't rate it.If I 'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true ( "" I found this tape ... "" ) , I might have been a bit disturbed by it , thinking it was real . Even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though , I think I 'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't.Throughout the film , the girl 's reactions to what is being done to her just are n't what they should be . She should be screaming like a banshee in pain . The fact that she is n't means that it 's obviously not real . I would n't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting , the film would be more disturbing.And then there are the notorious scenes : nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand . The hot oil , maggots and innards just did n't bother me . I 'm not saying I 'm "" hard "" ; just that I was n't able to suspend my disbelief , partly because of the girl 's inaction.The scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber . And the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more . I did n't want to look away and neither did I feel nauseous.Perhaps it 's because the film is twenty - odd years old , or perhaps I 'm just jaded . The truth is , I did n't find this film at all disturbing.It 's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters , story etc . and just leaving the torture , it works on some levels . As a disturbing piece of film though , it did n't work for me at least.I watched Guinea Pig with my wife , who is of the "" it 's just a film "" bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about . We got to discussing why I watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film . She said that she did n't think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that . I played her the fire extinguisher scene from Irreversible and she was indeed disturbed.I'm not sure I have a point , other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non - horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb ."	0
This work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs . This film never tries to tone it down , cotton candy - ize , or soft soap the angst , confusion , and pain of what these guys live with . That is its strength , I think.But more so , the performances are fantastic , with well conceived and delivered dialog , which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience . The characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what 's on their mind - what 's in their hearts.I found it plodding , but enjoyable.It rates a 6.6/10 from ... the Fiend : .	1
"It appears that there 's no middle ground on this movie ! Most of it takes place in a dream and , like most dreams , it 's often foolish and illogical . It 's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances , especially by our angel.Jeanette 's deadpan , unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious , and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight . At one point , she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen , followed by the final trio of Faust ( holding a lapdog , for some strange reason ) , then "" Aloha Oe "" on the beach ! < br />It 's a surreal comedy -- tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove ."	1
"This movie really is a mixed bag . On the one hand , the story and concept of the movie are really good , tense and have some nice plot twists in it . But than again on the other hand , it all is told very slow , without style and uninvolved . Still I regard "" Just Cause "" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role . I mean , he is n't really that believable as a the main ' hero ' and father of a young daughter ( played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson by the way ) and husband of Kate Capshaw . I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it . However Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does . But he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like Laurence Fishburne , Blair Underwood , Ned Beatty , Hope Lange , Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris . All actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time , which is a real shame , as well as a missed opportunity . Especially Ed Harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer . He 's truly chilling and acting superbly . Normally he does n't play this ruthless , chilling sort of roles in movies , so he really surprises with his role in this one . His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie . However due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic , none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant.It really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential . Arne Glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times . Because of this , we as viewers , never really get involved with the story or any of it 's characters.It really is too bad , for "" Just Cause "" had more than enough potential . A fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems . The cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller , that will probably still please the fan of the genre . It however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style , or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre.7/10"	1
"The film - school intellects can drool all they want about the important ( imagined ) meaning of this film , but it 's just that : intellectual drool . This film is creatively bankrupt , and some mistake it 's endless self - indulgent wanking as substance . Yeah . < br />Obviously Godard was n't a Stones fan . Too bad , because this could have been great . He 's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a True Detective mag or some such crap . < br />Then there 's the endless shots of what looks like 60 's librarians spray - painting words on people 's cars . And then there 's the seemingly neverending "" interview "" where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions . There 's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book , which goes on for , oh , only about 20 minutes . And black panthers or something in a junkyard.It almost sounds intriguing ? Well , it 's not.But for unwashed film - school hipsters who do n't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the Stones bringing Sympathy for the Devil into the world and would rather hear some English guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag 's , this film 's a real winner!More accurately ... maybe Godard just blows ."	0
"In one word ... abysmal . I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women , otherwise forget it . Corman 's worst effort , bar none . Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast . I can not believe that this is now going to be on DVD ( as of 2/15/05 ) with "" Wild In The Streets "" - another retro stinker . I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold , decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some , scanned the digital channels ... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B - movie sci - fi , hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks . It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast , I thought ... why not ? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to my day.Only after viewing it , I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly - awakened brain . I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old ( I 'm 45 ) , back in the early / mid - seventies at the Sombrero , a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked . Acting : dreadful , story : awful , cinematography : nearly - awful , music : terrible , sound : horrendous , directing : a joke . If you choose to watch this after my warning , remember ... "" I told you so .

Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie . It was decent and entertaining , while still being pretty funny . There were a few cliché 's , but I found most stuff fresh . At first I did n't think it was going to be good at all , when it started out . If you can get past the first 20 minutes though , the movie starts getting more interesting . This film was n't burst out in laughter hilarious , and was n't OH MY GOSH wonderful . It was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was . I do n't see how this movie was bad . It 's rating is just a bit too low . I could 've dealt with a 5.5,but a 4.8?Also , giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful . It was pretty good , and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1,which is what most people gave it .	1
"Oh , CGI . A blessing when used properly . A sin with it 's used by people who have no idea what their doing . Sadly , that 's not the only thing that 's used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip - off.Ok , anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things . 1 : I like low - budget horror movies . And 2 : If there is a cute guy in said low - budget movie , I 'll usually point them out . So , let 's just get this out of the way right now . This is one low - budget horror movie I did n't like . The acting , for the most part , is horrible , effects laughable , and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I 've witnessed this year . As far as the resident cute boy ... Dax Miller ( Bog ) wins that prize hands down . This boy is hot ! And surprisingly , he 's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt ... he can actually act ( well , as much as he can in this odious film ) . Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way , let 's get on with it.In Cliff Notes version , here 's the story ( do n't worry , I 'll try not to give anything away) ... A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers ( established cute boy and his buddy ) who surf with sharks . Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island . Croc shows up , mayhem ensues , and people are eaten . Roll end credits.As I said earlier , this film pretty much blows . It started pretty well , but soon devolved into being silly and stupid . A main character becomes lunch ( in a rather humorous way ) , and our remaining heros utter one - liners at the victims expense . Also , if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water , what 's with all the sharks around ? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat , I do n't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around . The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see . The CGI is horrendous , and they 've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs . Attention , filmmakers . National Geographic . Discovery Store . The Croc Hunter . They know what crocodiles look like . You obviously did n't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film . And what 's with the pirate / drug pusher gang ? Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman 's top ? < br />It 's funny how we get little sub - genres in the movie world . With Alligator and it 's sequels , Lake Placid , Crocodile , and now Blood Surf , it now looks like "" over - sized crocodile / alligator "" movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster . Alligator was good . Lake Placid was good . I even thought Tobe Hooper 's Crocodile was good . Blood Surf , sucked.My grade : D-"	0
"When we started watching this series on cable , I had no idea how addictive it would be . Even when you hate a character , you hold back because they are so beautifully developed , you can almost understand why they react to frustration , fear , greed or temptation the way they do . It 's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher 's learning curves.I ca n't understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher 's abuse of her , verbally , physically and emotionally , but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior . Carmella has a dream house , endless supply of expensive things , but I 'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not . That 's why I watch.It does n't matter how many times you watch an episode , you can find something you missed the first five times . We even watch episodes out of sequence ( watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language , A&E with language censored , reruns on the Movie Network ) - whenever they 're on , we 're there . We 've been totally spoiled now.I also love the Malaprop 's . "" An albacore around my neck "" is my favorite of Johnny Boy . When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary , it is a sign that I should get a life . I will when the series ends , and I have collected all the DVD 's , and put the collection in my will ."	1
First of all , I do n't understand why some people find this movie so anti - american . Sure , there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly , like at the segments of Youssef Chahine , Ken Loach and , to a certain extent , Mira Nair . But come on , they are n't naive accusations ; instead , they are based on real and documented facts , and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this , for example.But returning to the film itself , what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it . We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event ; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day ; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this , with dignity or frustration ; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th . Thus , what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks , and this may make some people infuriated ; but this is the world where we live , and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies , regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.Finally , I think it 's a shame that there is n't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America . It 's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened , and this movie could give some clues to them . This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future , and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today .	1
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! I saw it at the Toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time . Completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Steer clear .	0
Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty - somethings whose characters are all unlikable , and an iguana - like man - lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein . On the positive side , the movie does not skimp on showing the monster . There 's no peek - a - boo shots , or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like ; he 's right out there folks . Unfortunately , the design and construction are n't that inspired . A little bit of mystery might have helped . Mind you , I 've seen far worse , but if you 're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick , your monster better look damn good . < br />Spoiler Ahead!!!Oh , and there 's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . This came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script . As for the acting ; well let 's just say it was n't painfully bad , but I do n't expect we 'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings.Gore quotient : 2 out of 5 ; Nudity quotient : 1 out of 5 ; Intelligence quotient : Negligible	0
Jane Eyre _ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it . I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about . This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.The whole ' red room ' is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in . In the book the ' red room ' is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane 's life . Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I 'm sure she was happy to die and leave early . In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie.Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it .	0
"I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it . Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film . He failed thank God.The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin wo n't like her because she 's ugly . The film is just bad for so many reasons . The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits : ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit . Those two scenes made me cringe ! Janeane 's character is sickeningly arrogant ( and guessing from her role as stand - up "" comedienne "" and arch - feminist is in real life too ) . She claims that the film is "" anti - feminist "" when in fact it 's just realistic . Men more often than not go for looks over personality . It 's interesting to note her hypocrisy too . She 'd been a feminist and "" comedienne "" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad . I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film . I mean come on ! She acted in it for Heaven 's sake ! What this film was really was anti - men if anything . It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman 's character Noelle.There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin 's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure . Is that the best the script writers could come up with ? Blimey they 've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made . There 's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is . The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo is n't ugly but is actually beautiful . Erm was I watching the same film as they were ? She 's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one . Although having said that , I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well : she 's lanky and gaunt looking.I guarantee three things about this film if you 've never watched it:You will know what the ending will be;You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;You will be bored after ten minutes.Watch at your own peril ."	0
"Drones , ethnic drumming , bad synthesizer piping , children singing . The most patronizing "" world music "" imaginable . This is a tourist film , and a lousy one . What really kills it is the incoherent sequences . India , Egypt , South America , Africa , etc , etc . No transitions , no visual explanation of why we 're suddenly ten thousand miles away , no ideas expressed in images . Just a bunch of footage of third - worlders with "" baskets on their heads "" as another reviewer said . Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning . If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video , all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot , and film in Mexico . That would have been a much better setting for "" life in transformation . ""But no . What they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind - deadeningly overcranked filter shots . The only thing to recommend this film is that it does n't suck quite as much as Naqoyqatsi.RstJ"	0
A delightful little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag convertible and ends on a dockside in Liverpool . It 's all thrills and spills as the ex - spy has to restart his career just as he 's getting some serious R & R cataloguing butterflies ( how British is that?).Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons frolic from London to Newcastle - upon - Tyne to Liverpool ( via Ullswater ) - he 's just been thrown out of MI5 or something , and she , you guessed it , is on the run , wrongly accused of murder . There 's seedy docks , rolling Lake District hills , sheep , country pubs , coppers getting lost , waterfalls , a bunch of amateur cyclists , rooftop chases , and lots of Chinamen ( do n't ask ) , and it 's all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ...  .. and a smashing example of British Noir ...	1
I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era . I do think it should have dealt with more of the Afro American issue but I think it cover a lot in the program . It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down . I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war . I went to school with guys who came back . Some had changed more than others and some not so much . It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough . Live through it and then make comments . I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job . Thank you for a trip ( sad and good ) down memory lane .	1
Did anybody succeed in getting in this movie?It 's a total mess to me : a vague historical / sentimental context instead of a plot , a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours!Shame on those who wasted money here .	0
The 40 Year Old Virgin , is about Andy Stitzer , a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and does n't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women . Some of his co - workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy , is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity . One day in the store Andy , meets a woman named Trish , who gives him her phone number and eventually Andy , works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but Andy , is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to Trish , much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward . The 40 Year Old Virgin , has good direction , a good script , good comedic performances by the whole cast , good cinematography and good film editing . The film stars and is co - written by Steve Carell , who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too . I was very pleasantly surprised with this film . It is sweet , funny , entertaining , fun , enjoyable , clever , good natured and a good time . This film is just as good as this year 's Wedding Crashers , and both films are two of the best comedies I have seen in awhile . The 40 Year Old Virgin , really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun . One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year .	1
"I don't'know ... maybe it 's because I 'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much . Too much love for the music , too much parties , too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters ( come on , it 's not so sad ) and the aspect of the city shown by the director . Everything looks too fake to me : the families , the relationships , the music , the "" happiness "" . It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture . I must be honest : it did seduce me a little , but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music , sex and parties ? I 'm not that stupid : what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea , profound sadness and STDs ? I liked the scene with Caridad 's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people ."	0
Jack Frost is Really a Cool Movie . I Mean .... Its Funny . Its Violent . and Very Enjoyable . Most People Say that it Is B Rated , But That Could n't be Farther from the truth . It has Great Special Effects and Good Acting . The Only Weird thing is of Course , The Killer Snowman . I Think this Movie was Actually one of The Best Films of the Late - Nineties . Most Films these Days lack the Criteria of A Clive Barker Master Piece . That is , Be Original and Give the Viewer What they Do not Expect . Jack Frost is Very Cool . 10 out of 10 . Grade : A+ . Ed Also Recommends The Movie Uncle Sam to Fans of Jack Frost .	1
A series of shorts spoofing dumb TV shows , Groove Tube hits and misses a lot . Overall , I do really like this movie . Unfortunately , a couple of the segments are totally boring . A few really great clips make up for this . A predecessor to such classics like Kentucky Fried Movie .	1
Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated Man when it premiered on TV back in December of 2000.An infectious disease expert ( William Hurt ) looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them . Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace . I 'm not sure where exactly , all I know is it takes place somewhere in that area . Anyway , because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory , they are forced to lay off most of their workers . One of them , a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller ( played Peter Weller , best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop ) goes in there and demands that they give him his job back . He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support . So he goes in there , a fight breaks out , and some things get knocked over , dangerous things . It 's soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen . In fact it 's so deadly , one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds . Soon word gets out and the disease expert ( Hurt ) is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an American reporter . Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire Russian population.Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down . We have a disturbed person ( Weller here , Michael Douglas in Falling Down ) who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process . Next we have a hero - type person ( Hurt here , Robert Duvall in Falling Down ) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist.Contaminated Man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances.8/10	1
I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies . Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays . But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie . Oh well I thought it was good so I think that every one should see this movie . If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel . I give Soldier * * * 1/2 out of * * * * *	1
A lot of people hated this movie , but that I blame on two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American Pie movies . and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously.This one I found was the best one out of all six , and I absolutely love Dwight . The plot is predictable , I 'll say that , but then what teen comedy ISN'T ? Road Trip , Dirty Deeds etc etc , they are all incredibly predictable , but still goddamn funny ! I say this is worth watching , I love it , I find it hilarious . Just do n't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it 's nothing alike.After watching Naked Mile and this one , it became obvious that all the American Pie movies were about , and only about , the Stiflers . Which is FINE by me.Watch . Enjoy . Love . xD	1
"John Huston 's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor 's book than I could have imagined . From the utterly terrible acting performances ( and do n't you , "" Oh that was done on purpose , you just do n't get it "" me ! ) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files , this film was revolting . I viewed it with no ill - will at the outset , and , in fact , expected a pleasant experience . But the misrepresentation of the southern characters , from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting , comedic way their faith was portrayed , was inexcusable . Right down to it 's end , which was completely devoid of any character sentiment , it failed in every place that O'Connor 's book shined and resonated . The actors portraying the "" southern "" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot - dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather . The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty 's lively and dead - on representation of Hoover Shoates , a religious con - artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities . O'Connor 's powerful book is most well - known for it 's creepy , religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of "" Faith "" . Mr. Huston 's film is a shameful mockery of the author 's intentions , as they are understood by me and most of her fans , if I may be so bold as to say so . While I acknowledge that I ca n't know exactly what the author wished to convey , I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan . If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did , I would have thrown it in the trash . For Flannery 's sake , and mine , I forgive you , John Huston . The forgetting .... that will take some time ."	0
"Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws ? Orca is n't exactly a "" Jaws rip off "" but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws 's success . First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie , not terrible but definitely not good , average at best.The plot is basically a male killer whale ( orca ) after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge . I could n't stand to watch this movie again . The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director , producers , and writers were almost talentless.As for the acting , it was very average and believable , however the actual characters are n't the least bit likable . The effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good.The violence is confusing , bloody , and not recommended for more sensitive people . The music is overdone and very loud , drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times . I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale ( killer whales do n't mate with only one mate as depicted in Orca).Overall this movie was bad / poor in my opinion , because of the reasons listed above . Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so I 'm not going to bash this movie and I can understand why some people may like it.My Rating : 3.5/10 ( but for its concept possibly a 5/10 )"	0
You 'll notice by the stars I 've given this GREAT film that ' ... before you see it the first time , ' is implied . I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week ( and last ) was a very slow rental experience ( not much great coming in ) . I 'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too . Still , it did.This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you do n't have a large budget . It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark ; just enough . The entire film is you ( the viewer ) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns . I would have given this film 10/10 , however some of the shots were pretty fake looking . I do n't hold that against this film too much , but I do n't think it deserves a perfect score.Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious ( as always ) . I think she 's pretty underrated as a serious talent . Nevermind her beauty ( which is difficult ) , she really takes her roles seriously and does n't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion . And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed , as well.Jeremy Northam does really well , at first , as quite a geeky corporate rat , willing to run through any maze to prove himself . However , as he changes throughout the film , it 's like night and day . I know some fans of Clive Owen , Jude Law , or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this , but Northam would / could / should fit that bill . He 's suave and cultured . He 's got a great Bond posture and voice . I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it , and rather down - to - Earth , as well.Great film and definitely this movie - buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .	1
This movie tries hard , but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series , that I am sure people do remember with fondness . Although I am 17 , I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun . Sadly , this movie does little justice to the series.The special effects are rather substandard , and this was n't helped by the flat camera - work . The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour . Other films with under - par scripting are Home Alone 4 , Cat in the Hat , Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.Now I will say I liked the idea of the story , but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early , and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy . And I was annoyed by the talking suit , despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd , Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah , all very talented actors . Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before , but he did n't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing , and Elizabeth Hurley 's character sadly came across as useless . Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored , and I liked the idea of her being the love interest , but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them ) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative . Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better , and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit , and I am fond of Back To The Future ) but he was given little to work with , and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.Overall , as much I wanted to like this movie , I was left unimpressed . Instead of being fun , it came across as pointless , and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential , with some talented actors and a good idea , but wasted with poor execution . 1/10 Bethany Cox	0
"This movie is stuffed full of stock Horror movie goodies : chained lunatics , pre - meditated murder , a mad ( vaguely lesbian ) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement , poisoning , spooky castles , werewolves ( male and female ) , adultery , slain lovers , Tibetan mystics , the half - man / half - plant victim of some unnamed experiment , grave robbing , mind control , walled up bodies , a car crash on a lonely road , electrocution , knights in armour - the lot , all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst Foley work ever done.The script is incomprehensible ( even by badly dubbed Spanish Horror movie standards ) and some of the editing is just bizarre . In one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed : "" That is fantastical . I do not understand . Explain to me again how this is ... "" exposition scenes that litter this movie , there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl 's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist 's "" Mwahaha ! All your werewolfs belong mine ! "" speech . Though why they went to the bother I do n't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print I saw.The Director was , according to one interview with the star , drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it . It is an incoherent mess . It 's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man ( made 4 years earlier , featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - IS there a word in Spanish for "" Continuity "" ? ) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get - up ambling about in long shot.The music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music , to bosannova , to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded . ( Thinking about it , it might not have been a duet . It might have been a solo . The piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other . ) < br />This is one of the most bewilderedly trance - state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me . Enjoy.Favourite line : "" Ilona ! This madness and perversity will turn against you ! "" How true.Favourite shot : The lover , discovering his girlfriend slain , dropping the candle in a cartoon - like demonstration of surprise . Rank amateur directing there ."	1
From the very beginning , the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed , that the outcome is entirely predictable . Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters , incorporating character arcs , and three act structure . In this film you will find none of that . The police are the baddies , and consequently are shown as shallow , incompetent and cowards . It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain . The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse , but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence . We see him walk through the door of a gaol , but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression . I found the film a real chore to watch . It is the direction for modern films , and this one put me off watching any more .	0
"As seems to be the general gist of these comments , the film has some stunning animation ( I watched it on blu - ray ) but it really falls short of any real depth.Firstly the characters are all pretty dull . I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito , Toola and the main antagonist Shunack . However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking ( Laputa being my favourite animé , original Engilsh dub ) . The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly , leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected ( she loves Agito , who seems oblivious of this ) . However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more "" happy "" . < br />There is also a serious lack of explanation . Like who are the druids really ? Are they people ? and who are the weird women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest ? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers . The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this . It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids.And who does call Toola ? why bother with this if it wo nt be explained?I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki . I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I had n't bought it . My advice ? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare , but borrow it , or buy it cheap ! Perhaps if your new to animé films and do n't have much to go by you will enjoy it . It certainly is visually pleasing ."	0
"When you come across a gem of a movie like this , you realize why the ' 80s were the greatest decade to live thru . The rock music ruled , & so did movies ... especially horror movies . Filmmakers knew how to entertain us , & "" Trick or Treat "" is evident to this . When rocker Sammi Curr , who was most likely written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless , dies in a hotel fire , his # 1 fan Eddie , is distraught . He goes to friend & local dj Nuke ( Gene Simmons ) for support . Nuke gives him a copy of the very last recording that Sammi made ; this is the only copy available . It was given to the radio station to be played live Halloween night . When Eddie plays it , it somehow brings back Sammi . He helps Eddie with the bullies at school , but then goes out of control . It is definitely one great movie . The bad thing is , this movie is out of print . I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it off of eBay . You should too ... $$ well spent !"	1
one of the best low budget movies from Germany ! is this is the dark side of new age ? if you believe in esoteric , please do n't watch this movie ! it blows all your positive fantasies away . this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror . i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon ! Andreas Marschall 's first film is just the beginning of a new area , making movies with a few euros ! i 'm waiting for the second hit !	1
"I really liked the movie . I remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book.I was kid - sitting for a boy and a girl , ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie . But happily , at the end , she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out.There were some great laugh - out - loud moments and the movie was not as "" gross "" as I expected it would be ... tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross - o - meter ... < br />The only thing I can not figure out is why they had to have the "" dilly "" line in there that was done by Woody in reference to his private part ... that to me was the only shocker moment ( and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie ) ... I have no clue why that was put in the movie ; it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock / gasp factor ... other than that , a pretty good movie . Nice to see the "" Pepsi "" girl all grown up ."	1
"Only a handful of the segments are engaging here . A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking . One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes its point , twist by twist until the final shot overplays things . < br />The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris . The others are so scatter - shot in theme , tone , volition & production that you may as well be watching "" The Years Best Commercials , 2006 . "" It 's really all over the place . It does n't develop over it 's running time , and nothing reigns the directors in . No construct successfully joins the pieces ... tedium sets in . I 'm at the one hour , twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb , over - commercial , overproduced vampire shtick . It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic . Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment ( Uh , thanks J & E for ruining another movie ) and then makes way too many appearances . The point of being in Paris is that you do n't need make - believe crap to make your days extraordinary . Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director ? Has there ever been a genre more over - represented than the vampire film . Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless . The transitions get lost . This does n't feel intentional , it feels sloppy ."	0
""" The Garden of Allah "" is a prime example of "" popular women 's literature "" , turn of the XXth century style , combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado - masochistic bite of Catholic guilt . Just as Jane Eyre could n't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins , or the heroine of "" Rebecca "" could n't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife ( and her castle burned down around her ) , or poor Psyche could n't leave well enough alone and had to extract Cupid 's secret at all costs , Domini , the devout Catholic heroine of this piece of tripe , can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows . Like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours , this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book : basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one 's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late . The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act . It is Paul Claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards . Oh well ... It could have been much worse and it often was ... Without the religious overtones , the film 's plot is that of your basic porn flick : Oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic , shapely but naive Catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery , all passion spent , leaving her to clean up his mess . And I really resent another commentator 's comparison with Anatole France 's "" Thais "" , a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression , some of which transpired in Massenet 's opera of the same name , thankfully.But what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism , of course , is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering , vibrant life . Imperishable Technicolor photography that will outlive us all , a truckload of worthy character actors ( including one cute dog ) , a music score by Max Steiner that seems determined to accomplish the "" composed film "" that Michael Powell ( who , ironically , had a bit part in the 1927 silent version ) always dreamed about , tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic , operatic exoticism , a dream - like atmosphere where material considerations are no object , characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next , dialog is sparse , vague and suggestive , the art direction is close to celestial , flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent , the heroine 's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats , saints , doomed but horny sinners , mystics or poets.Ahh ... Hollywood ! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable . The bit rate is very high throughout , the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to Max Steiner 's score and to Boyer 's penultimate confession.A historical note on this sort of "" women 's subject "" : The following year ( 1937 ) , Julien Duvivier , visibly inspired by "" The Garden of Allah "" , directed "" Carnet de Bal "" , where a very similar clothes - horse butter - won't - melt - in - her - mouth heroine ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic Alpine lakeside villa ) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book . She finds them all in time , only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood , overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences . It was Duvivier 's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later ."	1
"Anita and Me seems to be little more than an excuse for Meera Syal , the author of the novel and screenplay , to air her prejudices , grievances and general antipathy towards the English . The general sentiment of Indian superiority over the English in this film is foul.The English people in this film are portrayed as overweight , violent , foul - mouthed , promiscuous , engaging in child neglect , stupid , uneducated , racist , ugly , eating poor food , and dim - witted -- tellingly , only by turning to Indian culture can the local priest be "" redeemed "" at the end of the film.By contrast , the Indian family are beautiful , clever , educated , can speak many languages , are caring and loving parents , and grammar - school fodder . The film is so insidiously prejudicial that I am astonished the BBC funded it at all . Had it been the other way round , an English family in an Indian community depicted this way , the film would have been seen as racist.There were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead , I thought it would lodge in my hairline . First , the gossip scene between the women at the Divali celebration -- undertext : the English are dirty and promiscuous -- and the men -- undertext : English women are prostitutes . Second , the meal with Anita where Neema 's family lie to her about cutlery -- undertext : the English are so stupid , you can make them do anything.But the underlying contempt towards anything English -- even English weddings are an object of scorn -- is evident all the way through the film . The character of Anita was drawn so appallingly -- almost the fallen woman trope -- that I finished the film feeling angry.This is not a "" Bend it like Beckham "" where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community 's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community , and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together . Instead , Anita and Me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable , as the English are almost an version of the Indian Untouchable caste , and this is underscored by a thinly - veiled series of attacks upon the film 's "" other "" community : the English.I felt Anita and Me is a hate - filled , grievance - based piece of work . On that basis , the BBC should not have funded its production ."	0
I like movies about UFOs , which is why I recently decided to rewatch EYES BEHIND THE STARS after seeing it when I was a kid back in the late 1970s . And now I 'm compelled to write a review about it because I 'm afraid I 'll start forgetting everything about it FAST . You see , even though EBTS ai n't bad , it 's VERY dull and nondescript . The story is sorta interesting but flat . The actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing . The FX are terribly amateurish but I can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling , which , unfortunately , this one ain't.Also , there 's very little violence and there 's no nudity whatsoever , which makes this 1970s Italian sci - fi opus a TRUE oddity , because if there 's one thing that distinguishes Italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade , it 's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them . Oddly enough , because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements , EBTS stands out from the rest of the pact . I do n't know if this can be seen as a compliment though . Personally , I can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but I think EBTS NEEDED more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry . And the special effects are n't that special.The story itself is actually interesting . It 's a combo of THE X - FILES and Antonioni 's BLOWUP : a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country . The aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model , subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth . The problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer 's apartment ( this taking place just before she 's to be abducted herself ) . The man takes some of the negatives and leaves , with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives . The whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives . The majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue , in the spy vs spy variety . The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war McGuffin . But as dull as EYES BEHIND THE STARS is , it does resemble THE X - FILES a LOT ! I wonder if Chris Carter saw this movie . Anyway , the best thing in EBTS are the POV shots , which are creepy and effective . But the rest is almost completely forgettable , including the goofy looking aliens.Even though I 've been mostly negative about this film , I sorta cherish it nonetheless . I still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when I saw it as a kid . And I own the video . The film could have been so much more if it had been done properly . Oh well ...	0
"The best way for me to describe Europa , which is high on the list of my favourite films , is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended : "" I did n't know films could be made like that "" . Entirely original in it 's visual style , it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be . It 's as far away from the "" master and coverage "" style of shooting as one can get ; perfectly integrating many layers of image , sound , effects , props , dialogue , voice over , performance , editing , lighting , etc ... all equal , none predominant . Despite Hollywood 's "" dialogue "" myopia , cinema is not about dialogue , nor is it about beautiful lighting , action or music . It works best when all the elements are on an equal footing , where ONLY the BLENDING of those elements , in the order or combination in which they are presented , will communicate the idea . Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element , and the film has no meaning . "" Europa "" is what cinema should strive to be ."	1
If you have any clue about Jane Austen´s production , you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels : marriage , marriage and marriage ! In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring , but I like Austen´s characters , because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma . The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow , she´s very good in her leading role . Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious .	1
"$ 25,000 Pyramid Clues : Deep Blue Sea . Tremors . Slither . Eight Legged Freaks.Pyramid Category : Movies that were funnier and more thrilling than Snakes on a Plane.Hell , with that definition I 'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of Ted and Elaine in Airplane ! as superior to Snakes in both laughs and thrills.The sad truth is that this is n't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies : Anaconda ! Besides the never to be seen again casting of JLo - Cube - O.Wilson - Stoltz - Wuhrer in the same flick , you had Jon Voight pulling off the all - time cinematic heist . His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a "" so - ludicrous - it's - fun "" movie.In the end , Snakes on a Plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible . Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year , all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop - sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater . I heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for "" According to Jim "" ."	0
"Revolt of the Zombies is BAD . There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie . It is dull , lifeless , poorly acted , and poorly scripted . I 've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste , well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride . The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes.The story : An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "" zombification "" . One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him . Once this happens , he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences . That 's it . That 's the whole story.For most of the movie , I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead . He looked so familiar . I had plenty of time to think this over . Nothing was happening in the movie . Just before the "" zombies revolted "" , it hit me . It was Dean Jagger . I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas . This is how I "" entertained "" myself throughout most of the movie.I'm just glad I did n't buy the DVD for this movie . King of the Zombies is on the other side and it 's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie . For what it 's worth , I 'll give it a 2/10 . ( I wo n't go to 1/10 because , believe it or not , I 've seen worse . )"	0
"I 'm writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and I am still reeling from the impact Wildside has had on me.It has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded . But it took it further and did n't stray from the realism of the streets , often portraying life events and characters down to a T.I am sorely missing this series , instead we have are given the stupid "" Underbelly "" which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of American - esquire garbage.Wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of Sydney and for that I am truly indebted to this wonderful series . The acting was A - grade and it 's a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity.I do n't want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history , thus I ask the ABC to release the complete series on DVD , not the first three . Give this series the ending it deserves ."	1
"A documentarist , like any filmmaker , must convey a compelling story . Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort , cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky 's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton . The footage is shot amateurishly and in video . Pascoe 's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen : "" 9 - 11 , "" "" Activism , "" "" Truth . ""Lame.Compare this with documentaries like "" The Corporation "" or "" The Fog of War "" which create a narrative drawing material from interviews , stock footage , and filmed footage . In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky 's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma , and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky 's recounting of his experience with National Public Radio . He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views , while NPR 's liberal dogma strait - jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages . Yet another media outlet to be skeptical of.This documentary is for Noam Chomsky completists only ."	0
"Can not believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west . Not to repeat other reviews here . The score is very good and moving . Literally it means "" Dawn please never comes "" - when it comes , the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever . After 24 years , Joel and Leslie still look great . I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many movies by Leslie including Better Tomorrow ."	1
"I could n't not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel ( trust me , double negatives are required here -- it 's that bad ) . This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter . The musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ( "" Thank You Very Much "" has a decent melody , but the lyrics are stupid beyond words ) . I would gladly bear the chains worn by Scrooge in the film 's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.The only entertaining part of this movie ( completely unintentional by the way ) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley . Dressed in a silly powder white costume , Guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost , or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie . Albert Finney , meanwhile , blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of Quasimodo / Scrooge . Finney 's Scrooge is so hideous a person , it 's impossible to believe his transformation.Steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs ."	0
An actor 's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it 's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display , and this film is no exception.But worse than that , even by 1982 standards this is so bad , it 's hysterically funny . Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget , most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff , wooden , and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater . Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog , and the dialog is truly bad , very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic . Scenes are contrived and choppy , and even though the characters go through a span of years , neither the children nor the adults age at all.I do believe it 's possible to make a Christian film that 's palatable to a large , secular audience , but too often the creators of such films are so focused on ' The Message ' or in this case , their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside . ( I 'm sure it 's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member . ) < br />Luckily , Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films . Careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one .	0
Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent . So is Uttara Baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles . Along with Kairee , its an example of Marathi cinema at its best . There are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in . These scenes probably emerge from the film - maker 's political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it . But apart from such minor quibbles , its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one I strongly recommend . Sumitra Bhave 's concern and humanism shines through .	1
"I 've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini - series , "" Planet Earth , "" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough . Nevertheless , whether it was screened down here in Australia or not , I never caught up with it , and when I happened upon the opportunity to see ' Earth ( 2007 ) '  a feature - length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen , I jumped at the chance . The theatre was basically empty ; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me , and it was as though I had , not only the big screen to myself , but , indeed , the entire planet Earth . For 90 minutes , I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness , amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film . Awesome in its scope , and yet painfully intimate at times , ' Earth ' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet , and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction.Though the film , directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield , obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness , it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda , and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether ; indeed , there is not a human in sight . Instead , we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world , to experience the resilience , and also the fragility , of life on Earth . I hear that the original mini - series , which ran for eleven episodes , delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems , but I think that , here , the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact : I ca n't remember the last time that I felt so inspired , and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time . By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals , anthropomorphising them to an extent , we are suddenly able to appreciate the "" human side "" of each species , and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy.'Earth ' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes , whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice , or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life - saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta . The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death , most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator - prey interactions . Though occasionally , perhaps to cater towards a younger audience , the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment , I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature , and the raw instinct that fuels these animals ' final , hopeless efforts at survival . There 's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt , both in the slow - motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey { the result of a single fateful misstep } , or the majestic mid - air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion . It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.Aside from these main stories , we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world , including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea , and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes . Of course , entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone , and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly . By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear , elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles , via some astonishing high - definition time - lapse photography , throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show , and only 90 minutes to show it . Consequently , ' Earth ' left me thirsting for more , and , fortunately , I now have approximately eleven hours more , as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box - set for "" Planet Earth . "" Uplifting and tear - jerking , awe - inspiring and heartrending , ' Earth ' is a truly magnificent documentary experience , and it might just be my favourite film of 2007 ."	1
OK . I admit . I 'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series . Star Trek ( Next Generation ) was my first space date , and since then I 've switched partners regularly . I 've seen'em all , it seems , and my favorites are « Lexx » , « Farscape » and the new « Battlestar Galactica » , in other words : the newest , state of the art space operas . But , I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones , the cheap ones , like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show « Blakes7 » . Here , the budgets are smaller than hobbits , the special effects seem to be made on a Commodore 64 , but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor , the acting dead serious and at times even high class?But why do they always speak English in the space future ? Because this is NOT the future , it 's fantasy for kids . Still , it can be irritating at times . Me , being a Norwegian , have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series , like science fiction , for Scandinavian viewers . I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened . But it did , actually , once , and even in my own homeland , Norway . I was two years old when the so called Fjernsynsteatret ( TV theater section ) of our national public service channel Nrk produced this three episode version of Blindpassasjer ( The Stowaway).When I first heard of it , I was not surprised of the fact that until this day , the show has only been screened once in Norway , making it impossible for me to actually see it . It went on Swedish , danish and Finnish television also , in it 's time , but that was a long time ago . There have been no video or DVD release of it , not a surprise either , and when it was screened on an art house cinema , this happened in Bergen , a city far far away from Oslo ( where I live ) . And then there 's another fact about « Blindpassasjer » that did n't surprise me , that it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing ( Bing&Bringsværd ) . This duo basically introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the seventies ; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose . In my opinion , Bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers , and has written several great and entertaining novels , masterpieces even , some of them hilarious , such as « Bazar » and « Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost » . No other than this guy , also an acclaimed dramatist , could construct the script of « Blindpassasjer».When I finally got to watch it , it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80 's , eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me . He was a nice bloke . So I sat down and watched it , with Swedish subtitles , bad sound and some scrapes and errors ; but the thing came through and I was surprised that I eventually came to love it.The exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in Blakes7 , and the credit goes to Caprino studios ( who made the famous Flåklypa Grand Prix ) , and the interior of the Marco Polo ( the space ship ) works better than I 'd expected . The acting is typically theatrical , but it works better than when they play Ibsen , to put it mildly , and Bjørn Floberg carries his role solidly , as does Trini Lund . The legendary actress Henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre , but this is an ensemble play , and I 'm happy to say that Ola B. Johannesen carries his mustache with nobility , and Marit Østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.But is it really that good ? Well , one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending , the pretentious criticism of « modern society » , but yes , it 's , well , not really really really fantastic , but charming , cool , nostalgic and pleasant . One and a half hour of classic Norwegian SciFi .	1
"I would have liked to write about the story , but there was n't any . I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but "" hinglish "" is only funny for like 5 minutes , after that its overkill . I would have liked to swoon over the ' keep - u - guessing suspense ' but it was as predictable as ... um mm , a Yash raj movie ( ? ) . I would have liked to talk of the edge - of - the - seat action , but I do n't like cartoons much . < br />*sigh*All in all , this movie is perfect for : 1 . people attempting suicide - I promise it 'll push you over the edge 2 . Sado - masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da - Vinci code wore . 3 . People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 . Movie Piraters : More power to them . If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it . 5.Barnacles , most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers . Afterthought : The director of the movie , obviously , is a species of his own . ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .. one is enough)Things that could have made this a better movie : 1 . A story 2 . A choreographer 3 . A Screenplay writer 4 . A stunt coordinator 5 . A story ( Did I already say that ? ) 6 . A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job ) 7 . Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8 . A statutory warning - "" Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health "" ? < br />Things I liked about the movie : 1 . Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 . The English sub - titles - "" Mera Dil Kho Gaya "" becomes - "" My heart is in a void "" , "" Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "" turns into "" I m a flirt , I m a lover , I m a vagabond "" .. priceless.In short , Tashan to me , is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player , Tashan promises to lower your IQ , and that .. in a mere 2.5 hours ! Woot!*sigh* .. But that s just me . I could be wrong You 've been warned anyways ."	0
That Certain Thing is the story of a gold digger ( Viola Dana ) from a tenement house . Her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers , but they are a loving family . Although Dana 's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor , she refuses and holds out for a millionaire . Everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy , but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire , son of the owner of the popular ABC restaurant chain . The two marry hastily , but the girl 's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger . However , she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.A rare glimpse of movie star Viola Dana , this film is a lot of fun . Dana 's role is accessible , natural , and entertaining . She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too . The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility . The title cards are also incredibly clever.If you like films like My Best Girl , It , or The Patsy , you will enjoy this film .	1
"This an free adaptation of the novels of Clarence Mulford ; fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here ( and the reviews here so far reflect that ) . But I knew of Hopalong from the novels first , and never cared much for the Boyd films once I got around to them.Christopher Coppola has made a wise choice - he has not made a nostalgic "" Western "" ; instead , he has approached the Cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call ' Americana ' ; or what older critics once called ' homespun ' . As the film unraveled , I found myself more and more reminded of the great "" Hallmark Theater "" version of Mark Twain 's "" Roughing It "" , with James Garner narrating.Both these films remind us that , although films about the ' old west ' are probably always to be mythic for Americans , they need not be ' westerns ' ; they can very well be just films about what it meant to be American in that time , in that place.I never feel pandered to , watching this film ; there 's no effort to shove the Boyd - Cassidy legacy down our throats , no irony , no camp . Consequently , I get a sense of these characters as having walked - or ridden horseback - across some real western America I too could have walked a hundred years ago.Given that , the plainness of the film - it positively avoids anything we have come to call "" style "" - is all to its favor ; and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this ; gosh , it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing , just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn . I was very pleasantly surprised by this film , and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations , he or she will find considerable pleasure in it.I would have given this film 9-stars , but I 'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely ; and I urge them to set their memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance.Note 1 : A reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people dead in this film , rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ( ala Boyd 's Cassidy ) ; first , Cassidy DOES shoot people dead in the novels ; second , if Cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead - the problem with shooting guns out of people 's hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film.Note 2 : I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family , that they have the Director of "" The Godfather "" among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that I ca n't ; but a good movie is a good movie ; and this is a good movie . If it 's by somebody by the name "" Coppola "" , well , that 's just is as it is . America is the land of opportunity ( or was , until Bush got into office ) - that 's what the great American novels are all about ."	1
"Wow . Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately , but this one especially is begging for a beatdown . Let 's start at the beginning . First , writer - director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role , complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence . Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite . Montford 's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night , Della is furious that somebody double - parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year . She decides to do something about it , so she leaves a nasty note on the car 's windshield . The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall . When she finally gets to her car , the thugs confront her about the note , a cop is killed , and she runs , and they catch up to her , and she gets away , and they chase her some more , and on and on . Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving . The thugs are not scary or menacing at all , and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways.This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine . Why the bad guys do n't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me . And once , just once , in a film like this , does the leader of the pack have to die last ? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming "" Della ! ! ! "" And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della , exhausted and hurt , cries out to the heavens , "" Where are you , God ? "" Where , indeed , was god when this movie was being made ? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting , and it 's not as bad as ' BTK Killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film . Cheers !"	0
An older man touches a flower in his wife 's greenhouse that seems to be wilting . He gets pricked by it , or bitten by something on it . He quickly becomes ill , and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind . A later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.A cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot - out . Somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors , as well as an entomologist who is brought in . There are several young kids wandering around the hospital , who I suppose we 're supposed to find adorable , but who are extremely annoying little brats . They happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept , and happen to dump a growth hormone on it . Horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this , but they 're never even in any danger.The critter grows and starts breeding . People run away from it , and sometimes towards it for some reason . The hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.There are no really compelling characters in the movie , and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster . It was fairly boring . Clearly it owes something to the Alien movies , with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth . There 's also a character named Bishop , and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver 's hair .	0
In his directorial debut , Denzel Washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington 's acting efforts , but now we see this touch as a director.Recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection . This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end.We can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be understated.If the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty . This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does n't transcend from a novel to the screen . This , of course , is a tribute to the Director.This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too !	1
Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature , particularly the nature of addiction , which still resonate strongly today.As for the movie ... eh . Nothing special . The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything , making the viewer quite nauseous . Why the director did n't put a stop to this is beyond me -- but maybe he was too busy trying , and somehow failing , to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately - cast actors . All in all , a weak adaptation . Your three hours would be better spent reading ( or re - reading ) the book .	0
This is yet another tell - it - as - it - is Madhur Bhandarkar film . I am not sure why he has this obsession to show Child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the Indian filmy audience , but I find some of those scenes really disgusting ! What 's new ? It is a nice piece put together by Bhandarkar , where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film , Mr & Mrs Iyer . What makes this movie different is , that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with , such as her roomies , her colleagues , film stars , models , rich people and others featured in the Entertainment Page#3 in her newspaper.Noticeable : It is another good performance from Mrs Iyer . She is likely to be noticed for this role . She does selective roles but shines in them . She is noticeably de - glamorized and less beautiful in this film . But then , entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover , right ? Verdict : Madhur has come up with another good movie , that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely . However , this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey.Is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people ? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the REAL crime reporter ? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press ? or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g*y folk . The other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co - stars , if they wish to enter Bollywood.In addition , he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people , etc . He also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families.This was all okay for me .. but might be too complex for an average movie - goer , who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work	1
I recently watched Belle Epoque , thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film . I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film . Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now , the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times . Aside from predictability of the plot , some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ( ex . a certain event at the wedding ) . At times the film was a bit preachy in it 's ideas and in relation to the Franco era the film was set in and the Church . The only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments , the scenery , and the character of Violeta being a strong , independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics .	0
I love this movie and never get tired of watching . The music in it is great . Any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack . With rockers like Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne you ca n't go wrong .	1
Return To The 3th Chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin , in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te , a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter . In this sequel Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten . He imitates the original Shan Te , tries all manner of tricks to get into Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses . Its a classic light hearted martial arts tale , with the ace production values of the Shaw Brothers and the sure footed direction of Lui Chia Liang . The choreography is fantastic throughout , whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu 's performance , as are the others , particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . The film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander , more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers films . But few have such a magical blend of slapstick , unique training and fighting , with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good . Full of light hearted joy , its impossible not to give this the highest score .	1
With this cast and budget you will expect more.John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange , yet still work . Neither he , his sister , nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage.The movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that . The plot goes nowhere , the writing is contrived , senseless and the characters paper thin . If you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery , this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey.Dan Akroyd 's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie , 1991 's Nothing but Trouble . Frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired .	0
"Remember the good ol' animated batman show from the 90 's ? The one that people praised ? The one that people of all ages could all appreciate ? The one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit ? The one that had villains you could relate to ? The one that had villains with real motives?Well clearly , Warner Bros. does n't . Hence this dreck.Honestly , do these people know anything about batman ? Have they even looked at a batman comic before ? Do they know Batman 's meant to be a ' detective ' ? Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective ! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey!This is the basic layout for an episode:Penguin steals something . ' Opening credits ' . Batman finds dead giveaway of where he is . Batman goes there and get 's into trouble . Commercial . Batman finds obvious/ stupid way out of it . Penguin escapes . Penguin does something obvious again . Batman follows . They do kung - fu ( by the way everyone , and i mean EVERYONE know 's kung - fu for some reason ) . Batman punch 's penguin . he get 's knocked out . goes to arkham . ( Note : it 's usually a different villain every episode)Well as you may have noticed from that , Batman 's not a great detective . "" Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground , maybe he 's at the old amusement park "" ! Yeah maybe , he was there the last 6 times.And I 've already mentioned this but , EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG - FU ! EVEN PENGUIN ! what where they thinking ? ( probably because it 's from the people who made that Jackie Chan animated series)What 's really upsetting is that the show is just action . No smarts . None . If batman needs think , he 'll use technology , then do some kung - fu.But hey , let 's not forget the villains . Afterall , what would batman be without his rogues gallery?Well first off , I got ta say , kudos for originality . I do n't think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread - locked monkey man , riddler like an emo , and poison ivy as a minor ( which is kind of confusing when you think about , is n't her sexuality meant to be her main strength?)What 's even more crap however is that , every character is now a 2-Dimensional , stereotypical crook.E.G.Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason.Man - Bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason.Penguin just wants to steal everything . For no reason.noticing a pattern here?But the most insulting has got to be Mr Freeze.Do you remember the Emmy award winning ' Heart of Ice ' episode from Batman : The Animated Series ? The one that gave Mr Freeze motives for his crimes ? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story ( mad scientist ) ? The one that made him a victim , with a goal ? Hell , even Batman & Robin acknowledged that , using that as Mr Freezes origin in that P.O.S. movie.Well this series says "" F#ck that "" and makes Mr Freeze a jewelry robber before his accident , with only wealth in his mind , then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold . He then continues to steal jewels for no reason , while saying sh!t lines like "" Have an ice day"".Maybe they did watch Batman & Robin after all.But hey , look on the bright side . This series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that you 're a good person . Good for you ."	0
"On second viewing of this movie , I like it even more than the first time . It is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans . Here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences , the meeting of a tow truck driver and client , the jogger hearing a baby 's cry from the bushes . The dialogue , acting , casting and direction are superb . No two by fours , no grand revelations . What I did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated . Kudos to all involved in this , we need more "" Grand Canyons "" in our lives . 9 out of 10 ."	1
Really an amazing pile of pap ! < br />A predictable , slow moving , soul destroying , mind numbing movie to which , slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well , almost necessary.The acting is over done for the thin dialogue , every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be , the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words . The music would be good if you did n't have to sit through the movie , but really , three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie.Watching this film I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me.Never , ever , ever again .	0
This movie is one of those I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that I 'll never get back in . The premise is really interesting - essentially it 's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead ( let 's not split hairs as to whether they 're actually dead or not } . Unfortunately , they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework . The nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film , but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it . If they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged , it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary .	0
Well , when before I saw this film I really was n't sure whether it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was ! I thought that this was one of the best films I 've watched for a very long time , a real family classic . The story of a young evacuee and his new ' foster ' dad , this film ticks all the boxes . I 've not read the book ( maybe that 's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more ) but with regards to the story , I really ca n't think of any bad points , hence scoring it 10 out of 10 ( and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks ! ) . By the time William proclaimed ' I CAN RIDE MY BIKE , DAD ! ' I was sobbing my heart out ( anyone who 's seen it will understand , I 'm sure ) . Really heartwarming , and definitely recommended .	1
"Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable , particularly from "" Down Argentine Way "" , but by the time she got around to this disaster , she had also got "" round "" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment . Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr ( who must have been fairly desperate ) the story was bad , the colours good , and the film far too long . It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success . The music score was woeful , and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way .... as I was such a fan of Miss Grable , I always wish I had never seen this one !"	0
Karen goes into a Japanese house as a substitute nurse to Emma , a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night . Karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost . She will learn the house 's secrets.It is very scary ! The scenes are shocking and frightening ! The characters are good . The settings are creepy . I love the whole plot ! The ending was shocking ! I paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and I was shocked . This is the scariest movie I have watched . I did not see the Japanese version . I recommend this to horror fans . 10/10 and 5 stars !	1
This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 . It looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier , and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture . I weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this .	0
"George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch . But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey , where myth becomes reality and a flesh - eating spirit , half animal and half man Wendigo , haunts a small town ... ""Wendigo "" by Larry Fessenden is a thought - provoking horror film that often tenderfoot 's into a somber family drama . The acting is great , the characters are well - developed and there are some bone - chilling moments . The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it 's never clear what is real and what is imagined , or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles ' head . Overall,""Wendigo "" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden 's work and surely wo n't be the last . Give this film a chance , if you do n't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10 ."	1
"Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves . This Fantasy is modeled after the "" Walking with Dinosuars "" series . Even though this is 100 % fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way . Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T - rexs and the extinction of the dinos . Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci - Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes . But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10 . Do n't get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong . I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.I also think this weakens the great "" Walking with Dinosuars "" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini - series ."	0
"The first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is "" beauty "" . Beauty is all around , in actors ' play ( Andie is superb as always ) , in well designed shots , and in authors ' red line idea - the Love.I think the Kenny 's character is the only white spot in these three womens ' otherwise boring and predictable life . His interaction makes Andie 's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be . When he 's gone , it became obvious that we can not really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires.The fact that Andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad , instead it shows that life prevails in any forms , even in this small British village , which is shown perfectly.Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in all ways - all that houses and "" fags "" and accents :))) . And Andie again is doing superb job ! It is a shame that this movie got such low marks . 10 out of ten !"	1
Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again , this time it involves mobile phones . Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed , so essentially if you 've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera . So far I 've been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls , however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo - Cronenberg style of Audition . Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty , at least they do have merits such as these , or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp . There 's none of that in One Missed Call ; there 's just very little of credit : the acting is bland and average , there is very little ( nothing , in all honesty ) in the way of scares or suspense , and in places it 's just downright boring.However , there are moments where Miike 's glacier - like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism ; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects , and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls ' life . But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera ; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace ( and that includes his famous gore ) , although it 's more likely he just did n't have any enthusiasm for the project , and I can understand why . One Missed Call is n't offensively bad . It 's just frustratingly average.Miike obviously loves directing . With his huge yearly output it 's obvious he is n't going to be 100 % concerned about all his projects . But even with this in mind , One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills .	0
The storyline is absurd and lame , also sucking are performances and the dialogue , is hard to keep your Eyes open . I advise you to have a caffeine - propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore - effects . Why they bring Alcatraz in?In this case , becomes increasingly difficult to swallow . All the while , i wondered who this film aimed for?Chock full of lame subplots ( such as the Cannibalism US Army - captain)This is low - grade in every aspect . BTW this Movie is banned in Germany ! !	0
The Legend of Zu , as I saw it , was a very interesting story . I think many of the people who did n't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film . They were expecting something akin to Star Wars , and it was not that . Joseph Campbell , I believe , would have liked this film . There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked . We all have a mountain of swords within us . We all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives . We all have to face our own insomnia someday . Granted some of the narration was a bit confusing , and some of the action got a little hokey at times , but I think other points of the film easily made up for it . I 'd watch it again . < br />I do n't know if there 's a difference between The Legend of Zu ( which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles ) and Zu Warriors ( The dubbed USA version . ) It might have been dumbed down for American audiences , which really would have detracted from this film .	1
How can you resist watching a film with some swing ? It 's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line . Too bad they do n't tour out here ... I'd go see them . See it if for no other reason than to hear some good music .	1
Henry Hathaway was daring , as well as enthusiastic , for his love of the people of the early days in US history . However , to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film . In my opinion , Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release . In often subtle filming and dialog delivery , he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950 's . That was just over 10 years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed , which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were . I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film.1 . Love for all people , regardless of their personal beliefs , 2 . Charity to those in need or not , 3 . Family is high in importance , 4 . Listen respectfully and carefully , because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt , 5 . Work hard , both individually and in community , 6 . Prepare and store for future days of need , 7 . Hope is a binding link to a higher being , and for our daily lives , 8 . And , that there is a unique quality to any group , and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial .	1
Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian . This movie is totally about people living in poverty . You will see nothing but angry in this movie . It makes you feel bad but still worth . All those who 's too comfortable with materialization should spend 2.5 hours with this movie .	1
"Noni Hazlehurst , Colin Friels , Alice Garner , Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton- what more could you ask for ? Monkey Grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores Nora ( Hazlehurst , a single mother falling for a heroin addict Jobe ( Friels ) . A simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting ( in particular Noni Hazlehurst ) and nice use of the small budget . The only flaw is ( if you can pick it up ) is that the story is set in Melbourne , although for budget reasons , the film was mainly shot in Sydney , so as a result , in a few scenes you see trams ( Melbourne scenes ) and then a Carlton post office ( Sydney scenes ) . Other than that , "" Monkey Grip "" is a must see ( excuse the clique , but it is ) at least for an award winning performance from former "" Play School "" and "" Better Homes & Gardens "" presenter Noni Hazlehurst.10/10"	1
The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what Greene wrote ; for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre , or the murdered - child obsession that takes over some of the plot . Where the film deviates from the novel , it tends to the ludicrous.However I do n't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way . It always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good ' un . Some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to anything.It 's a dreadful shame that the film 's not available on DVD .	1
I do n't know how anyone could hate this movie . It is so funny . It took a unique mind to come up with this storyline . It 's not your typical alien movie . These aliens are so stupid and confused . You need to rent it at least once .	1
"It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe ever met and spoke with Albert Einstein ( and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death , we may never know ) , but in their lifetime the opportunity was there.Scripted by Terry Johnson from his own play , Nicolas Roeg 's Insignificance imagines an encounter in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio ( Busey ) , and Senator Joseph McCarthy ( Curtis ) - but only on one level . On another level , it elevates - or reduces - these ' personalities ' ( and what a lousy phrase that is ) to mere avatars ( the characters are deliberately unnamed ) , at once greater and lesser in status.The title Insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic ; here , DiMaggio 's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card . Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress , hair , lipstick , wiggle and voice . By uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles , the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity , exploding the cult of personality.Furthering the theme , there will be another explosion at the film 's climax : Hiroshima in a hotel suite , in which ' The Actress ' is burned to a cinder in seconds ; a literal deconstruction of fame . Goodbye , Norma Jean . History informs the script , which in turn , shakes history upside down . As Roeg mused after watching Johnson 's play for the first time , "" These characters were mythic , not invented by any single person , not the public or the press , probably not even by the characters themselves . "" As played by Theresa Russell , Marilyn ( a closet intellectual in real life ) , lectures a childlike Einstein ( ' The Professor ' , played by Emil ) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight , while getting The Professor to show off his legs , in conscious parody of her own role in The Seven - Year Itch , the movie The Actress is seen to be working on in the film 's opening.History records that Monroe 's then - husband , fading baseball star DiMaggio ( played by Busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton ) , was unhappy about her iconic dress - splaying scene in the film , precipitating their break - up . Right on cue , we discover the jealous ' Ballplayer ' in a bar , bemoaning the fact that if , "" I want to see her underwear , I just walk down to the corner like all the other guys"".In contrast to The Professor , The Ballplayer believes the universe is round - a contention shared by Native Americans . But the Big Chief ( Sampson , of One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest fame ) who operates the Roosevelt Hotel 's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture : "" I no longer Cherokee - I watch TV . "" Meanwhile , ' The Senator ' is investigating The Professor , who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the United Nations , but whom The Senator suspects is a Red . In fact , as he divulges to Monroe , Einstein is wracked with guilt over Hiroshima , and what the white heat future holds . Yet in a seemingly godless universe , all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher ( atomic ) power.Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson 's stage play to the screen . Throughout , tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash - forwards ( ka - boom ! ) draw unexpected connections between time , place and circumstance , with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time 's passing - but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time ; each moment co - existing . As evinced by his back catalogue , it 's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity - see Do n't Look Now in particular . Here , 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip - feeds into the 1980s , a period in which another ' Actor ' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States.If all this sounds rather heavy going ( quantum physics is surely involved ) , the execution is anything but , owing to Johnson 's witty , zippy screenplay , Roeg 's playful direction , opening out an essentially stagey set - up - and the cast themselves , who are on stellar form . Tony Curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid , impotent Senator , who is seen attempting congress with a Monroe impersonator ( a real one , as opposed to Russell 's ) , before being let down by his dwindling member.Of course , Curtis once co - starred with the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot , and whose embrace he memorably described as like "" kissing Hitler "" . As Roeg commented , "" Everything suddenly seemed connected ... when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking . "" It all goes into the pot , to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways ."	1
This must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely African - American cast . Every derogatory , disparaging stereotype of the black American community is featured prominently . I wo n't reinforce the insults by listing them here , except to mention chickens , watermelons , and dice.One good song by Ethel Waters ( and a couple of bad ones ) , and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year - old Sammy Davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the IMDb scale .	0
I saw that movie few days ago . This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can have it . This shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness , hopeless and failure . But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy .	1
Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations . Angela Lansbury , ( Eglantine Price ) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off . Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world . However , Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch . Mr. Emerlius Browne , ( David Tomlinson ) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution . Eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the Nazi 's from evading England . Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today .	1
Prior to this film , I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi : the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore ( 1981 ) , famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man - child Peter Bark , and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer . Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema , but both were entertaining in their own special way ( and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity did n't hurt ) . Massacre , however , is dull , dull , dull , despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.The story , about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot , is confusing and oh - so boring : when the blood is n't flowing and the skin is n't on show , the film is a real struggle to sit through ( it took me four attempts to finish ) , with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.The only point of interest about the film is that its producer , Lucio Fulci , used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega - gory movie Cat In The Brain ( AKA Nightmare Concert ) . And if you 've already seen that film , then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre .	0
"As a long - time fan of Superman from the comics , through the 1950s series , the first two of the Chris Reeves films and Lois & Clark , and finally Smallville , I was * really * hoping for something clever with "" Superman Returns"".Instead we got Lex Luthor making * another * attempt at real - estate conversion , another Superman - beaten - up - while - wearing - kryptonite sequence , and internal inconsistencies : he could n't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 "" of kryptonite , but when Lois breaks off 3 "" of it , * leaving the rest embedded in him * , he can lift * a continent * into space ? ?

As a Westerner watching another culture 's view and tradition of marriag , I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful . The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult , especially in this modern age . Yet this is the case in this Hindi film . Told with humor , and fresh perspective , we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon . As said , it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place . We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night , and how they try to forge a bond , even though they do not know one another . We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday , from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment . There 's song , witty dialog , poignant moments , blending and comparison of new ways and tradition . Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story , yet it is still a delight to watch . Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived ; however the overall movie was worth watching .	1
This is a horrible movie . All three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad . The first is about wild wolves and some lady , there are some things that do n't make sense , but the hypnotism thing makes up for that . The second one , with bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone . The last one , sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which I guess makes it better than the other garbage .	0
"Once again I have seen a movie made by people that know nothing . I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson . Now I 've seen Dillinger and I 've had it.This movie is garbage . I do n't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like Bonnie and Clyde . This movie is far from a classic . Someone called it brilliant . That 's an insane thing to say . This movie ca n't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting I 've ever seen . I do n't know whose dumb idea it was to cast Warren Oates as John Dillinger . First of all he looks nothing like him . Second of all , by the time John Dillinger was killed he was 31 . When Oates made this he was 45 ! You could even tell that he 's older than the real Dillinger just by looking at him . Not only was he too old , but so was Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis.They show Baby Face Nelson die , then Homer Van Meter , and finally John Dillinger . John Dillinger was killed before both of them . The last one to die out of the three was Baby Face Nelson . Not only do the writers not know when they died , but they also do n't know how they died . Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe . Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns . Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St. Paul and gunned down with machine guns . Another member of Dillinger 's gang , Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie . Pierpont was n't shot . Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair . I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I 'm not going to go into it again here . Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss ' portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic . There 's a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating . While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming , "" Leave me alone ! "" Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought . Maybe Dillinger did n't agree with Nelson 's bank robbing methods , but they never fought . Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten . They keep calling him Lester "" Baby Face "" Nelson . He was never in his life known by that name . Nelson 's real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson . The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood , but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood . John Milius does n't know anything . Where the hell did John Milius get his information ? I could probably make a better movie than him.Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable . The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette . By the way , Billie Frechette was n't even there that night . But a girl named Polly Hamilton was . Melvin Purvis yells , ' Johnny ! ' Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell . It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night . The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away . They did n't even have to shoot him . They were so close that powder burns were found on his face . It was murder . They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger . After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man ? The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillinger 's death . I could go on and on how the man they killed was n't John Dillinger , but I 'll stop here . If you would like to know more check it out here < br />See the Dillinger version with Lawrence Tierney if you want , but do n't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie ."	0
"Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert . She gives her all every time she is on stage . Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads , Bette Midler moves her audience . If you ca n't see it live ( which is the best way to see Bette ) then this is the next best thing . An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power . Her more "" vocally correct "" version of "" Stay With Me "" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS , Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever . I will treasure this concert for a very long time ."	1
"This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different . It plays right into the "" Multiple Universe "" theory.The only thing that does n't ring true is how Larry Burrows ( James Belushi)has such a hard time understanding what is going on , that everything has changed.<br / >"	1

"Todd Rohal is a mad genius . "" Knuckleface Jones "" , his third , and most fully realized , short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads . What the film is about at heart , and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this , is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration . Or not . You just have to see for yourself . The short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit , so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you 'll be glad you did . It is hilarious . And check out Todd 's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time : "" Single Spaced "" and "" Slug 660 "" ."	1
"... This would be the worst film i 'd ever seen . Hmmm , OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then . Awful , truly awful.I had low expectations and it failed to meet them ! I honestly ca nt think of one good thing . so here are the worst points ... 1 . THE ACTING 2 . THE PLOT 3 . THE CGI ( Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously ) 4 . THE PLOT 5 . THE DIALOGUE and finally .... 6 . THE PLOT < br />There are so many unanswered questions , Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they had n't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no - one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman 's son and the henchman he kills?!!Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?When Superman goes to hospital , why do n't the doctors ask "" What the F * * * do you want us to do ? ! He 's a F***ing alien ! We do n't know jack about his anatomy ! "" ? < br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years ? < br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?and finally , Why ? Just , Why ? < br />BTW , for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite , i think i 've figured it out ...  ... since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks , it is clearly all in his head . therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock .... either that or the writers are slack - jawed half - wits who did n't think that was a fairly obvious mistake ."	0
"Before writing this review , I went back and reread the reviews of others . This movie was a particular disappointment to me , since it features two of my favorite dancers , Gene Kelly and George Chakiris , boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand ( "" Wuthering Heights , "" "" Ice Station Zebra , "" "" The Thomas Crowne Affair "" ) . The dancing was stilted , unmotivated and unoriginal , the songs forgettable , the story a joke . Even the costuming was not particularly flattering . Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit . I 'm glad other people enjoyed "" The Young Girls of Rochefort , "" though I most certainly did not ."	0
"Remember H.G. Wells ' "" The Invisible Man "" ? Well here 's another movie like it , only more extreme . "" Hollow Man "" is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes . At first making the serum was the easy part , making the person come back was not . Most of the first tries ended up unstable . Until one night , when he perfected the formula . And who else , but Caine would be the lab rat . The gorilla was the first and almost died , so when he came to , it was a close one . So when the did Caine , he decided to use it for fun . Then when he got tired of being not seen , the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh . However , the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should , and Caine would delve into madness . So he ends up being one mad invisible killer . It would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you . I would care less about the ones who did you wrong . Great movie , plenty of fun . 3 out of 5 stars !"	1
The story is about Ankush ( Abhay Deol ) - who is professional marriage witness , in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office - and Megha ( Soha Ali Khan ) who ran away from her home at Nainital to get married to her love interest Dhiraj ( Shayan Munshi ) . The story starts with Megha waiting at the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up . So Ankush comes in the picture here , who had approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs . 200 for his Witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her . Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an Agent&#8230 ; Ankush falls in love with Megha and she too falls in love with him ( or kind of love ) , both agree for the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture . Unexpected circumstances happen , actually I should say , expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then&#8230;.Actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and I do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different , then you will definitely like the movie . The movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan . The characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door . The background music of the film also plays a very good role , it is just too good . The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.so let 's cut it out and sum it up.Story : A very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience.Music : Well , as it was Himesh Reshammiya creation , so I did not expect much but still I liked couple of songs of the movie including the Qawwali.Acting : Abhay Deol was the most impressive , very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs . Soha Ali Khan , she is a doll , a very cute doll I must say . Again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters . Apart from these two , Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones . Other actors did their job well.Stars : I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5 . You will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre , I would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories . Otherwise wait for the DVD to arrive . The movie will definitely wo n't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity .	1
Ya I rented it , so shoot me!A decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff , but at least it 's shot well . Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside . In most cases this should be a slam dunk , but this little stinker derails quite quickly . The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best , but the story and writing is just plain awful . Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film . An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it 's luster before any type of horror transpires , and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it 's worth a rental if you 're looking for mindless low budget dreck , but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending , reach for something else .	0
""" Freddy 's Dead "" did the smartest thing it could 've done after the disappointment of the fifth film . It started from scratch . Sure , this "" final "" film in the saga is silly but at least it 's original . Some of the visuals are even a bit breath - taking . And the story of Freddy 's kid ( Lisa Zane ) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.Overall , the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater . It has a bunch of good actors ( Zane , Yaphet Kotto , and Lezlie Deane ) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter . It 's one - sided , it 's a magic - trick , and , in the end , it 's nothing but goofy , childish entertainment.<br / >"	0
"I teach Japanese for an online high school and I include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language . And watching "" Gung Ho "" is one of the requirements . The students can either buy or rent the movie . Stereotypes or not , this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do . Many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much , they are going to get a copy for themselves . It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture . I just wish I could get a cleaned - up TV version .

Phantom Lady ( 1944 ) Dir : Robert Siodmak < br />Production : Universal Pictures < br />Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) , following a nasty fight and split with his wife , looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole . There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and , looking for some companionship , asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems . She agrees , but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves . Sure enough , when Scott gets home he finds the police there , waiting to question him . His wife 's been murdered . Where were you at 8 o'clock this evening , asks Inspector Burgess ( Thomas Gomez ) ? But Scott has an alibi , right ? Only he does n't know the woman 's name . And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman . Neither does the cab driver . Nor the drummer ( Elisha Cook Jr. ) at the club . Even the dancer at the club , who Scott clearly caught looking at the woman ( they were both wearing the same hat ) , wo n't acknowledge there was someone with him . Something is going on , but whatever it is Scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife 's murder ( on the flimsiest ' evidence ' in Hollywood judicial history ) . It 's left to his loyal secretary , ' Kansas ' ( Ella Raines ) , who 's later joined by a sympathetic Inspector Burgess , to find out the real killer before Scott is executed.Phantom Lady is built on themes that recur , almost compulsively , in Woolrich 's work . For example , the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man . Additionally , there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black . It can leave a viewer feeling like he 's treading on well worn ground . But in the right hands , the feverish plots , sorry dialogue , the narrative inconsistencies , all are beside the point . Fortunately , Phantom Lady was being guided by sound hands.This is Siodmak 's first noir . He would go on to distinguish himself as one of the , if not the , preeminent practitioners of the style ( The Killers , Criss Cross ) . Here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell ( they would be reunited on Christmas Holiday and The Killers ) . There is some great storytelling done in the camera . In one shot , the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror , suggesting multiple personalities . The same character , who is an artist , has Van Gogh 's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment . But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look for noir . Released very early in 1944 , it 's all here ; the wet pavement , the bags of atmosphere and dread , the sharply contrasting b&w , the wildly expressionistic versions of reality ( when Kansas visits Scott in prison ) , the discordant shafts of light , etc . It is a terrific picture to look at.Franchot Tone aside , the cast , as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director ( and presumably , the budget ) , suggests ' B ' movie ambitions . I thought Tone was a little hammy . Alan Curtis ( High Sierra ) is not up to much , and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes . Ella Raines is mostly good ( and quite beautiful ) . Her ' sex scene ' with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed . Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him . It amounts to a chase scene , as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets , with a stop at a subway station . Some real good tension in there.<br / > * * * out of 4	1
In September 2003 36-year - old Jonny Kennedy died . He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( EB ) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch , leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer . In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death , and the result was a film , first broadcast in March , that was an uplifting , confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man . Not shying away from the grim reality of EB , the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full . Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary of that year . It attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny 's charity , DEBRA . A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left a one million pound legacy .	1

"There are many different versions of this one floating around , so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies , otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing . Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there . The cut I saw has the on - screen title WITCHCRAFT : EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show , who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release . It 's a nice - looking print and seems to have all of the footage , but has some cropping / aspect ratio issues . In Italy , it was released as LA CASA 4 ( WITCHCRAFT ) . The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films ( retitled ) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company ( Filmirage ) , which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE . To make matters even more confusing , WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 . Except in Germany , where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE : DEMONS 3 . OK , I better just shut up now . I 'm starting to confuse myself!Regardless of the title , this is a very hit - or - miss horror effort . Some of it is good , some of it is n't . I actually was into this film for the first half or so , but toward the end it became a senseless mess . A large , vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting , as various people get picked off one - by - one by a German- speaking witch ( Hildegard Knef ) . Photographer Gary ( David Hasselhoff ) , who wants to capture "" Witch Light , "" and his virginal writer girlfriend ( Leslie Cumming ) , who is studying witchcraft , are shacking up at the hotel without permission . Along comes real estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who 's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose ( Annie Ross ) and Freddie ( Robert Champagne ) Brooks . Also tagging along are their children ; pregnant grown daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and very young son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff 's wife at the time ) . Once everyone is inside , their boat driver is killed ( hung ) and the boat disappears , so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the "" Lady in Black . ""So what can you expect to find here ? Plenty of unpleasantries ! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow - roasted by the rest of the cast . There 's also a crucifixion , witches eating a dead baby , a swordfish through the head , someone set on fire , a possession , a Sesame Street tape recorder , the virgin getting raped by some demon , a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff . From a technical standpoint , it 's a nice - looking film with pretty good cinematography , a decent score and good gore effects . The hotel / island setting is also pretty nice . Blair ( particularly at the end ) and Ross both seem like they 're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch . Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days , he 's not bad in his role , either.On the down side , despite all the gore , the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour . The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing , too . When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed , the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy . And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber . And while most of the cast is at least decent , a few of the performances ( particularly the "" actress "" who plays Hasselhoff 's girlfriend and the kid ) are so bad they 're constantly distracting ."	0
"I know I should like this film , and I do for the most part , but as other 's have mentioned , it is a bit long in the tooth . I to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying . It 's a wonder they did n't start panting and howling at the moons as well . I also have to say that overall , the movie leaves me cold . It 's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film . On the plus side the effects are great ( besides the cartoon monster ) , as are the effects , props , costumes and of course Robbie . If the robot was not in this film , I do n't think it would have been as popular as it was / is . The second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "" Krell . "" As many times as I 've seen this movie , the Krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were . Based on what was being produced at that time , besides "" This Island Earth , "" Forbidden Planet is miles above the average Sci - Fi movies of the time . Being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment . Certainly a classic in its own right , flaws and all , and deservedly so ."	1
"I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's / early 70 's whenever it reared it 's head like a reindeer with rabies every November - December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show . It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T ( oops - can I SAY "" Christmas "" ? ) , perhaps the greatest , most iconic Christmas - season film of all time . But that 's another review.At the time , I marveled that the on - screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost "" pink and white "" , so much had the color of the sprocket - torn prints changed color.The film is kinda creepy ! I thought so then -- and still do , actually . I was highly entertained then , as I still am ! It 's amusing in a "" retarted - elf "" sort of way . By the way , the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater , circa 1969 - 74.If you are expecting maybe "" the lost RANKIN - BASS Christmas special - forget it ! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas -- read on ... By nature , the dubbing on these foreign films ( the original version here was in Spanish)always makes them seem "" surreal "" . This adds to the films inherent oddness . It is also pretty scary in that a "" mishevious demon "" ( as described in the original US trailer ) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids "" evil "" . One particularly nightmarish scene has a young "" latch - key "" boy wishing he had parents for Christmas - suddenly the "" port - a - family "" emerges out of giant "" Christmas presents - of - the - mind "" until he realizes he 's just daydreaming ! See this , Christmas lovers -- and if you 're a stoner , save your stash -- this film will make you think you 're hallucinating ... without drugs !"	0
I ca n't recommend this film as a date movie . Gary Oldman 's semi - autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent , Beckettian account of one of Dante 's circles of hell , frankly . At the centre of it is Ray Winstone , who has done this sort of character before but never as well . The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that 's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration , self - loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie . It 's an acting masterclass.Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long - suffering wife , who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour . Charlie Creed - Miles does an able turn as the fuse - lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for . Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors , maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor . 4/10	0
"Is there a book titled "" How to Make a Movie with Every ' Man vs. Nature ' Cliché Imaginable "" ? If not , Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects . Ants does n't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime . I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes . The set - up , the characters , the various sub - plots , the death scenes , and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases , much better . It 's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they 're all basically the same movie.And can someone please tell me what in God 's name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey - turd of a movie ?

"A major moneymaker for RKO Radio , Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots . O'Brien and Scott argue over teaching methods , while their students vie for the affections of Anne Shirley . O'Brien 's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over Tokyo . Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese , but the mortally wounded Scott manages to set fire to a gas truck , providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers . Stylistically , Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films , with moments of subtle poignancy ( the death of trainee Eddie Albert ) alternating with scenes of ludicrous "" Yellow Peril "" melodrama ( the Japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless Americans ) . Though it ca n't help but seem dated today , Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort ( the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of Robert Ryan , who 'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940.Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film , please contact me at : iamaseal2@yahoo.com"	1
"This is really a great unknown movie . Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés . This movie relied on the actor 's talent and it was pulled off . It even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it was n't overdone . Once in the Life is what a crime drama is supposed to be , not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in . I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all.Now onto the actors themselves . Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal . It 's a shame that he 's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie . Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne 's junky half - brother . Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film . Paul Calderon was perfect as a grease monkey / drug lord . I loved his acting since "" King of New York "" .

I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes , but it was a huge dissapointment.The settings and masks are great , but that is the only good aspect of the film . All other things are really annoying . Mark Wahlberg is not acting , he is just in the movie , looking stupid . The other actors are also not very good.But the worst point of all , is the story . It is absolutely ridiculous ! For example : the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground , but the humans don`t attack them , no , they wait until they are up again ! This is just one example for the stupid story , but it would take too long to tell them all .	0
"I love old Burt Reynolds movies . They 're funnier and better than every other movie combined . They might as well have stopped making movies after "" Cannonball Run 2 "" , but I guess how could they have known that there were n't going to be any more good ones ? Man this movie 's good . Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot , and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand , looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way . Burt and Loni , those were the days ! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner . I sure loved that advertisement !

"In my mind , this remains one of the very best depictions of Superman on TV , as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period.This series paid homage to both the Superman films of the ' 70s/'80s and the Superman comics series "" reboot "" of 1986-onward ( "" Man of Steel , "" "" Superman Vol 2 , "" "" Action Comics , "" "" Adventures of Superman , "" etc ) . The opening score and titles were stirring , based on the John Williams score from the films , updated for a Saturday morning action series . Marv Wolfman , one of the main contributors to the comics reboot ( writer of "" Adventures of Superman "" ) was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series . Overall , the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid - friendly.Superman was presented as believable , strong , and iconic . His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation . The Daily Planet characters Lois , Jimmy , and Perry were portrayed well . One of my favorite appearances was by Wonder Woman , and the story revolved around her home island of Themyscira ( "" Paradise Island "" ) . Both her design and that of her mother Hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted Wonder Woman comic book series of the era , and it seemed like an equally well - done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same.The one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on DVD / Blu - ray !

"While in her deathbed , Ann Lord ( Vanessa Redgrave ) repeats the name "" Harris "" and recalls the day on the 50 's when she was an aspirant singer and traveled from New York to be the maid of honor of her wealthy friend Lila Wittenborn ( Mamie Gummer ) in Newport . Ann Grant ( Claire Danes ) is welcomed by Lila 's alcoholic and reckless brother Buddy ( Hugh Dancy ) in the Wittenborn 's cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) , who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine . Later the bride - to - be confesses her true feelings about Harris to Ann . However , when Ann meets Harris , she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with Buddy . Meanwhile Ann 's daughters , the insecure and unstable Nina Mars ( Toni Collette ) and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford ( Natasha Richardson ) , are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved.""Evening "" has one of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie , with magnificent performances . The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother . The locations , costumes , set decoration , cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome . Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film . Why motherhood is so important in the story ? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father ? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together , if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York ? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross ? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love ? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end ? It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story . My vote is seven.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Ao Entardecer "" ( "" In the Eventide "" )"	1
I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission , and let me tell you , you 'll watch anything under those circumstances . Not this piece of sh*t though.The first five minutes set the tone by weak porn - movie quality acting , weird out - of - the - blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior . It gets worse after that . This movie does not have one single saving grace , and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch . It 's just horrible . I 've seen quite many movies in my life and I 'm not one of those snobby know - all critics , I mean I 'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they 're bad .

"Falls into the film category of "" Way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously "" . Whereas Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth or My Boyfriend 's Back know they are bad , Scarecrows does n't . Evil Dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre , that Scarecrows is simply out of place . < br />Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane . The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc , but nothing comes . Although the men are obviously the scarecrows , there is no explanation.Knowing this film is too serious for it 's own good may produce some grins . I do n't recall if Joe Bob Briggs ever previewed Scarecrows , but I believe that he would n't stoop this low . However , with an IMDb rating of over 6 , there are many people that disagree ."	0
"Michael Caton - Jones 's Scottish period piece bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of the same name ... The film opens in the Scottish highlands , with Robert Roy McGregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Graham 's cattle ... The scene then switches to a sword - fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs , adorned shirts , soft colored coats , paleface make - up and conventional gestures ... MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose ... When he enters an ill - advised trade agreement with Montrose , he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montrose 's evil - doers ... The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie , though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape ... When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers , the action becomes well understood , ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade ... Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character ... He is intelligent , fair and virile ... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community ... He is a loving father , a passionate lover , and a noble husband , driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains ... He 'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust ... < br />Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife , a proud peasant woman , brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat ... Lange 's lines are filled with dignity and integrity : ' I will think on you dead , until my husband makes you so . And then I will think on you no more . 'John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis , ruthless with money and tempered by the English court 's fashion for foppery ... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service ... Honor , in his view , seems a quaint notion ... He has two objectives : ruin the reputation of his rival , the Duke of Argyle , and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor ... He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders ' homes , to kill their people and their livestock ... Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero , is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer ... He is a penniless British aristocrat , a nasty ' hired sword ' wonderfully evil , ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist ... His name is Archibald Cunningham ... He turns out to be a liar , a thief and a murderer ... He dismisses himself as ' but a bastard abroad , seeking his fortune and the favors of great men , "" and therefore ca n't care about anyone else : "" Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow . "" He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl ... Cunningham seems pathetic ... He smiles foolishly , and utters words with affected refinement , but not terribly harmful - until a muscular swordsman insults him , and we discover that he 's a cool head and an expert with a sword ... He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination ... And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn , Andrew Keir is Montrose 's rival , the powerful local aristocrat , the Duke of Argyll , one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family ... < br />Set in 18th - century Scotland , and with an atmospheric musical score , ' Rob Roy ' is really a love story between a man and his wife , a recognizably human story , unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibson 's ' Braveheart , ' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords ..."	1
While movie titles contains the word ' Mother ' , the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother 's love for her children.However , The Mother tells a different story.The Mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child , or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child . Here , Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother 's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond , here , he plays Darren , a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother , and sleeping with her daughter as well . Anne Reid , who was a familiar face on TV series , takes up the challenging role of the leading character , May.The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss of her husband , Toots , in a family visit to her son , Bobby . While she befriends Darren , a handyman who is doing some renovation in Bobby 's house , she was shocked to found out that her daughter , Paula , was sleeping with Darren . At the same time , May was coping with life after the death of Toots . Fearing that Harry and Paula do not wanted her , May starts to find her life going off track , until she spends her afternoon with Darren.Darren was nice and friendly to May , and May soon finds some affection on Darren . Instead of treating him like a friend , she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple . Later , May found sexual pleasure from Darren , where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else . And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.The Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life , and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on . This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her , where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May , as she was previously best well known for her various role on TV series . As she do not have much movies in her career resume , The Mother has put her on the critic 's attention . Daniel Craig , on the other hand , had took on a similar role in his movie career , such as Sylvia ( 2003 ) and Enduring Love ( 2004 ) . If his reprising role of James Bond fails , film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career , and The Mother is one of them.The Mother may not be everyone 's favorite , but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones , accompanied by butter and jam .	1
"As other reviewers have noted , this is an unjustly neglected Depression - era film . Directed by Frank Borzage ( two Oscars ) and written by Jo Swerling ( Leave Her to Heaven , The Westerner , Lifeboat , etc . ) , it is a tough - minded , well - structured and -realized move about denizens of a New York City shantytown . They 're grifters , beggars , and women forced into prostitution , but they 're a community of people both good and bad , with loyalties as complex as any group's.Perhaps primary among this movie 's many admirable qualities is the contrast between Spencer Tracy 's character , Bill , and Loretta Young 's Trina . He tough - talking , physically aggressive , and evidently fearless-- but Bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival . While he blusters , Trina actually hangs tough ( if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike ) . Her devotion to him is obvious , and complete . When she becomes pregnant , she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave , or "" I 'll even give up the kid if you 'll only be happy . "" Such is the dignity of Loretta Young 's performance ( at age 20 ) as a quite simple character , that she seems neither weak or dependent , but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it , and wants nothing more ."	1
The premise of this anime series is about bread , of all things to base a plot on ! I truly laughed . The main character has a special bread making power that he was born with , and he goes off to bread baking school . I wish it were available on DVD , and it does n't matter if it 's subtitled or dubbed - it 's that good . Even the theme song alone is funny . At one point in the theme song , there 's an African - Japanese man with an afro on horseback , wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword . These images will not make sense unless you see the anime . You 'll laugh until your sides hurt . It is definitely the most unique anime I have seen thus far .	1
"What 's to like about this movie???It is in colour ! < br />It has some impressive underwater photography ! < br />It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times ! < br />So 3 out of 10 ! < br />Sometimes the music is speeded up ! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in ! < br />Sometimes it is slowed ! As if to convey to the audience it 's about to be time for sympathy ! < br />As another one bites the dust ! As if in a "" spagetti Western "" this has much similarity to ! < br />It 's not that the Italians ca n't produce quality productions ! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like "" Octopus "" numbered about 1 to 7 , screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia - type conflicts ! And they were excellent ! But alas , you wo n't find it here!!!I assumed it was made about 1960s ! Sadly it was 20 years out of date , as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end ! < br />Then there was the razor - sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters ! < br />Amidst it all , either in bar - room brawl or in observing the latest sea - side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark , the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern , as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone 's character development ! < br />At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly , for his ex - wife ! < br />But of course , even if the music fails to awaken our realisation , we have the sinister sound in the baddies ' voices , as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge ! < br />And near the end , someone thought of a twist ! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable ! But stay tuned , folks , for you may find another twist ! If you are watching closely ! To , more or less , warm your heart ! < br />Follow the advice of the hero , and have a few beers along the way ! It 'll make your viewing of "" Night of the Sharks "" more enjoyable ! < br />Then you 'll be ready for something like a "" 007 "" movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over ! ! !"	0
A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child , the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series , even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 . I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels . The dream child was the worst without a doubt , I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels . But I guess they just lost the charm , the story was just ridicules and I was n't happy with where it went . Alice just became more annoying , she 's not Nancy or Kirsten , so her carrying this film on her own did n't work for me . Freddy is also loosing his scare , this was just getting a bit silly.Alice is back and she 's carrying a child , she could n't be happier with her life . But Freddy is also back and he 's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie . But anyways , he wants her child and to be born into the world again . Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too ? Well that 's what A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy 's childhood was like and that maybe that 's the one thing that can defeat him.A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series . I do n't think anyone could be happy with this sequel . Just the story was really silly , I mean it could have possibly worked , but once again , it was just executed the wrong way . I know that if you 're looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series , you should watch it , but I really would n't recommend it , it 's not worth it , at least in my opinion.3/10	0
Anyone who does not find this movie funny , does not understand simple comedy . This movie is not a complex comedy , it is full of one liners , and sight gags , and will make anyone who wants to laugh , laugh ... The alien who is doing a Nicholson impression will crack you up !	1
SPOILERS < br />A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and THE BLUES BROTHERS . NEXT MOVIE has no plot , has no pacing , really has no anything of what defines a movie ... but it is funny . And for what it is worth , Cheech and Chong show some heart.Well , in this little paragraph I put in the plot , but being that four - fifths of the movie , nothing happens that would usually start a story . I will just say that Cheech 's cousin shows up.Was there no other funnier moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice ? What about the rooster ? Was that Pee - Wee Herman 's first movie appearance ? You would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it . I do n't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it awesome , but the movie has heart and hey , my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7 .	1
"2002 's undeservedly popular "" I Love the 80 's "" is an inane , idiotic , offensive and downright disgusting pop - culture mess of a show that was the first in a long - line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1 , which was at one time the only real music - oriented channel left on TV ! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter , I forget which one now , of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever . Out of sheer morbid curiosity ( I 'd guess that 's what you 'd call it ) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look - see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap . At least I can honestly say that I was n't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement - level to begin with . The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 's and what was and was n't culturally significant or popular ( which is what I was expecting to see ) , but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god - awful no - name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills * rolls eyes* ... more like lack - thereof if you ask me ! It 's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so - called "" humor "" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one - liner they shot off one after another ! Altogether , I have no problem in saying that "" I Love the 80 's "" was / is trash of the lowest denominator , and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore ."	0
Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada , I am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film.No one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about Ada Lovelock , her colleagues or the product of her endeavors.Likewise , no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained.As a sci - fi film , this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure . Somehow , the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer -- with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary . I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd.As a drama film , this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure . Somehow , the writer / director manages to fill eighty - five minutes with constant , unnecessary , annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing . I doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction.I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada . The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that I would have otherwise . I am still angry that I wasted the time that it took to see it . Only that I might more effectively criticize this movie , I wish that I were more articulate .	0
Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen ! ! This person should never make another movie!!I ca nt believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience . YOu have have wasted every cent . No concept of real life . I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back . EVER ! ! ! Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm embarrassed for them ! All of you should be ashamed . If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years . Please never watch this movie . I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so .	0
"People forget that there have been several King Kong ripoffs- Congo , King Kong Vs . Godzilla , King Kong ( 1976 ) , they all ripoff one another , but YETI stands on its own . It only borrows one element from King Kong and that is the animal 's attraction with one female.The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot ( not like King Kong)and archeologists have been fascinated it , at one time they did exist , but there is no scientific data to prove it.This movie is hard to find , but its worth watching it . The first time I watched it was on "" Elvira 's Mistress of the Dark Shows "" in the early 1980 's . It sent chills down my spine as a kid , especially when the YETI got mad . I saw it again , around 1:00am on ABC about 2 to 3yrs ago . Seeing it again made me appreciate it more , it has some overall good effects ( for its time ) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog , and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes . Also the music is pretty cool , its very YETI like . : -)Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere.Vote 7 and half out of 10 ."	1
"I registered just to make this comment ( which pretty much echos some of the ones here already ) The acting is worse than subpar , it expounds on commonly held stereotypes , has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification ( all bod no brain ) , and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.including but not limited to "" allright lets see what these guys can do "" I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians , you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves . Eddie Griffin 's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way . He may or may not be a good actor but this movie does n't allow for that kind of character exploration . You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys ? Oceans 11 . This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.Even the cars ca n't make up for this fluke of a movie . That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly . It just sucks ."	0
With this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television , I decided to pop Revolt of the Zombies into the DVD to pass the time . Even while realizing the era from which it was coming , I was sorely disappointed . It started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score ( what - no brooding music ? ) and then the rather slow moving opening sequences . Gosh , I figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have SOME chills to it ( White Zombie , with Bela Lugosi , certainly did ) but this had none . Zero . It was scarcely even dramatic ( except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone ) . Like the equally dull King of the Zombies , this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own , but nothing more .	0
This has to be one of the best , if not the best film i have seen for a very , very long time . Had enough action to satisfy an fan , and yet the plot was very good . I really enjoyed the film , and had me hooked from start to finish.Added blood and gore in there , but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film , and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think.It is a must watch for anyone . Seen many reviews , slating the film , but to be fair , most the films that get bad reviews , turn out to be some of the best . this proves it once again.Rent this film , buy this film , just go out and watch this film . You will not be disappointed .	1
"Unbelievably awful film . I watched part of this on T.V. recently . My jaw dropped as I watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind - numbing drivel . Not a single line from the master of one - liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle . It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield 's body , slap him around and scream , "" How could you ? "" I know many films are done in haste , hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme . But please , Hollywood , show a little respect for your audience . It 's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe . The bottom of the cesspool , even by Sunday afternoon television standards ."	0
"This movie is another horror anthology . It is rather good , but it could have used a bit more . I compare it to "" Doctor Terror 's House of Horrors "" , though in this one the title fits . It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house . The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in . He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house . This one is sort of predictable , but it does throw a few twists in the end . The next story is a bit more unpredictable , and you really do not know where the heck it is going . This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch . This guy buys the house , but it is not the house that takes center stage , but a rather strange wax museum . The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee . This one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter . The problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough . It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion . Then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop . The actor really gets what he paid for . Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened . Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I do n't think it really explained Cushing 's story much at all . I think they needed a bit more back story for that one . All in all though it was an interesting set of stories ."	1
A mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks ' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom , this is really as bad as some people say it is!The laugh - track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!However , it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Cleavon Little . His embarrassment shows through in every scene . He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!Truly the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse !	0
"Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere , and some okay shots that might harken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days , the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.The film is about Erroll Babbage ( Gere ) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire . His office thrusts upon him his replacement , Allison Lowry ( Claire Danes , STARDUST ) , who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job . And that job ai n't very fun . He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction . Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his "" flock "" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement . But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods are n't . He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them . Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants ' pasts . It is this "" good justification "" that challenges the audience on some level , letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out - of - touch he 's become ( by being too close to his job).When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll 's "" area "" , he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock . But how could he know ? Is Erroll that good at his job ? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back . Their battles become as fierce as Erroll 's need to find this missing girl.Although the set - up for the story was okay , it did n't have any umpf ! I will give credit to Richard Gere , however , who plays the Erroll character very well . Battling retirement . Worried about everyone who 's near his flock . Disgusted with those he 's responsible for overseeing . Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does . Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere . But beyond him there 's not much else . Some of the sets are okay ( dark and dangerous ) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films . But that suspension has limits . The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes . Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no - no . Or trampling through a crime scene . Or moving evidence . It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes ' character , Allison . She 's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we 're never privy to what her intension might be : Will she stay or leave ? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay ? This is n't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground , but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up ."	0
"I really enjoyed The 60 's . Not being of that generation ( I 'm waiting for "" The 80 's "" ) it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era.One major problem in the movie , however , was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families . According to promos I saw for the movie on NBC , the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960 's America . Now , I may have missed something , but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family.I really think that The 60 's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors ( all of which are very talented . ) This is very visible at the end of the first part ( about two hours in ) of the mini - series.Very good movie !"	1
What a fun filled , sexy movie ! They certainly do n't make them like this anymore . 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures . The tone is oddly innocent , as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations , rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters . It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant . Richard O ' Sullivan literally gets ' Randi'(sic ) . The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school . My special interest in ' Au Pair Girls ' is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake . If any actress has ever looked better naked ( she 's slim but wonderfully curvy ) , or clothed , come to that ( I 've loved her since the original run of UFO - who else could carry off a purple wig ! ) , I 'll eat my hat .	1
"I 've watched this movie a number of times , and found it to be very good . This movie is also known as "" Castle Of Terror "" , "" Coffin Of Terror "" , and "" Dance Macabre "" . Barbara Steele , is her usual beautiful / creepy self . George Riviere , the male lead , does a good job with his role . The whole movie is dripping with atmosphere , and there is a good deal of tension throughout . The camera angles are good and the acting , for the most part , is n't bad . This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening . I have the DVD uncut version , which is far superior to the edited TV version . Grab some popcorn , turn out the lights , settle back and enjoy . John R. Tracy"	1
DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B - fantasy movie fans ; this barely 80-minute travesty of film - making features everything hecklers can ask for -- non - existent plotting , terrible acting ( save for at least a raspy - sounding old lady ) , laughable scripting and schlock editing , and bargain - basement style background settings . There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting ( in particular , the lead does n't have ANYTHING appealing about him ) , and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F - grade material . If that 's not enough , then how about the lack of a compelling plot ( which this movie has nothing of the sort ) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey ? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 ) be topless and/or scantily clad ; 2 ) get raped ; 3 ) have sex with the hero ; 4 ) all of the above . In addition , the background music is hideous ; a bizarre mess of electronic noise , cheesy choral bursts , and blaring orchestral cacophony . Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested , DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at ( and believe me , there 's plenty of that in here ) . Otherwise , I do not recommend this 100th - grade CONAN wanna - be to anyone in the least .	0
"Sitting , Typing   Nothing is the latest "" what if ? "" fest offered by Vincenzio Natali , and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers . One is having relationship problems , got canned from his job ( because of relationship problems ) and the police are out to get him ( because of his job and his relationship problems ) . The other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home , is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her Mom to claim she was molested when he does n't buy cookies from him . Oh yeah , the police are after him too , after the Mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him.Man , what a day.What if you could make all of this disappear ? That is the whole premise behind ' Nothing ' . The two fools realize , the cops , the girl scout , the cars , the lawn , the road , everything   disappear . There 's nothing but white space ! This is an interesting concept I thought . I also looked at the time of this , 30 minutes had gone in the movie , and I still had an hour left in the movie . Could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes ? Although the actors try , 60 minutes IS a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie . But the two actors , whom are life - long friends with each other and the director , have such great repertoire with each other , that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do . There are lots of supernatural elements , but it 's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing ."	1
The Perfectly Stupid Weapon . I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal 's movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie . The plot is predictable , the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene .	0
"Dumland focuses on the lives of one ( American ? ) family ... The father ; a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities . The mother ; who appears to be a paranoid psychotic , never really says much . The son ; an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow . The animation is simple and crude , but does suite the stories and the characters . The episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch.com website , but have now been released on DVD . There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a brief synopsis follows:1- The Neighbor : We meet the next door neighbor , and find out three things about him ... he has a really nice shed , he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks.2- The Treadmill : We find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise , but the husband does n't really think it 's a good idea . In the end , the exercise treadmill is victorious.3- The Doctor : The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire ... the doctor 's examination is quite thorough ( if not unconventional ) but the diagnosis is "" you are perfectly normal "" ( but we knew that).4- A Friend Visits : After an altercation with the new clothes hoist , a friend comes to visit ( Believe it or not , he has one ! but after we meet him we can understand why ) , no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are.5- Get The Stick : We meet another neighbor , he has a stick stuck in his mouth ( although we never find out how it got there ) . Unfortunately , removing the stick from his neighbor 's mouth ends up being harder ( and more violent ) than expected ... but he is victorious in the end ... Jesus some people can be ungrateful!!!6- My Teeth Are Bleeding : This was my favorite episode ... and was also the most mind- numbingly repetitive and annoying ( hmm , what does that say about me ? ? ) . Not sure why the son 's teeth started bleeding , but believe me when I say it was minimal to the plot of the story . Which is an oxymoron , as the story had no plot . But did have a funny ending ( involving a fly)!!7- Uncle Bob : After meeting Uncle Bob , and Uncle bob 's wife , we get a distinct feeling that the Dumbland gene - pool is very shallow . Uncle Bob is a sickly fellow ( I sha n't elaborate , lest I spoil it for you ) . Uncle Bob 's wife definitely wears the pants in his family ... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist ( and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard).8- Ants : After the home gets infiltrated with ants , and a misbegotten attempt to bug - spray them goes awry ... he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug - spray and starts hallucinating . The ants put on a fabulous song and dance show ... he goes berserk trying to kill them , winds up in a full body plaster ... and lets just say , the ants get their vengeance in the end.As bad as these stories are , there is something that kept compelling me to watch them . They do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors . David Lynch . Maybe they were an outlet for him , to get rid of some of his violent thoughts ? ? I did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes . Many aspects are absurdly funny ! !"	1
This so called remake is terrible . I went to see this tonight .. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle . But within the first half an hour , we knew that this is a disaster . It not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster . The script had loopholes , the editing was untidy quite a few times . Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job . Amitabh was alright .. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful . Ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment . Lets not even get started about the new guy Prashant .. one would n't be proud to start off a career with something like this . Rajpal Yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs could n't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice . Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today . All in all , RGV who I thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors India has had .. failed miserably . He took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it .	0
"Many neglect that this is n't just a classic due to the fact that it 's the first 3D game , or even the first shoot-'em - up . It 's also one of the first stealth games , one of the only(and definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well - rounded gaming experience in general . With graphics that are terribly dated today , the game thrusts you into the role of B.J.(don't even * think * I 'm going to attempt spelling his last name ! ) , an American P.O.W. caught in an underground bunker . You fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes(but , let 's face it , most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon , surround you with Nazis and send you out to waste one of the Nazi leaders ) . The graphics are , as I mentioned before , quite dated and very simple . The least detailed of basically any 3D game released by a professional team of creators . If you can get over that , however(and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ) , then you 've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game . The game play consists of searching for keys , health and ammo , blasting enemies(aforementioned Nazis , and a "" boss enemy "" per chapter ) of varying difficulty(which , of course , grows as you move further in the game ) , unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms . There is a bonus count after each level is beaten ... it goes by how fast you were(basically , if you beat the ' par time ' , which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat , and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in , they are even challenging after many play - throughs ) , how much Nazi gold(treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed . Basically , if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned , you get a bonus , helping you reach the coveted high score placings . The game ( mostly , but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing ... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see . You can either run or walk , and amongst your weapons is also a knife ... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard , as is gunshots . Many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you , meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them ... nearly silently . In your inventory , you can get no less than four weapons and two keys ... more about the weapons later . The keys unlock certain doors . Most doors in the game are n't locked ... only two kinds need keys , and these keys are only introduced in later levels(you restart in levels , resetting weaponry , health , score and lives in each chapter ) . Much of the later game is spent looking for them . Now , as I just alluded to , this game , like many of the period(late 80 's , early 90 's ) , is based on collecting extra lives ... personally , I think it 's completely and utterly useless(it was mercifully dropped from here on end ... I think ( ? ) , from the next 3D shooter and onwards ) , since you can save anytime you want and ' using a life ' resets weaponry , health and ammo , like starting on a new chapter(which is a real pain in later levels , where you * need * heavier artillery ) . Now , I shall beat around the bush no longer ... moving on to the guns ! You start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close ) and a pistol ... nothing special , but good for conserving ammo , unlike the next two bad boys . Your third weapon is a German SMG ... a sub - machine - gun . It 's faster and automatic , and some later enemies use it . And the last one ... is nothing short of a Gatling gun ! Oh yeah ! Think T2 . Think Predator . Think about unloading massive amounts of lead into Nazi fiends with such a gun . It 's every bit as entertaining as it sounds . Most of the boss enemies use this , though , so be prepared . I wo n't reveal the identities of these boss enemies , however ... that 's for each player to discover for him(or her)self . The sound is excellent ... very crisp and realistic . As you hear the tear of a machine - gun firing , the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a Nazi yelling surprised or a warning in German , you truly feel like you are there , trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems . That segues me nicely into the level design ... as you run through seemingly countless , nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further , you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood . I almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep , lots of humidity and unusual warmth ... ) from playing . Though the level of detail is n't terribly high , what there is is great . Remains of victims , guards ' quarters and countless Nazi symbols ... the list goes on . The game also features quite a bit of gore ... for it 's limited graphics engine , John Romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game . What is there left to say ... the first of its kind , and it 's no wonder this spawned countless others 3D shooters . Sure , weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such ) did n't come around until the next entry into the genre ... Doom ... and it was Duke Nukem 3D that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right , adding vertical dimensions to it ) , and jumping did n't come around until a third , later title(the first Quake , possibly ? Fellow gamers , help me out here ) ... but all of those games , as well as the rest of the genre , owe their existence to this one . So load up the Luger , open the door to enter the bunker and step into B.J. 's shoes ... he deserves the recognition , even(or maybe even especially ? ) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared . I recommended this to all fans of 3D games . 8/10"	1
Rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to Planet Earth ... Of * course * Planet Earth is better - it has much much more of the same . Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series , and as such , is inevitably inferior and simplified . But that is not comparing like with like.As a feature - length documentary ( or actually as a feature - length anything ) , it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life ( unless you choose to traverse the Earth in helicopters with long - range cameras for years on end , and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth , which - lets face it - is unlikely).On the narration : yes everyone in the UK - very much including me - adores David Attenborough , and there 's little excuse for him not to be narrating here , but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three . He was n't a presenter on Planet Earth , just a narrator , and I 'm sure he 's modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a Good Thing.Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe , majesty and glory . All reviewers agree on that . Those who love it ( ie . everyone ) will / should go on to see an buy Planet Earth . So three cheers for its cinematic release , and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on DVD rather than the Planet Earth box - set . But as works of art they 're not in competition here people.The Earth is big enough for both .	1
this movie probably had a $ 750 budget , and still managed to surpass Titanic . i rented this the day i crashed my mom 's car , and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief ! it has to be tied with ' The Assult of the Killer Bimbos ' . Things to look for are : 1 . The drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 . The bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 . The Flinstone - like screech out driving 4 . The clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed ( do n't worry , i 'm not ruining any surprises , for it 's soooo predictable ) 5 . The guy who finds it necessary to howl . 6 . The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen . 7 . The hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest . 8 . the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall . 9 . last , but not least , the wonderful special effects -- especially the stab in the boob that made a ... heaven help me ... popping noise.enjoy!<br / >	1
Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction . 7 days - 7 suicides . It does nt get more depressing than this . Movie rating : 8/10 Music rating : 10/10	1
I would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason ( Herb ) Evers constant harping on experiment . Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting . Yet , as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done . Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune , and his overacting is exactly that.Most of the actors in this B classic were rather good actors , minus Evers and the showgirls . If you watch this movie , you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line , that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose . < br />The special effects were par for the course in a B movie such as this one . In hindsight , there is n't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie .	0
John Waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones , considering it cut down on all of the campiness and outright vulgarity which seem to litter most of his previous work . Sure , the nudity and the sexual references are still there , at least it is presented in a fashion < br />that can not be deemed too foul or disgusting . Due to some great casting choices , this film really brought out the silliness associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist . Funny and somewhat lighthearted ( if that is possible for Waters ) , this is one of those films I would watch on a rainy day .	1
I reflect back to the days when I held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when I was 16 . The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years . Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments . That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter . But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth . < br />The three main characters well played by all three actors ( Kerry Wahington - Lanisha , Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria ) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations . They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day . The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models . These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day . They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with . Finding true love in a male , having good friends that you can depend on , gaining some respect / love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life . This is were this film cross the race , age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped . < br />The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head , by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods . Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best . The one thing I know about ( African Americans and Hispanics ) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent . This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves . < br />The HOPE FACTOR : I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did ` Today is a good day . ' Yes poverty still exists , racism , sexism , and any other ism that we can added . Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self - destructive , everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future . I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision . I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think , reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place.<br / >	1
"I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the names of John Huston , Raquel Welch , Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover . I found the Brazilian title very weird , but I decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like "" Switch "" . However the non - sense story is awful and hard to be described . Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed ) is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood telling that she is to be Myra Breckinridge ( Raquel Welch ) and claiming half the property of his uncle Buck Loner ( John Huston ) . Along the days , Myra and her alter - ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle 's academy with kinky sex . In a certain moment , the messy screenplay is so confused that I believe the whole story was only a mind trip of Myron induced by the accident . Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flick . My vote is three.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Homem & Mulher Até Certo Ponto "" ( "" Man & Woman Up to a Point "" )"	0
"How unfortunate , to have so many of my "" a "" list , and good "" b "" list actors agree to do this movie , but they did , and that is what sucked me into watching it . I had never heard of this movie , but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover , and James Woods in the background how bad can it be ? In a word Very ! This movie starts o.k . has some twists and turns , then just lays an egg . The ending was so weak , it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending . How ironic a for a movie titled "" The end game "" to have such a poor one . These are the types of movies that can move "" a "" list actors to the "" b "" list in hurry . I hope Cuba Gooding JR , and James Woods do n't make a habit of this ."	0
All of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean , tongue - in - cheek humor . Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work . This is not a blockbuster , bigger - than - life affair . This is campy , slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood 's best ( and very versatile ) actors . Piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee , once.If you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed , you got ta see Dimitri do his piece as Morone.I gave it a 7 .	1
I appreciated the photography , the textures , the colours and often , unlike one comment , the lighting . What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline . I found it often disjointed , badly edited and at times difficult to follow . My version was 110 minutes , IMDb shows one at 125 m . Possibly the cuts and subtitles did n't help . I applaud any films that escape from the Hollywood mould but this left me disappointed . Miss Gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine , I just wanted a little more dialogue . If anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one , try ' Hideous Kinky'with Kate Winslet .	1
The premise was intriguing , but sadly this film just does n't do any justice to it . The casting was quite good , and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent ( overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect .... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial ) , characters were identified exclusively by on - screen coke usage ( and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development ) , and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story . A very forgettable film .	0
"One wonders why this picture was made at all : the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous , the characters ( experienced loner cop versus younger one , quite fascinated ) quite predictable , the ending totally murky and impossible to understand ( maybe after several viewings but you 'd have to have a masochistic tendency for that ; the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it 's all about)and the acting is bad . Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include "" Seven "" and "" Silence of the lambs "" ? If so , it is a total failure . It was quite a success though ( and has a sort of cult - status as the first French serial killer film)and , it seems , considered as a good product to export . Strange ."	0
I thought I had seen this movie , twice in fact . Then I read all the other reviews , and they did n't quite match up . A man and three young students , two girls and a boy , go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings . I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw , despite the discrepancies in the reviews . Therefore I 'm putting my review back : If you like the occasional ' B ' movie , as I do , then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you ! Whether it 's setting the sleep timer , and nodding off to your favorite movie - bomb , or just hanging out with friends . Boggy Creek , the mute button , and you 've got a fun night of improv . Look out ! Is the legend true ? I think we just might find out , along with a not - so - stellar cast . Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film ? Does our blonde , manly , young hero have any chest hair ? Will the exceptionally high - tech Technicolor last the entire film ? You 'll have to watch to find out for yourself .	0
"This mini - series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations . SOTD falls somewhere between "" Kung - Fu "" and "" H R Pufnstuff "" on the entertainment spectrum . If it were n't so long ( nearly 3 hours ) I think that kids would like it quite a bit . It 's got adventure , action , "" cliffhanger scenes "" , and not too much romance or other "" icky "" stuff . When you 're young , you 're not too critical of flexing rubber swords , campy acting , and scenes that are repeated . ( At least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie , just as was done in old - time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed . ) Finally , kids are usually more accepting of American English dialogue coming out of the mouths of Asian actors . ( Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non - Asian actors . ) < br />I was going to give this movie three stars , but I felt like the director , producers , and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project . This movie is not art , but , like painting your house , it actually took some time , effort , and discipline to get it made.Overall , not a recommended use for your time , but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini - van.Oh , yeah ... hey , IMDb ! "" Dialogue "" is the preferred and traditional spelling . Your spell - checking seems to think that "" dialog "" is the proper spelling . While "" dialog "" is acceptable , both Webster 's and the OED consider it an alternative form ."	0
"If Saura had n't done anything like this before , Iberia would be a milestone . Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture , but he has done a lot like this before , and though we can applaud the riches he has given us , we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding ( 1981 ) , Carmen ( 1983 ) , El Amore Brujo ( 1986 ) , Sevillanas ( 1992 ) , Salomé ( 2002 ) and Tango ( 1998 ) . I would choose Saura 's 1995 Flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document , next to which Iberia pales.Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz ( 1860 - 1909 ) and in particular his "" Iberia "" suite for piano . Isaac Albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re - formatting for a non - Spanish audience . He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers . His "" Iberia "" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of Liszt , Dukas and d'Indy . He traveled around performing his compositions , which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies , not as homogenized as Ravel 's Bolero but moving in that direction . Naturally , the Spanish have repossessed Albéniz , and in Iberia , the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles . But the source is a tamed and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt Spanishness of pure flamenco . Flamenco , coming out of the region of Andalusia , is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane , Hispano - Arabic , and Jewish cultures . Iberia simply is the peninsula comprising Spain , Portugal , Andorra and Gibraltar ; the very concept is more diluted . < br />Saura 's Flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music , singing , dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style , the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion ; they just are . Saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists . In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers , musicians , and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens , flats , and mirrors arranged by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro , another of the Spanish filmmaker 's important collaborators . The beginnings and endings of sequences in Flamenco are often rough , but atmospheric , marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices . Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over , sigh , or laugh ; or somebody just unexpectedly says something . In Flamenco more than any of Saura 's other musical films it 's the rapt , intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé 's that is the "" story "" and creates the magic . Because Saura has truly made magic , and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.Iberia is in a similar style to some of Saura 's purest musical films : no narration , no dialogue , only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region , beginning with a pianist playing Albeniz 's music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing . In flamenco music , the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice , and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music . It relates to other songs in other ethnicities , but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly - beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention . Then comes the clapping and the foot stomping , and then the dancing , combined with the other elements . There is only one flamenco song in Iberia . If you love Saura 's Flamenco , you 'll want to see Iberia , but you 'll be a bit disappointed . The style is there ; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there . But Iberia 's source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience ."	1
"I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it 's one of the worst films I 've ever seen . The acting is fair , but the plot is totally ridiculous . A killer is born because of all the "" energy used to make the movie "" and if the film is burned the killer will die ? How unbelievable is that ? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example , all of a sudden the man mentions "" Are n't you trying to complete the film because your mother could n't ? "" So we 're supposed to go along with this ? We had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film . The movie really did n't spotlight on anyone , we did n't know anything about the main people who survived except Ringwald 's character was a whiney actress , the guy was on the set when the people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother . Not truly diving in to know who they are . Seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings . The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed . Anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap , obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making . I ca n't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture . It 's not funny , it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film . I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene , which believe you me was n't hard at all to do . It 's a disgrace and I 'm deeply sorry I wasted an hour and a half watching the mess . 1/10 ."	0
the author of the book , by the same title , should not have let her name be used for this movie . if you have read the book , this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details . the movie adds nothing , in terms of artistic merit , to the book 's own literary achievement.for those who have not read the book : you will also be disappointed . not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace , it does n't offer anything more while it is moving slowly ( like character development , for example ) . some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie , but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle -- its fairly tame and not imaginative at all .	0
I do n't know what you guys are inhaling , but please stop . This movie was complete trash.Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable , cute , sweet , loving , and extremely fun to watch . He had that innocence but at the same time , he was strong as well.This new kid , Alex ? Annoying as all hell ! Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkin 's charm and grace , failing miserably at that.The villains , complete crap . Harry and Marv , they were such an entertaining on screen team . They were comedic , they were humorous , and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more , which is what a good villain is suppose to do . These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern , absolutely PERFECT for those roles . On the other hand , in 3 , we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again , try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains . Not saying they were horrible , but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining . More on the corny side actually.Then we got the actual movies . Part 1 and 2 , classics . Memorable . Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions . It makes you fall in love with the story , and care about the characters . Simply , memorable and close to being masterpieces . Part 3 ? Masterpiece of crap . Enough said.All and all , I do n't know why people like this . I think people really do n't know what a good movie is anymore . Its a crappy sequel rip - off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that I wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of.Run , run away from this garbage . And lets not even start with Part 4 !	0
"Ah , the infamous "" Guinea Pig "" series ... I honestly have to say that I 've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ( "" He Never Dies"",""Mermaid in a Manhole "" , and "" Flower of Flesh and Blood "" being the exceptions ... and even those are n't great by any means ... ) , but "" Devil 's Experiment "" just plain blows . There is nothing realistic - looking going on here , other than the climactic ( or perhaps anti - climactic , depending on how you view it ) eyeball piercing scene . The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to "" hideous "" ( more often sometimes "" hilarious "" ) tortures . "" Flower of Flesh and Blood "" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake "" snuff "" material , but that film also falls flat on the realism level . I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries , and they 've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "" extreme "" film - making , but "" Devil 's Experiment "" just does n't hold up . Worth a look if you are a die - hard , if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about , but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that 's only for the needle - through - the - eye scene ..."	0
First of all , we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you 'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same . His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far ... and counting . The story begins in the ( not so far ) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth . The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story . About that . Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you 'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down . Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good . But that does n't mean that the ending wo nt pull your nerves , cause its pretty good . As far as the direction goes , it is prefect . Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better . So , if you are getting ready to see a Sci - Fi movie or some action , you 'll miss it . B There should be more movies like this .	1
Gung Ho was a good idea , however it is to much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition . In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson(Michael Keaton ) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese auto company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town . Two things come at you . First why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do so , and so well at that ? Secondly can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape American labor costs ? It makes the film 's premise then that the Number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its ' top competitors(aside from Germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic . Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time . But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard ca n't keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding . Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its ' lightweight feel . The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans . His No.2 man Saito who supposedly does n't like Americans all that much does n't think so . I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be . It would have made the film more interesting .	0
""" Mechenosets "" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I 've ever seen . The name of the film can be translated in English as "" the sword - bearer "" . The main hero ( Sasha ) was born with one exceptional ability : he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand . At first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings . But it is not about Mechenosets . He hardly can be even called the anti - hero . I think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good , justice and love . In his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him ( except his mother ) . Every his step is stained with blood ; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him . And suddenly he meets her . She does n't need the idle talks and explanations . She loves him for what he is . She does n't care what he did . The fact that he 's next to her is more important than anything else . But soon she finds out his secret : he kills two people ( her ex - boyfriend and his bodyguard ) to protect her before her very eyes . Even after that she could n't escape her feelings . They try to run but it 's hart to hide . Finally they have a serious car accident . He is caged ; she is in a mental hospital . They do n't know anything about each other , but she believes that he 'll save her . He surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her . They run again but they are n't invulnerable . She is wounded , she needs a rest , but police almost catch them . He does n't know what to do , they drive into a corner , and then his sword begins to cut down trees , helicopter around them , but there is no need for it , because she is already dead in his arms , and he is the lonely person in the whole world again ."	1
"Okay , there are a ton of reviews here , what can I possibly add?I will try anyway . < br />The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing . The sets , outdoor locations , costumes are so beautiful and authentic . The music is sweet . The supporting cast is very well done . One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew , played by Roger Rees . His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me . David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit . His is a difficult life , but he remains positive and dignified . < br />The best part of course- is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge . Some have said his portrayal too gruff . I could n't disagree more . His exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh , were n't out of character . He is a terribly disillusioned man who 's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth . < br />During the flashbacks , it 's obvious that he is n't all gruff . This is where we see that there is hope for him . If he was totally gone , his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place . And after all , we are none of us past hoping . I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say . When Scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer 's with Belle , you see him smile regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life "" with a grin on my face . "" Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film . Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.And finally , his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see it . His apology to his nephew Fred , so sincere , so moving , it is the spirit not only of Christmas , but of humanity itself . The joy he brings to Fred , to his wife are so apparent . And the line that gets me every time , "" God forgive me for the time I 've wasted . "" < br />Bravi tutti !"	1
Let me give a quick summery of the film : A rotten , rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam : a rapping genie . Like all genies , he grants 3 wishes but , being good natured , also helps Max with his personal life , as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime . During all this , Kazaam raps from time to time , ( also showcasing Shaq 's dismal rap skills).This movie proves what we all know : Athletes need to stick to sports . I admit that it never looked like an Oscar - worthy movie , but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible . The characters are either unlikable or stupid , the plot is not even worth mentioning , the dialog is a joke , and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem . Hell , even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke . I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big ( no pun intended ) at the time . I honestly can not think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time . Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .	0
"Dear Friends and Family,I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen , then that 's their eternal damnation - just remember kids , "" birth control "" does n't mean "" oral sex "" , I do n't care what the honor student says . On the other hand , even if the senator 's aid quotes himself as a "" bit of a romantic guy "" , he 's still only hitting on a high school girl . If she was my sister , I 'd eat this guys kneecaps.Other than that I found out that Mongolians do n't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments.I think I 'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip , slap , slop . Thank you , and good night ."	0
"We toss around the term "" superstar "" way too lightly these days , but here 's one guy that truly deserves it.I was glued to the set this entire show . The song selection was perfect -- it only contained the songs I actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new songs . I loved that the band was just a five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment . ( With songs of this strength , you do n't need a circus to be entertained).The shots of the crowd were amazing , too . How many performers can affect the original Beatles fans ( now in their 50 's and beyond ) , get young kids to jump up at the opening lines of "" Ca n't Buy Me Love "" and impact everyone in between ? < br />While watching , I also realized that in the wake of John Lennon 's tragic death , Paul McCartney instantly became an afterthought . Paul not only lost John and George ( no matter what their final relations were , it must be hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world ) , but he also lost his wife Linda and never really seemed to garner the acknowledgment Lennon 's murder received . I agree that Lennon 's murder was horrible , but only now did I realize that Paul was sort of forgotten in the aftermath . I was very happy that he 's found love again in Heather.As for those complaining about the audio / video quality , I had no complaints whatsoever ; both were crystal clear on my set . I think these same people will complain about the quality of DVD when the next format comes out ; they 'll never be satisfied.My only regret was not buying a ticket to this show when I had the chance . Thanks to this video I was able to enjoy it.When people remember John Lennon , they will first remember his murder and then his music . I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney , because , if nothing else , he will be remembered for his music first . And let 's hope another lunatic wo n't change this , because the McCartney catalog is pretty good ."	1
"Okay , here 's what I think about Jack Frost . I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought to myself , this looks interesting . I rent it and I take it home . Boy was I right , it is interesting . They put serial killer 's spirits in dreams , in walking corpses and inside every day machines . But this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer . Inside the body of a snowman . I liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape , the pot holder , the snow globe , etc . I like the actor who played Jack , he put some fun into a killer really not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER . That 's right , I said it . FREDDY KRUGGER . It 's that level of "" cool "" . I wish some of the puppet effects were better , the mouth movements could have matched better . But I chalk that up to a small budget . The cast does a great job , there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump . All and all , a great story , good effects , great dialog and a great cast . I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS"	1
I would of given this film a zero out of ten , but i will give it a two . Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film , which is not really a reason . Last Point is that Rani Appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal . I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress . Which is why i did n't enjoy her in this movie kissing Kamal , but its no big deal . Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable , lets actually talk about this film . Is it good or bad , I think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn . Me being a Fantastic critic , you can see my other 250 + review 's by clicking on my name , I have great taste . The movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema , why is there no morale in this movie . Its a biased movie that s not a true story and it stinks . Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick , Man ca nt kiss properly anyway .	0
"This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original . This sequel is n't nearly as fun as part one , and it instead spends too much time on plot development . Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series , but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry . The performances are all adequate , but this time the script lets us down . The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting , so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a "" Trancers "" movie . Unfortunately , the laughs are few and far between , and so , this film is watchable at best ."	0
I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased . A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re - evaluate Waterloo . So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I 'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure.On the surface the story seemed a simple one , man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs , they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband , and then .............  .. well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans . Michael O'Hara ( Orson Welles } himself does n't really know what is going on , he is as confused as the viewer is , and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film . Obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister ( Rita Hayworth } has its moments , but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.So many wonderful things in the film , it has Welles visual style all over it , see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye . The narration from O'Hara is joyously self mocking , and we get good light relief by way of a court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.Yet the film is an oddity , and in fact it 's a choppy viewing experience , because { as I was to find out after } studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour , and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer , but unfair on Welles ' vision . I 'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale , as it is tho , we have a very good and intriguing film , one that sadly only hints at greatness , but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that I 'm glad I own to revisit further . 8.5/10	1
This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I 've ever seen . Oh .... where to start .... Plot ( what little there is ) : Clayton Beresford Jr. ( Hayden Christensen ) , a young billionaire , with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant . Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother 's PA , Samantha , played by Jessica Alba . On the night that these two secretly get married , it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found . Go and figure the odds of that one ! Once on the operating table , Clay finds out the anesthesia is n't working , and he can feel everything and hear everything.Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha , which we are told he 's doing through an annoying voice - over which never seems to stop.If you did n't burst out in laughter yet , you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes . < br />How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon , one nurse , an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist ? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled . Not to mention the medical behavior , which is too preposterous to be taken seriously ... the operating room is n't even kept sterile ... people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up ... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clay 's thoughts , none of which are too fascinating . Ah ... but here 's what it 's all about ... the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money . Believing him to be unconscious , the villains speak freely . Gosh ! What will happen ? < br />Well ... at least there 's no interference from anyone else in the hospital , while an incompetent doctor who 's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery . Not even Clay 's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status . The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha ... but oh no ... could sweet Sam be in on it .... You'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog ... In the end , it would n't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness , because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness , maybe there 's some dumb fun to be had ... Enjoy ...	0
I can not believe the same guy directed this crap and Dracula 2000 . Dracula 2000 was innovative , fresh , and well written , if poorly acted.This pile ca n't even claim that . It starts with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000 . Then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that . Following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow , but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films , having no good tie but the main villain 's name.Even the actor playing Dracula was different ( going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here).Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies .	0
I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock 's lesser known films , because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc . So , that being said , I would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc.Now , that may be overshooting a little bit , The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above , but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s , I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them . As an almost brand new director , there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.Granted , the film does start with , among other things , the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer ( and I use idiot in the definitive manner , the way Stephen King so often does ) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people . I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then , but I think it is one of the most off - putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I 've seen.The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round , but when he meets his match , it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife 's finger . So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman , who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.(spoilers ) There is , for example , a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and , just before going into the building , she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss . This kiss is never explained , and there is also the fact that , even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband , or at least ultimately chooses him , they look into each other 's eyes but do not actually kiss.The film is certainly beautifully photographed , even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years . There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack 's trainer who , in his stone faced expressionism , reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton . Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous , but this is a great sample of his early work .	1
"Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks.Lets face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the extent of her "" talent "" .

If there is a good thing about this movie , I would say it 's that Tommy Chong 's daughter , just for the fact that she 's his daughter ... and then there is that Soap - Opera - ish male lead who 's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive , but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines ?

"No matter how well meaning his "" message "" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting , lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it . You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention . He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer . Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy , predictable and sappy ."	0
NOTHING in this movie is funny . I thought the premise , giving a human the libido of a randy ram , was interesting and should provide for some laughs . WRONG ! There is simply nothing funny about the movie . For example , the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer 's yard is not funny , it borders on obscenity . They are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level , and it just ai nt funny.We all know that dogs will eat anything , anywhere , anytime . The main character doing this with everything , everywhere , everytime is also not funny . It becomes a cliche.Rob Schneider is , I guess , acceptable in the role . By this , I mean that he 's not a bad actor , but with rotten material it 's difficult to comment on quality . However , Coleen Haskell , the other half of the HUMAN - romantic leads ( does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too ? ) , seems embarrassed by the whole thing , as well she should be . She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum , detached from all the other actors in the movie . < br />See this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless , dull , repetitive material .	0
Based on the average short story by horror writer Stephen King about so called ' Sleepwalkers ' ancient and immortal cat - like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them They have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves ' dim ' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people . They have been fleeing humans for century 's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left . The film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town , they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on . The mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin , he does ( Madchen Amick ) and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry . It is not made clear why the mother can not seek out virgins herself- it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy . However his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back , jabbing a pencil in to his ear . The police are called and the hunt is on ! . The son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore . Finally the girl kills the mother- end of movie . This movie is rubbish ! . The acting is variable , from the average Brian Krause to the excellent Alice Krige . The special effects are average , and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time . The direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places . The director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical . Stephen King makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does Mark Hamill , as a puzzled cop . Alice Krige seems to shoulder the film , her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction .	0
""" ASTONISHING "" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box . They must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released . The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals , and murder innocent people just to stay alive . Their skin peels off throughout the film , we also see severed legs , heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set . There is an awful lot of talking b*ll**ks , a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair , before stabbing them in the head , chopping them into bits ... You get the picture . Considering there is no acting talent on display at all , and the gore is laughably unrealistic , what is the point of this whole farrago ? Again looking at the video box , the guy responsible for it is an "" underground cult director "" . Would that be like those weird religious cults where they brainwash you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true ? Because that 's the only possible reason I can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax write - off . Then , on the same paragraph he compares himself to Mike Leigh , Ken Loach and George Romero . HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it . Now you 're just being silly.Do you enjoy this film ? Are you offended by the above opinion ? If so , you must be a member of said cult . Do they pocket your wages ? Do they let you see other family members ? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films till you think he 's the best director since A.Hitchcock ? Do tell ... this sounds like a Panorama special brewing to me .

I was all ready to pan this episode , seeing that this ' Master ' really does n't have any horror films under his belt .. but this is easily the best episode of the season.The acting was good ! ! I do n't know how he wrangled it , but we 've got some real talent in this episode ! And while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise , at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins , something that has been lacking up to this point in the series.I especially liked the bit at the end , not a twist per say , but just a funny little bit where he becomes , as ever , the hen - pecked hubby.Really good effort . Like I 've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes .. but they may someday end up being masters in the future .	1
""" The big goodbye "" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure , in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill . This episodes creates some sort of standard pattern , repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager . After entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game ( represented by the failure of the holodeck 's safety program ) . < br />This concept is used to expand Star Trek 's possibility and enabling a kind of genre - mix . Picard 's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as Film Noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead ( see for example Chandler 's Marlowe stories or Polanski 's all time classic "" Chinatown "" ) . Star Trek never focuses on the story ( mostly it 's a simple "" how - do - we - get - out - of - here "" scenario ) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters . Those Holodeck "" games "" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members . Therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound ( but did Star Trek ever had a technical , scientific point to it , I mean besides some utopic concepts?).""The big goodbye "" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart , a McFadden that hardly ever looked better in a Star Trek episode ( at least the early ones ) and Data has some great scenes , too ( although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp 's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him , for the fact that he 'd done research on that period and its customs ) . Wesley continues turning peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers ( why did n't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off ? ) but all in all this one 's fun ..."	1
With a tendency to repeat himself , Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with ' Paris Texas'.'Land of plenty ' is no exception . Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average - mediocre film even before I went in , Wenders ' ambitions seem to always get the better of him . It 's taken for grated now his films are heavy - handed and bombastic.I were n't sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller . The outcome of Diehl 's character is wholly predicable . Wender 's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying . He was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes.I am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly , this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction.Interesting that Wenders professed that while making ' Paris Texas ' , he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script . Yes , that was Wenders ' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter . His films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess .	0
Well , Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie . The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay . But , although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion ( I am an atheist ) , it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end . Why is this movie so incredibly boring ? I do n't know . It just is and so it is not recommendable .	0
"MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately . Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent , even from the people involved in making it . This film was loathed from day one . While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds ( aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism ) , the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do . It 's not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE , or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS . < br />Undoubtedly the reason is that the film , though outrageously awful , is not lovable , or even likable . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean . As a Hollywood satire it is cold - blooded and mean - spirited , but in a hollow pointless way . MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town , but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy , Shirley Temple , Judy Garland and Gary Cooper . The film seems to imply that everything about Hollywood is by its very nature vile . It seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows , but does n't supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place . The film is also viscously anti - American and anti - establishment and anti - this and anti - that , but all in a superficial , late-1960 's , trendy way . Like CASINO ROYALE ; SKI - DOO ; I LOVE YOU , ALICE B. TOKLAS and other would - be hip epics , MYRA is a middle - aged vision of the hippy - dippy youth culture . It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles . But instead of being cheerfully self - mocking , MYRA makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully ; there 's not a single moment of innocence in it . Its intentions are n't honorable . TIME magazine aptly described it as being "" about as funny as a child molester , "" but it 's not nearly as sympathetic.For instance , poor Mae West bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film , being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse . The octogenarian star obviously did n't know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great - grandsons . But , director Michael Sarne had to know , but he used her anyway . Why ? Because , she apparently was the joke . Just like John Huston , John Carradine , Grady Sutton , Andy Devine and other veteran performers in the film , they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images . They are cast as smarmy self - parodies , as is Rex Reed , the arrogant , fey film critic , who is cast as just that in the film . But the real Reed , the celebrity hound , jet - setting , talk show gossip , can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way ; but as Myron , Myra 's alter ego , he is just obnoxious . Again , apparently for Sarne , Reed is the joke.You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you do n't see actors , you see victims . None more so than Raquel Welch . No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress , but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered . Being in almost every scene , Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film , but to her credit , she gives a remarkably nuanced performance . Though , of course , centered between the scenery chewing Huston and the almost catatonic West , Welch does n't have to do much to strike a good balance . Even so , she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk , with just the hint of self - righteous glee that would do any James Bond villain proud . Legend has it that Welch was snubbed by a condescending West and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director Sarne , not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another , making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance.The film 's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film 's agenda is . The whole story is a fantasy fable , which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver , but what that might be is anybody 's guess . With all of its talk about destroying "" the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race , "" it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind . But as a feminist , Myra is a monstrous figure , a sexual predator . Besides , Myra is n't a woman , rather she is a delusion of Myron , who presumably is a gay male . That might explain the male rape scene as well as the character 's love / hate attitude toward the macho , seemingly straight , deadhead Rusty , but it does n't explain his / her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with Farrah Fawcett 's Mary Ann . The film is obsessed with sex , but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution ; all the sex is treated as being , if not dirty , than at least perverse and degrading . Turning to Gore Vidal 's original novel is n't of any help , because it is as confused and pointless as the movie.And this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies . Not just movies as a business , but movies as part of the culture as well . The film itself is wall - to - wall arcane references to old movies , all of which director - screenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain . He has raided the film vaults of 20th Century - Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films , not as an homage or to provide a social commentary , but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood . How can an artist -- if you generously want to call Sarne that -- make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in ? The very effort is totally self - defeating.MYRA BRECKINRIDGE does n't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty . It hates Hollywood , it hates America , it hates sex , it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and , well , you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it . In a very sad and sorry way , MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto , a celebration of pop culture nihilism ."	0
"I disagree with Anyone who done't like this movie . < br />I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do . It 's sweet , funny and warms your heart . And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed . < br />And even though it did n't have much of a story , it was still excellent I give it a 10 and two thumbs up . < br />Oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish 's and dreams can come true . ( Tear , tear)I love this movie , personally if anyone says it sucked than I will say "" Shame on you . "" Because it was a delightful little movie and I 'm glad that at least SOME people liked it ."	1
"Mary Pickford ( "" Born on the Fourth of July "" as Angela Moore ) is "" The Little American "" ( of French heritage ) ; she falls in love with Jack Holt ( as Karl Von Austreim ) , who had moved to America with his German father and American mother . French - American Raymond Hatton ( as Count Jules de Destin of the "" Fighting Destins "" ) has fallen in love with Ms. Pickford . The love triangled threesome eventually wind up in France , with the Great War ( World War I , in hindsight ) complicating their lives considerably.A mostly entertaining , if propagandistically flawed , Cecil B. DeMille film . The torpedoing , and sinking , of a ship carrying Pickford is "" Titanic""-like . The war intrigue gets dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for France , while the Germans occupy her ancestral home . Of course , German lover Holt arrives . It was difficult to believe they took so long to recognize each other as he moved in for the rape , but it was dark ; and , prior events had them believe each other dead . The film goes WAY over - the - top in its symbolism . Pickford was , by the way , Canadian - though , few could deny she was n't a "" Little American "" , for all intents and purposes.FUN to spot "" extras "" who later became major stars include Wallace Beery , Colleen Moore , and Ramon Novarro - especially , watch for Mr. Novarro exhibiting "" star "" quality during one of the film 's more memorable sequences : Pickford and the wounded soldier saluting each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher . Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write a letter for him ; obviously , he 's got a future in pictures . Also future - bound is Ben Alexander , who plays the boy "" Bobby "" ; he becomes a dependable child actor , and grows up to become a Jack Webb partner on "" Dragnet "" . < br /><br / > * * * * * * * The Little American ( 7/12/17 ) Cecil B.

I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing , as I am , you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck . The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early ( and embarrassing ) footage . It 's as if the producers of Laugh - In sat down and decided to write a full length film , covering all the high points ( and more ) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment , then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $ 10,000 budget to complete it . Hardly a classic , but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was , the silliness , the over - idealism , and the uptightness of the establishment . Clearly not for everyone .	0
Devil Dog sets your heart racing . It 's brilliantly paced , the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being . You 'll never look at your dog the same way again . In fact you 'll start thinking of having it put down - BY A PRIEST ! FANTASTIC !	0
Mendez and Marichal have provided us with a serious , cogent and painful analysis of the social , spiritual , economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism have spawned in Puerto Rico . A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have met and yet because our nation refuses to faces its imperial responsibilities , Puerto Ricans are allowed to wither and die.The spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of Puerto Rico has created , if undermining families , and the basic institutions that sustain any society . Corruption is rampant to the extent that people are not paying taxes ( which has led a fiscal crisis for this nation ) and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeate the island 's culture.Fortunately , a grant allowed this painful yet powerful film to be produced.A must see . . .	1
Boring and appallingly acted(Summer Pheonix ) . She sounded more Asian than Jewish . Some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century . What on earth fine actors like Ian Holm & Anton Lesser were doing in this is beyond me .	0
A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition . But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling ( and not so ) LA actor . It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit . It 's also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell . Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that does n't compromise its production values at any level . The writing is tight , the dialogue first rate . Cassini is an actor 's actor , and the role really shows off his talents . The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic , and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time . I saw it at an advanced screening , and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards .	1
This film is horrible . Bad acting , bad writing , bad music . It 's just horrible . Not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role - playing games , but the key elements of the film are poorly executed . May the God I do n't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination .	0
Mysterious murders in a European village seem the result of THE VAMPIRE BAT horde plaguing the terrified community.This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures , one of Hollywood 's Poverty Row studios . The sparse production values and rough editing actually add to its eerie atmosphere and lend it an almost expressionistic quality . Overall , it leaves the viewer the feeling of being caught up in a bad dream , which is appropriate for a thriller of this sort.Even though the eventual explanation for the hideous crimes is quite ludicrous and is not given proper plot development , the film can boast of a good cast . Grave Lionel Atwill gives another one of his typically fine performances , this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle . Beautiful Fay Wray plays his assistant in a role which requires her to do little more than look lovely & alarmed . Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as the perplexed police inspector who also happens to be , conveniently , Miss Wray 's boyfriend.Maude Eburne , who could be extremely funny given the right situation , steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray 's hypochondriac aunt . Elderly Lionel Belmore plays the village 's terrified burgermeister . And little Dwight Frye , who will always be remembered for his weird roles in the FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula films , here is most effective as a bat - loving lunatic .	1
"Oh , come on people give this film a break . The one thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry , still thinking . Oh yeah ! ! ! ! When John Wayne came and shot up the the bad guys . Oh , sorry , wrong movie , I was thinking of a better quality film . Let me see now , I 'm still trying to defend it . Oh yeah , the chick that was from Clueless was in it . Do n't put down Stacy Dash . I mean , we all make mistakes . But boy , Stacy , you made a dooooosie.Hey , one thing that has never been done in a western , even an all female cast , they actually hung a woman from the gallows . That might be a western first . Even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal , still , you 've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first . Also , I 've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western , although that did n't happen in this movie , I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses#2 , which should be made right after Ed Wood 's Bride Of The Monster # 2 . Maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for . Orginality , especially with an all African woman cast and an oriental cowgirl.Heeey , if the makers of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess , you could have such slang like , "" Hey , do n't you be takin about my homegirls "" and "" talk to the hand , baby , talk to the hand . "" You could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like , "" That gunfight was TOTALLY RAD man , totally . "" You know things like that ."	0
Harvey Keital 's best performance so far the new century . Very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap - shot of pre - Castro Cuba . The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections . It 's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does n't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . Over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema . The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync - sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US . Unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . But if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world . Recommended .	1
Somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance . In reality , sports and romance go together like oil and water . So , to successfully put the two together on screen ... well , that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom . I never thought it could be done . I will be the first to say that in general I do n't like romantic comedies ... but I do like sports and most movies about sports . This movie was a pretty good mix of the two . Being a baseball fan , I could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with Ben Wrightman ( Jimmy Falon ) being a rabid Boston Redsox fan . Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the Babe that plagued the Redsox for 86 years , and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of Redsox fans are . The Farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy . This was a very good movie that could appeal to many .	1
"This 1970 hit film has not aged well , but frankly , it was not that good when it was released . Yet , it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War . The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV , a privileged Harvard hockey player , who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri , an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background . His old - school father naturally disapproves of Jenny , and in a typical act of rebellion , that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie - era , extemporaneous ceremonies . He lands his dream job in New York , but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease . There is a veneer of then - contemporary film - making techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller , but none of that can hide the old - fashioned , cliché - ridden story at its core . The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling . At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach , but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it 's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic façade . John Marley ( two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in "" The Godfather "" ) does better as Jenny 's plainspoken baker father Phil , as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias . The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years . The print quality on the DVD is good , though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller . The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal ( upon whose book this movie is based ) conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew  Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones , who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver 's roommates ."	0
"You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  "" Herbie : Fully Loaded with crap "" and yes it is true . This movie is really dreadful and totally lame.This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen . The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie . I do n't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie , is n't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it ? < br />What I did n't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle . I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining . Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.Final Words : Unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie . What wastage of my money . I feel like cheated.Rating : 3/10 ( Grade : F )"	0
This guy has no idea of cinema . Okay , it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth , and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship . This all is very good , but look carefully : HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB ! The scenes are unbalanced , without proper start and and , with a disordered content and full of emptiness . He has nothing to say about the subject , so he over - licitates with violence , nakedness and gutter language . How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art ? Why do n't they let him succumb in piece ?	0
The video quality is awful . The sound quality is pathetic . The acting is horrific . The dialog is painful . The lighting is dismal . The editing is laughable . I could go on , but it would be pointless . Snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film . This one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin .	0
Beating the bad guys ... Again is the tag line for this movie , it exposes so much truth about it.Home Alone one and two , film classics . Home Alone three and four , a good film if you 're three ! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl , as hard as it tries to be funny , it 's not . Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else . He 's a very bland actor with bland performances , but it 's not entirely his fault , the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions . The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks , and you 'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real . A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day . And to make things worst , a totally different cast , go see if you do n't believe me , but you 'll regret it .	0
"while being one of the "" stars "" of this film does n't necessarily give me sage insight , i do know quite a bit of what was first there ... and what ended up on the screen . i remember seeing the original cut of "" incoming freshman "" and being very pleased . it was funny , sexy , raunchy , all the main requirements of a drive - in film . you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest ... animal house , porky 's , etc ... so in its own way , this flick was truly ahead of its time . for whatever reasons , the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film , and then edited in ( should i say "" shuffled ? "" ) THE most random scenes ever . the fat guy , the people with goat heads .... what the heck was all that ? ! i 'm sure it was put in for additional T&A , but it was so slowly paced , it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt . but all in all , it 's a fun memory for me ... especially in that i 'm able to say that the worst movie i 've ever seen ... i'm in !"	0
Okay , so I get it . We 're supposed to be horrified . The idea has been planted . A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it . Call me over the shock - rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this . But do n't expect me to watch a soft - porn and become horrified that she is ' doing her father' ... I mean has n't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with ' rape , and molestation ' porn ... Horror is n't what your mind can fool you into believing . It is what actually exists in film . This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure .	0
The only time I have seen this movie was when I was 10 years old . I have remembered it all of these years as I could n't sleep for a week or more after seeing it . It just absolutely rattled me . I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft . Worth , Texas and I will never forget it . Now , 48 years later , my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult . It has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it . I very much enjoyed it , but it gave me quite a scare ! Jaqui	1
This movie was extremely boring . It should least not more than 15 minutes . The images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.Usually I do n't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments . I think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.What more can I say ? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times . It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period . I think it is the point itself.There is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.When you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again .	0
"One word : suPURRRRb ! I do n't think I have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television . Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring re - runs . < br />I have to say I had my reservations . After all , critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show . But when half an hour was over ( by the way , thank you , NBC , for running a commercial - free show ) , I was left with the feeling of instant love , love at first glance , the true love that one feels in his guts . Everything about this show screamed EXCELLENCE.Graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek . No small feat considering those movies took years to be developed.Cast was marvelous . I am partial to John Goodman 's voice , but the rest of the team certainly were on par with John . Special mention : Lisa Kudrow 's guest appearance . She was on top of the game creating neurotic , pudgy , and lovable panda with a Jewish streak in her . ( Panda from Brooklyn ? Only in this show . ) < br />Script was funny , with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp , yet not tacky . A note for all parents : this is NOT for children . This show was never advertised as such , and there 's a reason why it 's set for 9PM , not 8PM . So if you 'd like to complain about "" objectionable context "" , save your breath . Adults deserve a comedy made just for them , and Father of the Pride is it . < br />Not everything was perfect . I was a bit puzzled by Siegfried and Roy 's characters . Do I sense "" stereotype "" when it comes to them ? Yes , they are gay . Yes , they are flamboyant . Yes , they speak with German accents . But that 's yesterday 's news . Give us something new , something fresh , something funny . Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach . I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "" star power "" that these guys have . That 's fine by me . But please do n't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart . Hopefully , the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over . < br />In general , the show is definitely a Must - See - TV . Funny , witty , with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there have n't been a comedy this good since Seinfeld . I am certainly looking forward to the next episode ."	1
I saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on DVD . Recently , I watched several of the reality series on PBS about ranching , etc . None of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does . Based on REAL reality , pulling no punches , bleak , happy , tragic and enlightening , this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life . Fine acting on the part of both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell add to an well done script . The opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the National Endowment for the Humanities . If this is the kind of product taxes could go to I would be happy to see more . I highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film .	1
"It 's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that ca n't be figured out at every turn . Surprises throughout delighting throughout.A couple of things I could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays "" the good girl , hard worker "" and yet in the end she ends up being an anti - social risk taker . That was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause.The other thing I could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film . I never did get who he was or what his issues were . If anyone has any ideas , I 'd like to hear what they might be.The film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing . Very much worth seeing ."	1
Ah WINTER KILLS , based on the novel by Richard Condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago . I knew Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller < br />WINTER KILLS left me cold . It 's not a thriller - It 's a piece of worthless crap , possibly the worst movie I 've seen this month and boy have I seen a lot of bad movies in June . The problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as William Richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce < br />There 's two things wrong with this movie . First off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner . It 's not as OTT as say something like that James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances . This might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there 's none . As a satire it 's very silly , so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable . Secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they 're rendered senseless . Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson . Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane . The scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason < br />A dire movie that 's an ordeal to sit through	0
"When you have a disembodied skull , an empty mansion , a schizophrenic wife , a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener , throw in a minister and his wife - what have you got?AIP 's answer to insomnia.""The Screaming Skull "" gets points for audacity , offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film . Pretty safe bet , when you 're lulled into a stupor by people who think they 're in a production of "" Suspense for Dummies"".But Peggy Webber was a cutie , anyway . She had a few good moments of acting here and there ( especially when trying to communicate with the gardener ) and no one else fills a nightgown like she .

"I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film . BAD plot , bad science , bad acting and overall a bad film . Please do n't watch this film . Rent the original "" War Games "" if you are feeling nostalgic.I did n't like the bending of the plot to beat - the - terrorist - threat idea either . In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat . Politics aside , one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end . No such insight is offered in this film ."	0

Honestly , who in God 's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating ? ? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted . Otherwise this movie sucks ! This movie is nothing more than an amateur , or possibly student , film . I 'm a movie fanatic , and have seen terrible movies , but there was literally nothing redeeming here . The story and acting was the worst I 've ever seen . The props , including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects , where just as bad as everything else . I 'm all for bad language in movies , but the F - Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F - Bomb in any movie EVER . The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film . I 'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country , but it does n't belong on a DVD.Do not buy this movie . Do not rent this movie . All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon . This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back . Unfortunately for me , that time is lost , but it 's not too late for you . If you decide to rent this movie , consider this my warning .	0
Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film . It 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance . It is a simple movie told very well . The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you have n't seen this movie yet , you must check it out . The cast is all terrific . I wish they had never made sequel after sequel . The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel . It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie . She has n't seemed to age ( she 's just as gorgeous today , without the hairdo and seventies clothes ) . The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever !	1
"Seriously , I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood , gore and repulsiveness , but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women . He , John Cassavetes of "" Rosemary 's Baby "" , talks about ruptured uterus , dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish ( ? ) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine . That being said , "" Incubus "" is an ultimately STRANGE horror effort . It is n't necessarily awful  although it is n't very good , neither  but just plain weird . The muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist - killer of flesh and blood ( even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature ) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters . None of these characters , especially not the main ones , come across as sympathetic and for some never - explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets . The aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter - love and continuously behaves like he 's a suspect himself , the town 's sheriff ( John Ireland ) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and does n't even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district , the female reporter is even too weird for words and the Galens ( an old witch and her grandson ) are just plain spooky . All together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns ' women reproducing organs . The sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling . Basically these are very positive factors in a horror film , but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for "" Incubus "" to be a really good film . Also , there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through ( like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert ! ) and the usually very reliable John Hough 's direction is nearly unnoticeable . The final shot is effectively nightmarish , though . For me personally , "" Incubus "" was a bit of a disappointment , but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80 's horror to open - minded genre fanatics ."	0
"This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film . Dolph Friggin ' Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough , but add really corny buddy - buddy action to the mix , an eccentric and over - the - top villain , a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time , and you 've got yourself quite the little suicide - inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and , up till watching "" Showdown , "" had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.I do n't know if it 's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle . There are constant references to male genitalia , and not by females , either . Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other 's manly parts , and in fact before going on a suicide spree , Brandon says to Dolphy , "" In case we do n't make it , I want to tell you , you have the biggest d--- I 've ever seen . ""Now , is this what a normal man would say to another man ? In an ACTION film no less ? And would you want those to be your _ dying words_??Later , there 's this gem:Dolph ( regarding the villain ) : "" I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy . "" Brandon : "" Man , you 've got a fixation . "" < br />As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out , "" Unfortunately , Dolph does n't respond with , ' I 've got a fixation ? I 've got a fixation ? ! You 're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates ! I was just gon na chop of his ears and his nose , man .

"Good times working with the Quiroz Brothers , and the entire cast on this project as the "" Guy on the Bench . "" I was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true "" B "" horror film . Hopefully I will have the opportunity to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future . I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release . One time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind . It was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as I signed her receipt . One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster if the movie is rented often , and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer . At the time it was renting more than Ring2 which was also a new release at the time ... The title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets . She also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people do n't want to give it back .... Watch out for ZoMbIeS when in the hood cause they will get ya ! Jaysun Barr ( Guy on the Bench-2005 )"	1
"This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol . Oh sorry , it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003 , how funny.This is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past . Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damned good , Göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the "" Führer "" always seems to look like 56 . And the buildings , folks , even buildings have been young , sometimes . Especially 1919 were a lot of houses in Germany nearly new ( the WWI does not reach German cities ! ) . No crumbling plaster ! Then the Reichstagsbuilding . There have never been urban canyons around this building , never . And this may sound to you all like a miracle : in the year 1933 the Greater Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines , some even with turntable ladders , but none with a hand pump.One last thing : What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence ? For me this was a kind of "" Adolf 's Adventures in Wonderland """	0
Rated NR(would be Rated R for Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor ) . Quebec Rating:16+(should be 13 + ) Canadian Home Video Rating:18A < br />Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie 's first stand up comedy routine . This came out in 1983.Back then he starred in the movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live . Eddie made two stand up comedy films . Delirious and Raw . I preferred Raw because I just found the subject matter to be more humorous . Delirious however is also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as Mr . T and singers such as Michael Jackson . Any fan of stand - up comedy films should see Eddie Murphy 's Delirious .	1
The summary pretty much sums it all up . This is nowhere near as good as the original . With a script co - written by both Stallone and James Cameron ( at the same time he was also writing Aliens ) . Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids , depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon . He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex - forces to placate Rambo.The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam . Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself . He is told it 's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit , meets his contact ( who turns out to be a cute woman ) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one . As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick - up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board.Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter . It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz . Killing many of them , Rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroys the Ops Centre.A weak plot and very weak ending as Rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man .	0
I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience . The imagination on display , the visual interpretation of the script , the humor is constantly surprising . The two leads are great and really carry the film . My advice would be to not even watch a trailer , just rent the film and watch without expectations . I rented from blockbuster , so it is readily available in brisbane , not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that 's always good , unless it 's just ' that was stupid ' . I loved this film , you just do n't get to see gem 's like this every day . This should become a cult favorite . Give it a try , you may just feel the same way about it as i do .	1
"Fans of the HBO series "" Tales From the Crypt "" are going to love this MOH episode . Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on , will recognize this one right off the bat.Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan ( also an excellent writer - co - author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER ) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way . He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy - next - door , or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness . In the case of RIGHT TO DIE , he takes the latter approach , and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist ( Robin Sydney ) , much to the displeasure of his inconsolable , unforgiving spouse , Abbey ( Julia Anderson ) . When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of "" making up , "" and she 's horribly burned in a fire , he 's reluctant to pull the plug on her , not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy ( Corbin Bernsen , looking the worse for wear these days . ) < br />But Abbey 's never been one to give up without a fight , and that 's where the EC - theme of the episode comes in . Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre 's favorite subject matter for some spooky ( and OOKY ) supernatural shenanigans , and this case is definitely no exception . If anything , the ramped - up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And that 's not to mention that John Esposito 's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist . You do n't realize as you 're watching that you only know half the story , until close to the end ... (think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas , and you 're there.)Not a bad effort , but not the best of the lot , either . At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction , especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed ! As with most MOH episodes , this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment , so the extremely squeamish need not apply ."	1
"It 's been close to ten years since I 've seen either of the last two sequels to "" Phantasm "" - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good . That being acknowledged to this day , I 'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought I 'd go back and re - experience the ' final chapters ' . Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that does n't make much sense ... Again , kicking off right where the previous movie left us , Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later , but things are n't safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere . Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister double - pronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him ... Along the way , he meets up with a ten year - old kid and a nun - chuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey.There 's really nothing memorable about "" Phantasm III "" other than how stupid and forcefully "" humorous "" it tries to be . Only one positive aspect that did n't even help the movie and that was the return of A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic . The problem is , they pretty much make cameo appearances ... Reggie Banister is of course back in his starring role , but his bumbling , love - sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like . Angus Scrimm also just did n't seem entirely "" into "" his role . He talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the "" quirkiness "" that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to . Most people 's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think "" it 's still entertaining "" . Maybe I 'm just too much of a nit picker but I just could n't get into this one . I remember disliking it when I was a kid and after re - watching it - I can safely say - nothing has changed . Don Coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low - budget , nightmarish , legendary film "" Phantasm "" , which I still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and GORY , but "" Lord of the Dead "" ( stupid title ) just looked too rushed and slapped together to me ... The inclusion of the two new characters , Tim and Rocky ( the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo ! ! ) , was a strong indication of Coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise ... So , it 's a "" Phantasm "" movie with very little gore , nudity , and quadruple - barrel shot guns . Need I say more ?"	0
Even 20 + years later , Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit through . Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene , fire their obnoxiously noisy sub - machine guns with wild abandon , and then silently leave . Wow , how will we find those silent invisible assassins ? Just follow the shell casings and smoke!Painfully bad dialog ( or was it brilliant and just poorly translated ? ) , not an Asian in sight in the cast , and a whopping total of 3 Asians among the stunt crew . The plot is ridiculous , the acting pretty much non - existent - then again , ninja ca n't act ! Save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs !	0
This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized . There are two routes to take in horror films : either you do n't really explain what 's going on ( or who the killer is , like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained ( Halloween could potentially be an example of this).Unfortunately , Creep fails in this area . I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation . No character is fully realized , although the circular nature of Kate 's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.In the end , this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film - making that drag down the film.This film will go down as another example of a film ( as most are ) that could be so much better even though it would never be great . The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting : the characters , story , direction , and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless , silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment , but sadly , that 's about it ...	0
"I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres . "" October Sky "" feels and looks oh so familiar . And it is . All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better . But despite it 's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood , this movie is winning and likeable at every turn . < br />Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart , mind and soul . Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim 's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation ( "" What do you call it ? You call it a miracle . "" ) , Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale . While jaded townsfolk of their 1950 's coal town dismiss the event , Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new . Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer 's ailing young school teacher . Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship . Also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film . Perfectly played all around . Even Homer 's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion . Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking . "" Myrtle Beach "" says it all . < br />A major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you 'll love this film or they 'll refund your money . For once , I agree with them . You 'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.<br / >"	1
Stewart Kane ( Gabriel Byrne , VANITY FAIR ) heads out with his local Jindabyne , Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest , recreation , and relaxation . But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman 's body floating face - down in a river , things appear to have turned out for the worst . The largest casualty of the weekend is the men 's commonsense . They do n't hike out of the ravine , and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches . Then they head out and report the body.The town and the men 's lives quickly turn into a mess . The local media swarms them , and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives . Stewart 's wife Claire ( Laura Linney , THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE ) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did , but has to battle with it through her own mental illness.Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle , splayed out on a morgue slab . Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne : a division of men and women , black and white , social and outcast.The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids : Stewart and Claire 's son who is being led around by a half - breed Aussie who 's mother was killed also just a few years before . The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can , and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this ( again , the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised).Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface , yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around ( the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface ) . None , that is , until Claire forces them to.The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted . There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just does n't get done ; too many loose threads . The acting was okay , but the filming was terrible . Wobbly cameras , grainy or dark shots , and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.I enjoy symbolic films , NORTHFORK being one of my all - time favorites in that vein . But Jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems , which simply did n't happen .	0

Obviously , there was n't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other ( great ) Chinese films . I first saw this when I was 14 years old , I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ...	1
As someone who has never condescended Adam Sandler in terms of talent , as is done to him and many comic actors like him , I walked in to Reign Over Me expecting a great film , not simply because of his presence in the movie but because I thought that it looked very good overall . Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that I was surprised at how fantastic he is in it . He will make you weep , especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue . What 's amazing about his role is that it 's a character it 's hard to say we 've seen before . We 've seen many emotionally scarred characters , many mentally retarded people , many loners , many passionate self - centered artists , but Sandler 's Charlie Fineman is none of these . He may have a taste of each of them in some ways , but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual . It 's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems , mindset , and provocations are completely different from most characters like him.Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level . He is every man . He is the most normal possible person in the world , so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either , or at least any that are played the way he plays Alan Johnson , whose name is even found on the assembly line . Cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny , jolting , smart , and stupid the way so many normal people are.The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who 've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles . Jada Pinkett - Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife , Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge , Robert Klein is Sandler 's desensitized father - in - law.Mike Binder 's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises . It 's much more subtle than , say , Babel , and has a much more close - to - home ideal.The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style . This film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen - sink style of the 1970s . Cinematography was grainy and unfastened , but that was its charm . It was n't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would 've diluted its stories with such.The music , which plays a major role in the film , and its title , is very powerful . Near the beginning , you feel like you 're in for another About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine sort of soundtrack , but you soon realize you 're in for more than that . In fact , the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes.Reign Over Me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself . It goes to show that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders .	1
"The movie is boring , the characters and scenarios are unrealistic , unbelievable , the action is hilarious . This movie is a big mess . It almost seems like when the action music kicks in , the most impressive stunt is running . Either voice is dubbed over with Mr. McGregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice . There is way too much dialog in this movie , and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf . The movie is great sleep therapy . The fighting is laughable . The eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent . The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed . The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation , he would just throw random plots in such as ( spoiler ) "" CTX ( his designer drug)is going to be in the water supply "" which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie . This movie is highly recommended to pass ."	0
This is a great Canadian comedy series . The movie tells of how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay-(Julian ) and the head writer of the show and his buddies Rickie and Bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of said trashy hoods . The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian begin doing their more advanced forays into the world of crime . WHY and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so I shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades . Their friend and oft - time partner(Bubbles ) is a brilliant character . The whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit - com one bit . It is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams . If you ever have the opportunity to watch -- buy -- steal this program grab it . You will be glad you did . And to my American friends --- It will break you up also . 10 out of 9 . Brilliant . TV how TV should be .	1
The Brothers Quay are directors , judging by conventional thought , should have stuck to making short films . I myself actually really liked their first feature , Institute Benjamenta , but judging by their sophomore effort , The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes , I 'm willing to agree they do n't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length . Piano Tuner is , without a doubt , a gorgeous film to look at , and often to listen to . Unfortunately , it 's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace . Reading the plot synopsis , it sounds like a pretty good story . But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life . One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future : dialogue . My God , it 's awful here . A huge bust .	0
If you love kung - fu films and you have n't seen this movie , you are cheating yourself . This movie is one of the only kung - fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film . Normally , it takes a die - hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films , but this one has it all ! The story is well told , and complete . The fight scenes are great , and tend to end before you 're completely bored with them ( unlike Crouching Tiger ) . Throw in a little mystery and torture and you 've got yourself one heck of a movie . See this one at all costs . Heck , my wife even enjoyed it.Wu Du it!9 out of 10 < br /><br / >	1
"The people who are bad - mouthing this film are those who do n't understand film to begin with . These are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that does n't star Leonardo DiCaprio . Wilder Napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first , but what it lacks in plot , it more than makes up for in substance.One thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it 's use of music , which plays a large part . Those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie , both in Vida and Wilder 's life , and in the background . Wilder 's theme , Vida 's theme , and Wallace 's theme are all heard in the opening sequence , and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out . For instance , in the scene where the men are singing "" Duke of Earl "" , Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "" She is my girl "" , and then she goes over to Wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric "" She will be my girl "" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie , and while it may look like a flop on the outside , the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is ."	1
I have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget . Bad acting , horrible cinematography , and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie . The WWF style cinemtography will make you cry ... where 's the tripod ? ! The filmakers aimed high , but sorely missed their mark .	0
I went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b - rated movie . I came out surprised and very amused . Eva was good , but Lake Bell stole the show . She had amazing comedic timing . The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . The plot was enough to tie it all together , a woman ( Eva ) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was - to - be husband , its sounds far - fetched but it actually works quite well . < br />7/10 - Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch , if not get it on DVD when it comes out .	1
Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs , but with clever dollop of suspense . Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken - down bus on its way to nowhere , but which passenger is it , ( talk about your illegal immigrants ! ) . All - star supporting cast , from wild - eyed Jack Elam ( hamming it up shamelessly ) , to sexy Jean Willes ( if she 's the Martian , then I say let 's open the borders ! ) , to cruel - faced John Hoyt ( the most obvious suspect ) , along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips ( and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver ) . Makes for a very entertaining half - hour even if the action is confined to a single set .	1

"Spoilers I guess.<br / > The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie . I just could n't get over it . And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg 's character ?

"" But he 's all like , "" talking apes , okay . Next ? "" That 's pretty jaded I 'd say . He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis . Besides that , this is Rick Baker 's best work yet . This film is a true testament to how far we 've come in the monkey makeup field . 3/10 ."	0
A critical and financial flop when first release , the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the Director 's best . A La Ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ( Ben Gazzara , John Ritter and Blaine Novak ) persue , fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film ( Audrey Hepburn , Colleen Camp , Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen ) . Much of the script was ad - libbed or re - written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel . Ben Gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing Audrey Hepburn after dropping singer Colleen Camp and seeing cab - driver Patti Hansen on the side . John Ritter ineptly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her . Blaine Novak has a few girls he is chasing ( including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena ) . This film has some great performances by a supurb cast . Standouts are Audrey Hepburn ( she does n't have a line in the first half of the film ) . Ben Gazzara has never been better ( and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead ) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer Christy Miller . She is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat - a - tat - tat delivery . Highly Recommended ! * * * * * * * * * stars !	1
"This movie 's heart was in the right place , no matter where its brain was.""Attack "" is basically a spoof a la "" Airplane !

Of course there 's a meddling reporter ( Taylor ) who pops in at the worst times , dancing and singing Army soldiers , Japanese scientists with dubbed - in voices , some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yeah , the San Diego Chicken before he made it big.The gags here are n't all that great . In fact , you could probably make up better yourself after watching these . Some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ( "" Please pass the ketchup "" - not something to say in front of tomatoes . ) and as far as "" Puberty Love "" goes ... well , I ca n't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.What 's good about it ? Well , I liked the theme song and the beginning credits , and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed . ... that 's about it.Three stars .

This is n't art , it 's inner - urban , politically - correct propaganda ! Jindabyne 's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable ... it does n't see people as individuals , but rather , as members of categories.This is the most patronisingly offensive Australian movie I can recall ever ( and it 's up against some pretty stiff competition ! ) . A message movie , every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there : Aborigines are victims ; white men are violent or alcoholics ; white women are n't that bad -particularly if they are lesbians - but they 're most likely of a depressive nature.Four men who go away fishing , find the body of a murdered woman ( Aboriginal , naturally ) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout . It 's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion , as if the men are animals . The one man who briefly demurs is the goodie ... we know this because he 's living with a bisexual woman - he likes to hold his baby a lot - and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location ( away from all these beastly bush - dwellers).This is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within . It 's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt . The film is shot through with long - distance views of the bush backed by foreboding , mysterious music . It 's made very clear by the end that Aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape . It concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black - white reconciliation.In Jindabyne , country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other Australians.This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the Government 's Film Finance Corporation . It 's a product of the artsy set , that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects ( which are as detached from real life as possible ) , as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see . It does n't matter if the film is a stinker , they still get paid.Spare yourself from wasting time , avoid it like the plague . More jaded social commentary than actual entertainment , this film deserves to pan !	0
Allen and Julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night . No one knows who killed the little girl but it 's why they moved to the mountains . So the couple moves into this cabin and it 's haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it.This movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump . Some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part I did n't expect . It was a pretty good movie that was n't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good.I also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends . It is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie .	1
This movie was the best movie I have ever seen . Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith . Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone . I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart . This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with . After I saw this movie , there was not a single dry eye in the entire room . Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it . I highly recommend this movie for everyone .	1
This has got to be the best movie I 've ever seen.Combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot , and you have a masterpiece.Dog Bite Dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes , recoiling in horror during others , and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending.The film left a deep impression on me . It 's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender ' love ' scenes . The film is undeserving of it 's Cat III ( nudity ) rating ; there are no nude scenes whatsoever , and the ' love ' scenes do not even involve kissing or ' making out'.The message which this film presented to me ? All human beings , no matter how violent or cruel they may seem , have a tender side . Edison Chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous Pang.I rate this film 10/10 . It 's a must - watch .	1
""" Home Room "" came as a total surprise . Not having a clue as to what it was all about , it paid off big time because it does n't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates , who are the innocent victims of his rash actions.Paul Ryan , the director , who is working and editing his own material , is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school . She has been away a couple of years and does n't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students . For one , she is a rebel with a punk look , lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit . Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died , supposedly killed by her boyfriend . Alicia , we realize , is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life , but we are not given any clues to that effect.What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy , as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it . Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who should n't have been at the school , at all . When a ricochet bullet hit her , she is hospitalized with more than a wound . She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares do n't let her forget.Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal . Since she does n't cooperate with the police , the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows . Alicia dislikes Deanna , but in a matter of days , both girls will make peace . We do n't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school.Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is equally good as Deanna . Victor Garber , James Pinkins , Taylor Holland , and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble.The film has an intensity because it 's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred , which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie ."	1
"Rented it last night . The opening(2001 ) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long . The hitchiker scene served no purpose . Some skits were just retarded . I knew beforehand , Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes . No problem . Here are the best parts:KOKO , URANUS , BABS COMMERCIAL , Curtis Mayfield song < br />Total : 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie < br />Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.Let me give you some advice : If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies , rent "" Kentucky Fried Movie "" . If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies , rent "" AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON "" or "" UHF""Otherwise , do n't bother renting this movie . You 'll save 2 - 3 dollars.IMHO : Ken Shapiro 's best movie is STILL "" Modern Problems """	0
Wow , the plot for this film is all over the place ! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin ! ! And , as a result , none of it seemed particularly believable.The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town . She 's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway . When a big - time actor arrives in town , she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost . But , her husband is worried about shenanigans -- as this actor is a cad . So , the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor -- and the actor dies ! As a result , he 's convicted of First Degree Murder ! ! ! Not Manslaughter , but Murder 1 ! Now , pregnant and in need of funds , Kay goes to New York . But Broadway jobs are n't to be found , so she 's forced to take any job -- even Burlesque . Unable to adequately care for her young daughter , she gives it to another woman to raise . However , eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy . But , the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play . Despondent , she makes her way to England and becomes a real star . Years later , she returns to New York to get her kid -- but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother . At the same time , her husband 's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $ 10,000 he can get the man out of prison . As another reviewer wrote , is this to bribe people ? ! How can $ 10,000 get him out otherwise -- maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up ! ! Wow -- this is enough for 2 or 3 films ! And , all this occurs by the 45 minute mark ! ! ! Believe it or not , there 's quite a bit more to it . If you really care , see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.This is sort of like ' kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping , somehow , it will all work . Unfortunately , the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms. Francis ' best efforts . It 's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd - rate plot . It 's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements , threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie ! ! Overall , unless you are a die - hard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s , this one is one you can easily skip . Not terrible but certainly not good.By the way , the child who plays Francis ' daughter upon her return to New York ( Sybil Jason ) really was terrible . I think she was supposed to be ... I think .	0
"The legend of Andrei Konchalovsky 's towering 4 and a half hour poem to Siberia is not to begin at once , because it must hold back for space , because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half - remembered childhood memories in a turn - of - the - century backwoods village , yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the Soviet working spirit . Konchalovsky celebrates Soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like Soy Cuba and Invincible the mood turns somber and reflective . News of the revolution reach the secluded Siberian village through the grapevine . The fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist . Through all this , Konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual , with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back , waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancé 's father with an axe , the irreverent folly of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late , came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland , the despair and resignation of the middle - aged Regional Party Leader who comes back to his small Siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant . The movie segues from decade to decade from the 10 's to the 80 's with amazing newsreel footage trailing Soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire ( terrific visuals here ! all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces ) but the actual movie focuses on the individual , on triumphs and follies small and big . By the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in ; of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning . "" It ca n't matter "" , seems like the world is saying , to which Konchalovksy answers "" it must matter "" because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.Yet behind this saga of ' man against landscape ' something seems to hover , shadowy , almost substanceless , like the Eternal Old Man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists , sometimes a mere spectactor , sometimes the enigmatic sage ; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters , something invisible seems to lurk . Ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams , repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky , a curious bear , indeed the Eternal Old Man himself ; Konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order . In its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them , often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time , and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism , it reminds me of Shohei Imamura 's The Profound Desires of the Gods . When , in a dream scene , Alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of Stalin to reach out at his ( dead ) father as he vanishes in the fog , the movie hints at the betrayal of the Soviet Dream , or better yet , at all the things lost in the revolution , this betrayal made more explicit in the film 's fiery denouement . The amazing visuals , elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge , help seal the deal . By the end of it , an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema ."	1
""" Black Angel "" is minor whodunit , with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance . Dan Duryea ( the husband of the murdered woman ) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit . Peter Lorre has one thankless role as a suspect . This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer , never achieving anything special . It is pleasant enough but then , at some point , it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big "" give me a break "" reactions . That ending alone could have sank the film completely , but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either . Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good guys . I love film noirs , but this one was a real disappointment ."	0
Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production . I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made . Everyone involved is perfect ; script , acting , direction , sets and editing . Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance , and the supporting cast are magnificent , it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was . Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve . Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best . Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking .	1
... but I enjoyed this show anyway . I 've been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show , and I 'm having a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism in my own head ( except one : that the show was stale ; this program was ANYTHING but stale ) . A lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money : pretentious ; forced ; overwrought ; desperate for attention ; self - satisfied ; annoying ever - present narration . But you know what ? I really liked it . It was different , it was original , it really , really TRIED ; and that made up for all the minuses . The show was bright , verbal , quick , witty , interesting , fun to look at ... you know , it was only on once a week , I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it . I will mourn its passing . But I guess nobody will be bringing this back to life .	1
It has a great name , but that s it and you wo nt get more than that for your money , in fact the first 30 - 40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just ca nt understand what s happening until the action its gone.And yet the producers ( Roberto Angel Salcedo ) calls him an actor , but i do n't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting!! .... period . The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing.For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it , but they did n't ! ! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad , i do n't buy it.But hopefully this is as bad as it gets . To make people accept those DVD 's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it , that might work out.Maka	0
"An ultra - nervous old man , "" Mr. Goodrich , "" terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing , really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it , saying "" You will be next ! "" < br />He calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier . Of course , it 's the Stooges , who could n't respond because had come into the office , robbed them and tied them up . Some detectives ! The moment poor Mr. Goodrich hangs up the phone and says , "" I feel safer already , "" a monster - type goon named "" Nico "" appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious . We next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that . Now these crooks have to deal with the "" detectives "" that are coming by the house for Mr. Goodrich.Some of the gags , like Moe and Larry 's wrinkles , are getting a bit old , but some of them will provoke laughs if I see them 100 times . I always laugh at Shemp trying to be a flirt , as he does here with Mr. Goodrich 's niece , in a classic routine with a long , accordion - like camera lens . The act he puts on when he 's poisoned is always funny , too . Shemp was so good that I did n't mind he was taking the great Curly 's place.Larry , Moe , Curly / Shemp were always great in the chase scenes , in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house . That 's the last six minutes in here . At times , such as this film ,"	1
"A young woman who is a successful model , and is also engaged to be married , and who has twice attempted suicide in the past , is chosen by a secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "" sentinel "" to the gateway to Hell , which apparently goes through a creepy old , but well maintained Brooklyn apartment building . Its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves , but apparently ca n't escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way . The previous one(John Carradine ) is about dead , so she , by fate or whatever , becomes the next one , and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free . Lots of interesting details lie under the surface , her relationship with her father , the stories of the doomed , her fiancé , so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror , but given the sets , the great cast , and overall level of bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing ."	1
"This film was n't programmed in Italian cinemas , I have seen it at a manifestation called "" fantafestival"" . I find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark , the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there 's no suspence in the film . Music is completely out of the story and I do n't have words to describe the visual effects . If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting , but a few minutes later it becomes busy . The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review ."	0
"All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios ' last productions , here comes something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all , A Bug 's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake "" hand - made - old - Disneys - like "" drawings ( see the Lion King , Pocahontas , and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi 's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).A bug 's life ( 1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks ! ) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say "" Hey , this thing is computer generated ! "" . No weak parts , a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets , an astonishing 3D bird ( close to perfection in its imitation of reality ) ... and that 's only to mention the technical aspects.The scenario , my friends , the real backbone of a motion picture , has some thickness ! Curiously , and obviously thanks to Lasseter 's team , there is practically no musical sequence in A bug 's life . Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate , but most others dislike ( same thing for the parents or the anime fans , like me ) . This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story ( a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen ( who finally turn to be actors ) to protect them , etc ... ) . Simple , but efficient , and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.Since Microcosmos , many movies tell tales of insects , their lives , fears and hopes , but I do think that A bug 's life is the funniest and best directed of all . The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved ... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik 's ( aka Tilt in France ) adventures.A big thank you for Lasseter 's team , especially for the last 30 seconds ... it 's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs / actors forget their lines or hit the camera ... And finally , especially for those of you who have seen the french version , other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie . A bug 's life is a really good piece of entertainment , and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos ( a privilege granted to extremely few movies , and that 's not a problem of storage room :) . Go and see it , that 's an order ."	1
I love this movie . It was one of my favorite movies . The action never stops . The whole movie was done very well . The ending is really good . Ontop of it being action filled , they even have a surprised put in there for you . When i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie , but sense i am such a big Luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance . I am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie . It was very original . Whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me . The acting was great . Luke Perry did an excellent job once again . I give this movie the highest rating .	1
I do n't know the stars , or modern Chinese teenage music - but I do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one.Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values - it 's played for laughs , for love , and is a great blend of Kung Fu and basketball.Everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this - the production values are excellent - and modern China looks glossier than Los Angeles here.The plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play ( and love and more etc ; ) is great - this is fresh , fun , and immensely entertaining.With great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we 're seen in a long time.Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - a GOOD sports comedy movie .	1
Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio , I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso . < br />But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract . No one else could have done it , I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it . I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen . For his tenor voice was his life , his reason for being on the earth . < br />To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest . Caruso , like the man who portrayed him , was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline . He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film . < br />His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought . He 's shown in a recording studio once late in his life . Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live . But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men . It 's why both became the legends that they are.What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza , a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera . The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso . Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could n't get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth , Dorothy Kirsten , and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film , Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you 're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso , this ai n't it . If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career , than you should not miss The Great Caruso .	1
I had never seen a silent movie until July 24 , 2005 . I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it . I 've seen thousands of movies . Very few are hypnotic to me . I found Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable ( Ray Liotta ) to be hypnotic , so consider the source as you read this . I started watching Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was , who has been credited by many for launching Hollywood . I had no idea what I was in for . Two hours later , I snapped out of it , and realized I 'd watched one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen , playing a role perfectly suited to her . Imagine a movie fan in 1922 , having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before . You would have to see her again and again . The setting was perfect for a girl that expressive . She was a poor squatter , could n't speak the King 's English , but you had to admire her . What a movie ... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection !	1
"I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today . It 's the second time in two days and yes , I do see movies I like as many times as is necessary . Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and Goldsworthy 's works . This morning when I threw the coins I received # 29 The Abysmal ( Water ) . Goldsworthy has an affinity with water , hence the title . I received the 5th line changing which moved to # 7 The Army . To Blake Art was a War . Anyway , I knew I had to see the film again.I read one of the few reviews extant Online from the SF Examiner . The critic loved the film but said Goldsworthy 's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film . He 'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack . So I was aware of that as I watched this second time.Yesterday I thought that I 'd vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World . Well today I could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say . Could I enjoy the film without his comments ? What he is doing , what he is saying goes way beyond "" art "" . His understanding of Water , Time , Stone , Change , and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar . Some of his work / words are Zen like . His knowledge ... Anyway , the film is only ( apparently ) being shown here in the Bay Area . Be a Trend setter . Go to your local cinema and tell them , no insist that they have to book a film you 've heard about from the hinter lands . It 's called Rivers and Tides.<br / >"	1
"It is wonderful to watch Roshan Seth ( the strict father in 1992 "" Mississippi Masala "" ) , who once again takes on the role of a father and head of the family , and more , in SUCH A LONG JOURNEY , set in 1971 Bombay , India . Besides the closely knit family settings , subject matters include the lost and found of a friendship ; the unexpected death of a friend ( somehow the calm smiling face of a friend in death in the presence of prayers felt peaceful - so Gustad Noble , Roshan 's character , similarly noted ) ; a sidewalk artist 's chain of events - "" the wall as a latrine turned into a shrine  shrine into rumbles and ashes "" was at once prophetic and philosophical . It 's packed full of life lessons in different aspects of varying relationships : between father and son ; mother and son ; father and little daughter ; little daughter and father and mother ; longtime colleagues ; long lost dear friends ; even that of a man to man , one whose an innocent slow - witted "" fool"".In spite of the tone of the film 's era , it 's a colorful film rich in substance , and the strength of the story in textural layers with humor and suspense . For a director who is not Indian ( Sturla Gunnarsson being Icelandic ) , he 's made a political Indian / Pakistani film . He gets into the bone marrow of the life of this Parsi portrayed by Roshan Seth , whose performance has such nuances , subtlety , and joy . ( There is singing , too . ) The rest of the cast is equally strong : from Om Puri the mysterious friend of a friend ; Soni Razdan the enduring wife ; Vrajesh Hirjee the argumentative eldest son ; Sam Dastor the longtime office mate ; Ranjit Chowdhry the pavement artist ; to a superstitious "" witch "" woman of a neighbor ; an unbeguiling "" fool "" of a man ; and a long lost bosom friend - it 's a world of many faces and perspectives . Director Gunnarsson has demonstrated sensitivity in the treatment of that time period and subject was well researched with attention to details . He has the good fortune to have Sooni Taraporevala ( 1992 "" Mississippi Masala "" , 1988 "" Salaam Bombay ! "" ) wrote the script . This is truly a worthwhile journey of a film to partake.Along the lines of cultural exploration ( road movie style ) , Fridrik Thor Fridriksson 1994 "" Cold Fever "" is an Icelandic sojourn about a Japanese young man who went across the globe in search of the specific spot to pay his last respects to his parents , dutifully following memorial rituals for the dead . Such demonstrated reverence and cross - cultural attention to family ties are heart - warming in this day and cyber age ."	1
"I grew up watching and loving TNG . I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD , which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode , as the difference in style and approach between the two shows could n't be more stark . The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker 's character , which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY . They could have featured memories that would be "" new "" to the audience , rather than simply regurgitating old show clips . The in and out transitions between the "" memories "" and the "" present "" in this episode start as cliché in the beginning , and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on . Bar none- worst episode ever ."	0
I just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago , and I was very happy with the movie when I left it . It 's very intense , and the closest I 've come to crying in a movie in quite some time . That is a credit to Adam Sandler , who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels , and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it , were it not coming out so early in the year . Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam 's disturbed.There is some humor , but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments , as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him . Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable , but when he is , well , less stable he 's powerful and dark.I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss .	1
Four porn stars romping through the Irish woods sounds like a film to watch . We have Ginger Lynn Allen , Chasey Lain , Taylor Hayes , and Jenna Jameson all together in one film . Are you licking your lips ? Well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims.Yes , there was some flesh exposed - far too little considering the cast - but , it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures . There was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before , and more than one person lost their head in the situation.Unfortunately , director Christian Viel did not show much promise and I am not likely to watch his later efforts .	0
Grey Gardens is shocking , amusing , sad and mesmerizing . I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr . bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past .

"Perhaps more than many films , this one is not for everyone . For some folks the idea of slowing down , reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell . For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists , some part they long for contact with.I suppose it 's a function of where I am in my own life these days , but I count myself in the camp of the latter group . I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic , gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological . This is indeed a journey story , a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth 's presentation of Alvin Straight , though I 'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us . Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure . I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people , not just for "" acting "" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.Given the realities of production economics , I 'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly . An outsider to film production , I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression "" time is money "" is so accurately descriptive . Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed , and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story -- he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality . No simple task , that.If you 'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself , you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story . And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night ."	1
I bought this game on eBay having heard that it was a similar game to Elite . The gameplay is indeed very similar , and is very addictive . Once I 'd played it a couple of times , I immediately went back on eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too .... I have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie , it 's brilliant . If you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single - player game , simply set up a Freelancer server on your own PC ( easy to do and the software is included ) and play to your heart 's content . There are still a huge number of Freelancer servers on the Internet , so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening , because you do n't often meant other players unless you want to . So go get a copy of this game , learn it by playing the single - player campaign , then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself . The depth of this game is staggering , with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find , as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets , wormholes , secret bases , the list is nearly endless . Fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on eBay . Get one with the full written manual if you can ( blue box , not Xplosiv red box ) , it 's loads better !	1
This movie is once again , one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it . Anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a MORON ! My advise would be to take TWO not one but TWO hits of very strong acid and at least you 'll get a visual thrill out of it ! ! Although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid ! ! ! ! Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info , let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie . Unintelligble . Garbage . Schitzoid . Waste of talent . Movie is ice , with paper on destination with ringing clouds , on a sunny dive in the pudding .... Sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair . Now explain that to me ! ! ! !	0
I knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny , so I went into it with that expectation . I just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring . The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds , until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality . Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds . There is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise . It could sustain a 3 - 4 minute comedy sketch maybe , but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination .	0
Yeah , Madsen 's character - whilst talking to the woman from the TV station - is right : the LAPD IS a corrupt , violent and racist police . And this movie changes nothing about it . Okay , here are the good cops , the moral cops , even a black one , whow , a Christian , a martyr . But this is a fairy tale , admit it . Reality is not like that . And most important for the action fans : The shoot out is boring . It 's just shooting and shooting and shooting . Nothing more . Play Counter Strike , then you will at least have something to do . The only moral of this film is : The LAPD is good now . No more bad cops in it . If you like uncritical , euphemistic commercials for police and military service , watch this movie . It 's the longest commercial I 've ever seen . ( 2 Points for camera and editing ) .	0
"She has been catapulted from 13 to 30 , with magic dust involved , courtesy the 13-year - old Matt , but nothing is made of that except as an unexplained device . New York City , especially Central Park , but also every other slice of the place incorporated into the movie , seems hope - filled and easily livable , and save for Lucy there 's no villain in Jenna 's adult life , and even Lucy is not cast as monstrous , only as a nasty 13-year - old grown 17 years more devious . Chris , the one - time boy object of Jenna 's yearning , is now a porky cab driver , and you have seen enough films to know that Matt will play a major role in Jenna 's future . You do n't know quite what might impede this before it is finally achieved , though I 'm here to whisper in your ear , so to speak , that the device is not unique . In fact , not only is this a variation on the theme of Tom Hanks ' "" Big , "" though nowhere near as fine , it is also a strictly by - the - book version of this subset of the Cinderella story ."	0
Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve . It also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity . The injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience .. A must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life . I am eagerly looking forward to your next product . Hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment . Excellent work ...... Joanne	1
I have recently watched this movie twice , and I ca n't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap . I mean , yes , It gives a great impression of Hitler 's environment , and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890 's , WWI and the Inter - war period . What I ca n't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100 % pure evil , mad , unreliable , mentally unstable freak . He was after all a very thoughtful , loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides , no doubt about that . But why in heaven 's name portray him in this way ? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario , leaving nothing but a very propaganda - like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever . Yes , he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War . Yes , he was racist , and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war . All true . But again ; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public ? To warn us?I absolutely do n't think this movie was a warning . The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi 's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness . The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive ( not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people ) makes it a warning to modern civilization , NOT the fact Hitler was such a ' weirdo ' . If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded . A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler . < br />4/10	0
"I sat glued to the screen , riveted , yawning , yet keeping an attentive eye . I waited for the next awful special effect , or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force , so I could learn how not to make a movie.It seems when they set out to make this movie , the crew watched every single other action / science - fiction / shoot - em - up / good vs. evil movie ever made , and saw cool things and said : "" Hey , we can do that . "" For example , the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking , is the one car the protagonist , an attractive brunette born of bile , is thrown on to . The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it . The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie . But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility , and lack of reason for so many elements ! For example , the antagonist , a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways , happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP . Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck , you know they are already dead . Then the guy protecting the VIP says "" Under no circumstances do you leave this truck , do you understand me ? "" He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies , he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion . Then for no apparent reason , defying logic , convention , and common sense , the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK ! ! ! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie did n't make sense . Transparent acting distanced me from the movie , as well as bad camera - work , and things that just make you go : "" Wow , that 's incredibly cheesy . "" Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1 , because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience , sex appeal ."	0
Some good movies keep you in front of the TV , and you are dying to see the result.This movie does not have highs and lows . It simply describes a young girl 's family life in Africa . People come and go , the weather and the background are all the same.<br / >	0
"One question : Why ? First off , the premise is not funny or engaging at all . They use taped interviews , and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts . First off , the interviews are n't funny or entertaining to begin with , and even if they were , I am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally , without being turned into cartoons . How does that add any hilarity to it ? I turned on CBS 's Monday night sitcom line - up , ( which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays ) and found this on . Of course , the sitcom line - up would be reruns anyway , being summer , but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining . I tried to give "" CC "" a chance . I really did . When it started , I figured , well , maybe it will be funny . Nope . And then it kept going . It was a long half hour.And I can almost see if there was a purpose , if the interviews were shown in their entirety , and had points to them . But no , it was just one - line clips , cut and pasted together really quick . It was like a horrible dreadful version of Cartoon Network 's "" Robot Chicken . "" I was n't a fan of CBS ' now - cancelled sitcom "" The Class . "" WHile that was on , it was one half - hour of the line - up I would struggle through . But if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of "" Creatures"" .... let 's just say I 'd take the "" Class . "" Considering it 's been a couple hours since it aired , and I come on here to see I am the first to comment ... I guess that 's a good sign that nobody watched it , and that it wo n't last much longer . Cartoon roadkill ."	0
Moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you 're not a Michael Jackson fan . I 'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film , the ending was n't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you 're a fan.I personally believe the first 50 minutes are re - watchable many times over . The dancing in each video is breathtaking , the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining.It includes many of his finest videos from Bad and snippets from his earlier videos . It also includes some live concert footage.If you 're a big fan of Michael Jackson this is a must , if you 're not a fan / don't like Michael Jackson , steer well clear.9/10	1
"Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids . What they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers.If I had to sum up Evil Breed , it would be a low grade gore fest . The film mixes Dead Alive , Evil Dead , Wrong Turn all in one . It 's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any "" fun "" one would have watching it . The film has lots of random "" horror "" nudity ... although the film also stars four porn stars , yup four , so there could have been plenty more . Breed also showcases a good amount of gore . < br />Evil Breed has a horrible start , with laughable dialogue and horrible acting . That 's a given in a straight to video horror film , but this takes the cake . I ca n't really figure out who the main character is , since the one female who "" lives "" at the end is not really in the movie all that much . Speaking of the ending , that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film . It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one 's view of the film.You have to see this film to believe it , since there are some pretty great death scenes . There are two death scenes that come into my mind , one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest .... yea her chest , do n't ask me . The other i d when the guy gets his intestines , yet again , ripped out through his asshole . Does that kill the guy ? No , the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines . These scenes remind me so much of Dead - Alive , with the right amount of humour in each . I also got the sense of Evil Dead , with the pointless mentions of horror films and Sam Raimi . Along with Halloween , when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in.Although , the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film . When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs , her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots . Distracting indeed . As well as the continuity in the film , with only one inbred killer ? As well as which character dies at which moment . I could n't tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary 's sister / cousin ... I ca n't remember . As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body , still attached with the umbilical cord.The horrible editing is distracting as well , the opening credits are too fast and disorienting . It did have a bad start and got better , but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level . If maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film , then it would n't have been horribly butchered to death . Stay away from this film , unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore ."	0
""" House of Games "" is a flawlessly constructed film , and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends . I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert 's review , which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 . I had my doubts , mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year . Boy , was I in for a surprise . This was one of the smartest , most well - written movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work , not only in terms of the plot ( which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out ) , but also in terms of character development . On my second viewing , I began to realize that Mamet 's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film , but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations . The climax of the movie is particularly effective , because it is absolutely inevitable . It stems naturally from what we know about the characters , and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending . The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film . I can not picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike , and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset . Their work , plus Mamet 's extraordinary screenplay , combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980 's . It is truly a must - see ."	1
This is one of the worst movies ever made . Trite . Predictable . Flat.The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona . I imagine they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects.Often bad movies have some redeeming features , this has nothing . If I was in it or worked on it , I would change my name . Truly a turd . Hard to write more than this , but I feel the world 's film watchers needed a head 's up on this . On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you ca n't stand.You could send it to politicians you dislike , in laws , ex - wives , Teachers you hated , former employees , Dick Cheney , W. , and a host of others .	0
"This was another World War II message to the soldiers and to the Allies to be careful about spreading rumors . These were called "" instructional "" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny - looking main character called "" Pvt . Snafu . ""All of us have imaginations , along with fears and what - have - you , and that 's what happens here as Pvt . Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with "" five . "" You can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them . That includes losing confidence in your country and your cause , as pointed out here in this cartoon . A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy . That 's still being done today . < br />""We lost the war , "" declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon . Amazing how some Americans still have n't learned . This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today . As I write this , there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the "" War On Terror "" is just a bumper sticker slogan . Amazing.The writer , the famous "" Dr. Suess , "" uses analogies of "" hot air balloon juice "" here to present the above message . With Theodore Geisel ( his real name ) you know the rhymes will be clever.Nothing hilarious here , but it was n't meant to be . You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during World War II . People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning . It was a tense time"	1
This Academy Award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre . Told completely without dialogue , it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish , lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school , leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open . After a while , a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around , comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl . The fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited . As the cat comes very near to the bowl , the fish jumps out . The cat catches the fish , drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy , not knowing what has happened , gets back . This was amazingly filmed with real animals ; how Cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable . I only wish this film were available now for people to see ; I only saw it once , in 1959 when it was originally released , but it has remained unforgettable .	1
This movie has a special way of telling the story , at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and I had no idea what s happening.Anyway the story line was although simple , but still very real and touching . You met someone the first time , you fell in love completely , but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony . Who has n't go through this ? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life . < br />I would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters . I just wish that the story could be a happy ending .	1
This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy . It 's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals do n't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own . The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name . Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound . Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things . Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time . There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it is n't cheesy at all . It 's the best talking animal movie that I 've seen so far . It 's a really good movie for families .	1
"The only redemption was the small part by Larry Miller . It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be "" Something About Mary , "" but I did n't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards . The actor who plays Paul was great , but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her Cruel Intentions character . James Brolin was great , but Paul 's father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoon 's Vacation movies ."	0
"Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s ( ok , so Katie did n't join the Manson Family , and nobody died at Altamont ) , this movie was still unbelievably awful . I got the impression that the "" writers "" just locked themselves in a room and watched "" Forrest Gump , "" "" The Wonder Years , "" and Oliver Stone 's 60s films over and over again and called it research . A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "" head spinning "" . He was right ."	0
Eye in the Labyrinth is not your average Giallo ... and to be honest , I 'm not really sure that it really is a Giallo ; but Giallo or not , despite some problems , this is certainly a very interesting little film . I 'm hesitant to call it a Giallo because the film does n't feature most of the things that make these films what they are ; but many genre entries break the mould , and this would seem to be one of them . The film does n't feature any brutal murders as many Giallo 's do , but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration . The plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by Julie , his patient who , for some reason , she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her . We then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people , but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before Julie 's arrival ... The film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth . This never really comes off , and I preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point ( if any ) the film is trying to make . Eye in the Labyrinth is directed by Mario Caiano , the director behind the excellent Night of the Doomed some years earlier . He does n't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one ; but the surreal aspects of the story come off well , and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring . The film stars Rosemary Dexter , who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance . Most of the rest of the cast are n't really worth mentioning , with the exceptions of Adolfo Celi , who is good as the villain of the piece and Alida Valli , whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks . The film does explain itself at the end ; which is lucky as I 'm sure I 'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then ! Overall , this may not be classic stuff ; but its good enough and worth seeing .	1
"This movie is bad . I do n't just mean ' bad ' as in ; "" Oh the script was bad "" , or ; "" The acting in that scene was bad"" ..... I mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public . I wo n't even dignify it with an explanation of the ( Plot ? ? ) if I can refer to it as that . I can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that I have found need to vent my spleen on a movie . I mean , after all , no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie , do they ? Well , yes . Apparently they do ... and the guilty man is writer / director Ulli Lommel . But the worst of it is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers ! Be advised . Leave this crap where it belongs . Stuck on the shelf , gathering dust ."	0
"Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not - quite-90-minutes of my life . There was n't a laugh to be had ; in fact , I do n't remember ever cracking a smile . Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle - aged chain - smoking dog hoarder , the textbook overbearing mother character , a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder . She is manipulative , conniving , melodramatic , childish , narcissistic , and worst of all , boring.I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters , but why bother ? It was just a long string of movie clichés -- the dippy , socially inept distant relative who 's just trying to break into "" The Industry "" , the gruff and long - suffering but somehow still lovable father , the mild- mannered wife who just ca n't take it anymore ( but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home ) , the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away , etc.God , what a snore . I 've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why . Overacting is overacting , no matter how many pictures you did in your prime . Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating . What was the director thinking?While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler , their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie . That was okay , because neither did I. Keaton 's endless self - absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times Shepard 's dislike for her seemed genuine . By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her myself.Awful ."	0
George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress . She is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune . He interviews her on her yacht . They fall for each other in bathing costumes.It turns out ( quite early ) that she is not an heiress . She part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.The movie follows the ups and downs of their romance.The supporting cast does little to buoy it up . Davis and Brent carry the picture . Though it 's fairly predictable , it is also fairly entertaining . It 's far from her best . But , especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre , it 's not one of her worst , either .	0
This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline . The problem is , Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story . More troubling is the fact that the director of the film , Charles Ferguson -- a former think tank wonk , was a war supporter until the occupation went south . What did he think would happen ? < br />The invasion of Poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky Nazis . And that is what this film feels like -- an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself . < br />Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better -- as if any war can be better .	0
"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy : the good guy , the idiot , the pervert , the rich girl ... but it 's set on the 70 's . That 's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies . I do n't know how you can like this show . Its humor is pathetic ! I mean , the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialog is this : "" Fez : Oh , Jackie I want to have sex with you . ( audience laughs ) Jackie : Fez you 're a pervert . ( audience laughs ) Fez : Oh yes I am . ( audience cheers and applauds ) "" This is n't funny . I think that if it did n't have those laughs ( I do n't know how you call that in English , sorry ) you would n't laugh at all . This is n't intelligent comedy , this is an insult to the public . I like most of the American comedies , but this is n't good at all . I would give it 4 out of 10 .

How can a movie be both controversial and gentle ? This one does it with a near - perfect structure . No one wants their daughters to be athletes . Apparently most cultures do n't want their daughters to be small - breasted , either . Here we see a bunch of superb actors we 've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to , and have the potential to , become professional soccer players . The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful . There is no condescension . Both cultures are seen as modern and valid . ( And yes , both are silly , too ) . One flaw : the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them .	1
"We do n't have this on television in England but I walked it over the Internet on YouTube . It 's dumb , immature and boring ! This is from the creator of "" Earthworm Jim "" Douglas TenNapel , I never got into that cartoon but I must admit it better than this . The cartoonist has n't done anything for years since now . For Doug TenNapel , this is a comeback travesty and an all time low ! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master . They are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on . "" BORING "" ! The animation is dreadful . The main characters are meant to be cats , right ? But they do n't look nothing like cats ! Just weird animal monster - looking creatures with big mouths , pointed teeth and bulgy eyes ! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly ! The theme song is terrible and irritating ! Also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows . It surprised me how this show got 7.5/10 votes of other IMDb viewers . Television really is n't what is used to be ! But now most of them is dumb , cheaply made and boring . Some of you on the website might not agree with me well I 'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that Britain do n't have too tolerate this crap ( oh yeah , if you have digital you have to ) but I do n't , so it not my problem ! Loser ! 2/10 ( and it 's very lucky to get that because I 've given other shows worst ! ) ."	0
In 1948 this was my all - time favorite movie . Betty Grable 's costumes were so ravishing that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that . Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , was irresistible as the dashing Hungarian officer . Silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first , when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women .

"The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy . Seen in that light , it does deliver . < br />If you 're looking for a serious movie , look somewhere else . This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of "" issues "" with no insight whatsoever.Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable , stereotypical ways . < br />Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable , and Michael Rappaport turns in a good performance , but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite , it 's hard to find anything redeeming ."	0
"I loved this movie . It was so well done ! Great acting and drama and historically accurate . I love Romy Schneider movies . This one rocks , not as great as Sissi but still rocks ! < br />And Scorpiolina , she commented and said french dubbing . Well this is originally a German movie not french . So yea . Second of all there was a plot , maybe your not familiar with history . Oh and her mother played the part of her governess , not her teacher . And the storyline was actually not Cinderella but Queen Victoria , maybe u missed that detail.But anyway .... yea the history in this movie is great , I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating ! I love all the historical stuff . Like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom . And when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the "" new type of dance "" waltzing . When waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close . Yea her governess was like oh my god!And also the clothes , I love the clothes . The styles are great , hoop skirts are awesome . And of course Romy always looks very pretty ."	1
"The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business ( albeit a unique one ) all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis , are examined in the dark and absorbing drama , ` Panic , ' written and directed by Henry Bromell , and starring William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland . It 's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must , of necessity , at last be resolved.<br / > 	 Alex ( Macy ) is tired ; he has a loving wife , Martha ( Tracey Ullman ) , a precocious six - year - old son , Sammy ( David Dorfman ) , a mail order business he runs out of the house , as well as his main source of income , the ` family ' business he shares with his father , Michael ( Sutherland ) , and his mother , Deidre ( Barbara Bain ) . But he 's empty ; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached , putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist , Dr. Josh Parks ( John Ritter ) . And to make matters worse ( or maybe better , depending upon perspective ) , in Dr. Parks ' waiting room he meets a young woman , Sarah Cassidy ( Neve Campbell ) , whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember . She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him , as in the days after their meeting he simply can not stop thinking about her . His whole life , it seems , has become a ` situation'-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves . He can deny his age and the fact that he has , indeed , slipped into a genuine midlife crisis , but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own . He 's at a crossroads , and he 's going to have to decide which way to go . And he 's going to have to do it very soon.<br / > 	 From a concept that is intrinsically interesting , Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive , and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through . He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers , that in real life there is no easy way out . His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and , moreover , within any given family unit . The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny , with irrevocable consequences and effects . When you 're growing up , you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large ; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet , and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son . And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds ; ergo , the midlife crisis , or more specifically , the crisis of conscience from which he can not escape . It 's a powerful message , succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell , with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.<br / > 	 For some time , William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business , creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in ` Magnolia , ' The Shoveler in ` Mystery Men ' and Jerry Lundegaard in ` Fargo . ' And that 's just a sampling of his many achievements . At one point in this film , Sarah mentions Alex 's ` sad eyes , ' and it 's a very telling comment , as therein lies the strength of Macy 's performance here , his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated , believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing . Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed , staring off into the darkness ; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling , not only with his immediate situation , but with everything in his life that has brought him , finally , to this point . In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt , confusion and uncertainty , all of which have been successfully suppressed until now ; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex 's life , only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing , demanding confrontation and resolution . It 's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable . It 's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate . It 's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.<br / > 	 Sutherland is extremely effective , as well ; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it 's chilling . It 's frightening , in fact , to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth . This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain , but a true personification of evil , hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door , which is what makes it all the more disconcerting . And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly , with a great performance.<br / > 	 Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah , but her performance ( as is the usual case with her ) seems somewhat pretentious , although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film . If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward , it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters . ` Panic , ' however , is one of her best efforts ; a powerful film that , in the end , is a journey well worth taking . 9/10 . < br /><br / >"	1
Julie Waters is always marvelous but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender - bent comedy about a transvestite who can not suppress his obsession , and the changes he goes through when he 's discovered . Unerringly eschews the vulgar , raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight , and has an absolute ball while doing it . A very nice , low - key , feel - good , comedy	1
"One of the most unheralded great works of animation . Though it makes the most sophisticated use of the "" cut - out "" method of animation ( a la "" South Park "" ) , the real talent behind "" Twice Upon a Time "" are the vocal characterizations , with Lorenzo Music 's ( Carlton from TV 's "" Rhoda "" ) Woody Allen - ish Ralph - the - all - purpose - Animal being the centerpiece . The "" accidental nightmare "" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed ."	1
"Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time , and is certainly a milestone in human culture , civilization and artistic expression ! ! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece , Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century , such as Francis Ford Copola , Martin Scorcese , Orson Welles and Roman Polanski . The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking , and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary . At the time of it 's release , Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film - making to levels never anticipated by film makers . The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur , but adapting an action packed , thrilling detective novel , co - staring a "" talking "" dinosaur with a post - modern name such as "" Theodore "" , and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it . The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty . Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say "" you are my most beloved creation . "" This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR ! ! !"	1
"Collusion Course is even worse than the typical "" evil white male corporate capitalist "" movie of the week . This movie is less pleasant than a toothache . Jay Leno can act . He 's good in his underrated debut movie , The Silverbears , in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character . This movie is so bad Leno 's character , a sanctimonious buffoon , is less annoying than Morita 's character , a sanctimonious fool ."	0
I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video . It was always one of my favorite sci - fi and/or Charlton Heston films.Recently , the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective . I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print . From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.Their chemistry together is wonderful . The film also looks so much better in a great 35 mm print . Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works . The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . Just think how the world population grew , the rain forest that disappeared , resources used up , green house effect getting worse since 1973 . I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . Its reputation should be better.Speaking of reputations , often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor . Seeing him in El - Cid , Soylent Green , The Warlord , The Omega Man , Will Penny , and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors . Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.<br / >	1
I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first . It would n't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money . The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world . Justin Timberlake did a good job . I was n't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job . Considering it is his first movie he did a good job . This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just do n't know what you want to rent that night . It should go pretty well . The cast was great . So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out !	1
Takashi Miike 's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . Even as a kid , I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children 's books . Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never - ending hazardous missions . Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers . He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . But a self - possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . I thought it was a great film . Highly recommended .	1
"L'Hypothèse du tableau volé / The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting ( 1979 ) begins in the courtyard of an old , three - story Parisian apartment building . Inside , we meet The Collector , an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist - era painter , Tonnerre . A narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting , and then engages in a dialogue with The Collector , who describes the paintings to us , shows them to us , tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down , and then tells us he 's going to show us something .... As he walks through a doorway , we enter another world , or worlds , or perhaps to stretch to the limits , other possible worlds . The Collector shows us through his apparently limitless house , including a large yard full of trees with a hill ; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life , or half - way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting , of the work as a whole , of a whole secret history behind the paintings , the scandal , the people in the paintings , the novel that may have inspired the paintings . And so on , and so on . Every room , every description , leads us deeper into a labyrinth , and all the while The Collector and The Narrator engage in their separate monologues , very occasionally verging into dialogue , but mostly staying separate and different.I watched this a second time , so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was , and so challenging to think or write about . If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to , it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation . An indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which The Collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them , he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection , which is now partially composed of life - size versions of the figures . If we think too much about it and do n't just enjoy it , it all becomes just faceless plastic .... Whether I 've come to any definite conclusions about "" L'Hypothèse du tableau volé "" , or not , I can say definitely that outside of the early ( and contemporaneous ) works of Peter Greenaway like "" A Walk Through H "" , I 've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep , so serious , so dense .... and at heart , so mischievous and fun ."	1
"One of the most appealing elements of a Gilliam film is that the well - concocted visuals , the unsettling backdrops , and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator 's involvement . Instead of most movies ( where the filmmaker is some director - for - hire that is paid to feature a star or two ) , you can feel Terry Gilliam 's presence through the experience . "" 12 Monkeys "" is evidence of Gilliam 's own vision and style , as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake . "" 12 Monkeys "" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam 's repertoire : oppressive / recessive societies , the solitude of the protagonist , the frustration associated with disbelief , and parallel realms . In this film Gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms , using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know . This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art - house pretentiousness . The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam 's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning . The two nearly identical bathing scenes of Cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled . His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease - ridden future world , yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world . The title itself is a mark of Gilliam 's creativity , as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood . All in all , Gilliam 's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience . The film has immense re - watch value , since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing . Definitely one of my favorites ."	1
after seeing this excellent film over 100 times , i still find new things that blow me away with this movie , great special effects , incredible acting , and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism , and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well . best movie ever ! ! !	1
"OK , how 's this for original- this mean , rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children , all of them ungrateful losers , and two creepy servants , provided they spend the week in his spooky old house . What happens that night will surprise only those who have n't seen a movie or television show before . After a string of murders in which the victims look like they 're bleeding restaurant ketchup , we have a painfully obvious twist ending . The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks . There are also a few second - tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now . As a result , the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "" Matlock . "" I will give credit where it 's due- the closing scene is clever and amusing , if you 're still awake ."	0
"Set in World Depression Era Prague , this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters , only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop , who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague . Add a little twist ( the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- is having an affair with the owner 's wife ) , leaving Stewart briefly ' fired ' , along with an admission that the sales girl ' liked ' Stewart all along , the happy ending is inevitable.Although VERY dated ( references to poverty and -I have a wife and two kids to consider- are over - used , along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure , like a musical cigar box , are out - of - reach for common people 's enjoyment ) , this film is much more effective ( and more credible ) than the 1990s re - make "" You 've Got Mail "" . In the re - make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan , the actual odds of the chain - of - events are so unbelievable that the viewer 's intelligence is grossly offended.""Shop Around The Corner "" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated , less hectic , and more romantic time and place known as a novelist 's Utopia . Lovers of Classic Romantic Comedies will enjoy this picture !"	1
"What a stunning episode for this fine series . This is television excellence at its best . The story takes place in 1968 and it 's beautifully filmed in black & white , almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images . This is a story about two men who fall in love , but I do n't want to spoil this . It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America . Written by the superb Tom Pettit , and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc , we move through their lives , their love for each other , and their tragedy . Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning . Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters . Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan 's gorgeous , "" Ah , but I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now , "" as sung by the Byrds . This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars . Beautiful ."	1
I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I , along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience , were vastly disappointed . The movie was n't even so bad it was good ; it was as lifeless as a snake - bite victim . Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies , except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . It all seemed worn , flat , and overtly formulaic . I 'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun . It 's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it 's a piece of s*it and plays along with it , but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . It 's the worst kind of lame movie : it 's joyless .	0
"Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes.I love 50 sci fi , I even love cheesy 50s sci fi , but this film is really , really bad .

This film requires a mute button and fast forward feature.That said , I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so ."	0
"This movie sucked ! They took something from my childhood , and raped it in an outhouse ! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my "" Dukes "" dvds and cry in a corner .

Now do n't get me wrong , I'm very liberal and there 's nothing wrong with a little chiba , but it had no place in this movie !

I really hate this show ! I had watched one episode , and I knew this show is really terrible . The story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad ...

"This film Evil Breed : The legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort . It is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast "" slasher "" style death and plain disgusting acts of death . The acting was rated a D as the actors show very little ability , and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable . The way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different . The odd split of porn is fit in thought it really does n't offer much , and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death . Example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus , and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes . It is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up . This film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture ."	1
< br />Back in his youth , the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin , but his family forbid it . Many decades later , the old man has raised three children ( two boys and one girl ) , and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children . Soon , the sister is bored with brother # 1 , and jumps in the bed of brother # 2.One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island . But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non - related female and the two brothers . Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non - related male and the one sister . All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing . The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage - minded girls all over him , but no -- he only wanted his sister ? If movie incest is your cup of tea , then SUNSHINE will ( slowly ) thrill you to no end .	0
"The wonderful "" Z "" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after "" Butterfly "" . I had such high hopes for the actress , and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film.Again , it was the 80 's and I got ta tell you Harold Robbin 's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers . Jacqueline Susann ripped into him ( she hated his way of writing women ) , Irwin Shaw 's work caught on with many women , and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70 's early 80 's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books , even more so . Which is why this work smelt . Harold Robbin 's work in the 80 's just did n't catch on with audiences . Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin 's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire . The supporting cast was not a help either.Oooooh ... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later , it looks even worse . I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done . It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress ( although John Waters casting her in "" Hairspray "" was a spark ) although she has a nice singing voice.Hey , Pia , wherever you are ... Hairspray may go on tour ! Join the show . You may be the biggest comeback story yet.I just hope they burn this film for ya if you do ."	0
This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth . Sadly , though , after priming us with this , the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non - stop attack on Christianity , and pretty much focusing on the easy targets.The writer / director clearly has some issues with the Church ( he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger ) and this film seems to be his form of release . It 'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded , but as a whole , the movie is disappointing .	0
"I 've read a number of reviews on this film and I have to say "" What is wrong with you people ? ! ? ! "" This was an excellent film ! I thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told . I 'm convinced that the people that did n't like this film were n't paying very good attention to the film . There are a number of very important scenes that if you are n't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense . I urge anyone who did n't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention . The story made perfect sense to me and as I said , was very well told . Every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film.All the actors did a fantastic job ! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always . Laurence Fishburne was superb as Tanny Brown , playing a very interesting character . Kate Capshaw was a nice touch as well , and looks fantastic . Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise , I did n't really expect anything great from him , but he pulled off a great performance . Ed Harris was the real gem in the film . He plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is . Watch his eyes in his scenes , just superb ! ! ! Also , there is a very young Scarlett Johansson ( as Kate ) in one of her first roles ... not a bad place to start . Excellent cast in this film!I would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers . This is a great film and should be seen . Do n't listen all these other people 's opinions , go see the movie and come to your own conclusions . I hope that you will see the film , and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do . Thanks for reading,-Chris"	1
How truly friendly , charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial ; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi . It is disarmingly friendly and lively . It 's the document of a longlost craft . ( The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials . ) CHANDU is deeply , deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind . It 's not stupid ; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work . CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple , unpretentious and friendly fun.Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.As to the quite sexy niece , Nadji , she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti : the sordid Vindhyan . The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower ; almost kidnapped from a boat ; by a phony policeman ; the temple of Lemuria and its strange , creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals . < br />Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does?Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless , mean drunk , and this only contributed to his performances . He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle , mischievous and cunning and oblique . This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosiyet Burton 's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor . I enjoy Lugosi ' fancy performances.This serial is unjustly bashed .	1

I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made . If you doubt me , please look at my other reviews . However , for the first time ever , I have seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over.I LOVE bad movies . To me , Ed Wood is a genius , I thought Bloody Murder , Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good . However , there is not a single good thing I can say about this film.The plot is basically non existent . If someone reading my review wastes their money to see it , they can discern for themselves what the plot might be , but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.The special effects are bad.The acting is bad.The two leads are attractive , but that 's all there is.I am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone , but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it . I will tell you anything.I love bad movies , and I love horror and I love new inventive movies . I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel ( Which some reviewers claimed this was like , but obviously they only thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2 ) . But this may be the Number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie EVER made.And before you disregard this review , this is coming from someone who not only sat through the ENTIRE premiere of House of the Dead , but actually bought a copy of it .	0
The person 's comment that said that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is . His definition of evil is the opposite of evil . The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good ! He does n't even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy ! If you do n't know God and refuse to know him now , that 's okay . He still loves you but when you do finally bow your knee to Him , and you will , it will be too late for you . God sends no one to hell , not even you ! You will go there of your own decision and your spewing defines it ! May God have mercy on you and give you a Damascus Road experience . The 700 Club and Pat Robertson 's ministry is one of the reasons I 'm still here . On the edge of alcoholism , adultery , and probably death , God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it , and thank God He did ! You have a right to say what you said but you do n't have a right to curse with your words . God have mercy on you .	1
I was really surprised with this movie . Going in to the sneak preview , knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I 'd seen , I thought it was going to be a Dude Where 's My Car kind of crap fest . I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that 's just how movies work . Instead I got a smart , surprisingly original movie about a decent , average guy who just never had sex.Yes , the film is chock full o ' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey - look - a - nipple ! , but it 's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys . All the characters are people you probably know in real life , redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap , and I was very surprised . Yea , it 's pretty over the top ( c'mon , it 's a movie about a 40 year old virgin ! ) , but it 's very smartly done.In the end , you 're really pulling for this guy to get laid , which says a lot about the movie because honestly , did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not ?	1
I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back . So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay - for - view channel I was intrigued . I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for Vietnam . I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most heart - wrenching film I have ever seen . I bought the DVD immediately after renting it . The way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something I 've never experienced with any other film . As far as Vietnam subject films go , I think it is the best one , although Platoon runs a close second . Besides all of that , I think it is also Colin Farrell 's best performance as an actor . I like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible . I gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies .	1
"Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse . Chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property , Manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods . He reports the crime to the police but there 's no body to be found . Troubled by disturbing visions , he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn  "" Soft for Digging "" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare . This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue . Some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent . The location sets provide plenty of creepiness : the eerie Maryland woods rival those used in "" The Blair Witch Projcect"" . Give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10 ."	1
I loved this movie . First , because it is a family movie . Second , because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family , with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies . The brothers are very close , yet are not judgmental . Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble , but not needed in the end . I understand that Leo 's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people , but I believed it was the right choice for him . I ca n't believe that this was a french television programme . It had great production values . I gave this movie a ten , and I think you will too , once you have seen it .	1
' Renaissance ( 2006 ) ' was created over a period of six years , co - funded by France , Luxembourg and the United Kingdom at a cost of around 14 million . The final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic - book style animation , aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with ' Sin City ( 2005 ) , ' but this film employed motion capture with live - actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format . Presented in stark black - and - white , the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based , and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us . Directed by French filmmaker Christian Volckman , in his feature - length debut , ' Renaissance ' draws significantly from other films in the science - fiction genre , and the tech - noir storyline is n't something we have n't seen before , but , from a technical standpoint , it is faultless.The year is 2054 . The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths , the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings . The city 's largest corporation , Avalon , achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth , and the company 's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process . Ilona Tasuiev ( voiced by Romola Garai in the English - language version , which I watched ) , a brilliant young scientist , is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work , and so it falls to legendary detective Barthélémy Karas ( Daniel Craig ) to uncover her current whereabouts . Possibly holding the key to the woman 's disappearance is Bislane ( Catherine McCormack ) , Ilona 's hardened elder sister , whose trustworthiness is in question , and Jonas Muller ( Ian Holm ) , the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughter.The eerie , dimly - lit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scott 's ' Blade Runner ( 1982 ) , ' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from Tom Cruise in ' Minority Report ( 2002 ) ' { which was , coincidentally , also set in the year 2054 } . However , despite this familiarity , Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit . Blending classic film - noir and science - fiction , the result is an eye - catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows , which , I should warn , occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer 's eyes . The dialogue is a little banal at times , and the story , though engaging , does n't offer anything strikingly original { except for the ending , which I thought was a bold twist on the usual formula } , but ' Renaissance ' is intended to work best as a visual treat , and that it succeeds in this regard can not be denied .	1
The romance of the movie , which is also its main theme , is good and nicely presented . However , the surrounding of the love story is too lyric , graphical and unrealistic . Even worse , the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible , exactly like the end of the movie . Do n't hesitate to watch this movie , if it attracted your interest , but do n't expect too much of it either .	1
"I found this movie hilarious . The spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest I have seen in this sort of movie . Give it a try . If you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing , and you get the humor , you should enjoy the movie.I ( and the others who watched the movie with me ) felt the funniest part in the movie ( this is not a spoiler because I will NOT tell you what actually happens ) was a scene with the "" flashy thingy "" from MIB . When they first discover the device and do not know what it is does ... and then again later in the movie ... you 'll understand when you get there.My only complaint about the movie is that I have never been able to find it in DVD so that I could buy a copy ."	1
Vijay Krishna Acharya 's ' Tashan ' is a over - hyped , stylized , product . Sure its a one of the most stylish films , but when it comes to content , even the masses will reject this one . Why ? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby . Script is king , without a good script even the greatest director of all - time can not do anything . Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner ' Yash Raj Films ' and Mega Stars appearing in it . But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . Thumbs down ! < br />Performances : Anil Kapoor , is a veteran actor . But how could he okay a role like this ? Akshay Kumar is great actor , in fact he 's the sole saving grace . Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot . She looks stunning and leaves you , all stand up . Saif Ali Khan does n't get his due in here . Sanjay Mishra , Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.'Tashan ' is a boring film . The films failure at the box office , should you keep away .	0
I sat through this turkey because I had n't seen it before , and because the premise sounded like it had potential . It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence . At the height of the storm , the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house , yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving ! In fact , when the characters move outside the house , bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops . At that point , whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film . Too bad all hurricanes are n't like this one , it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State .	0
The absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty Dane Douglas Sirk ( born Detlef Sierck ) , Written on the Wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame . From its justly famous opening sequence , with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a Texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback , the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later , little - screen knockoffs as Dallas , Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years - long runs.The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme Americans , in our dollar - based society , find irresistible . Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled , troubled heirs to the Hadly oil fortune ; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron . ( It 's been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann 's marriage into Reynolds tobacco money . ) As always , the misfits get all the scenery to chew -- and the best lines to spit out ( Malone , in her Oscar - nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson , gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them ) . Hudson , while good , ca n't compete with all this over - the - top emoting ; Bacall starts out strong but grows recessive , a mere plot convenience . No matter ; with a succession of set - pieces shot in extravagant hues , Sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s America . Nobody ever did it better .	1
"I happened across "" Bait "" on cable one night just as it started and thought , "" Eh , why not ? "" I 'm glad I gave it a chance . < br />""Bait "" ai n't perfect . It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness . But overall , this movie worked . All the elements aligned just right , and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film . < br />Most of that , I think , is due to Jamie Foxx . I do n't know who tagged Foxx for the lead , but whoever it was did this movie a big favor . Believable and amazingly likeable , Foxx glides through the movie , smooth as butter and funnier than hell . You can tell he 's working on instinct , and instinct does n't fail him.The plot , while unimportant , actually ties together pretty well , and there 's even a character arc through which Foxx 's character grows as a person . Again , they could 've slipped by without any of this , but it just makes things that much better.I'm surprised at the low rating for this . Maybe I just caught this move on the right night , or vice versa , but I 'd give it a 7/10 . Bravo , Mssr . Foxx ."	1
For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time . No exceptions . James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller . Through films such as Aliens , The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science - fiction goes . He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film . But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance . The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises , plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows . The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful , interesting and entertaining film about it . The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters are n't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose ( Gloria Stuart ) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose 's and Jack 's story alone , no one else . Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home . The music has become iconic and legendary . It is composer James Horner 's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience . The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is . Only one problem , the usual James Cameron problem , is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside . James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime . My heart wo n't go on from this one .	1
"A group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find fossils . They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground eventually ( the did n't notice it in the dark ) , The scenes of the CGI Bigfoot are horrid , but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate . I used to think that there just might be a good Bigfoot movie to be made . But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend , I 'm having serious doubts . To pour salt in the wound of watching this film , the ONE good - looking girl just does n't get naked once . And while this one MAY be better than "" Boggy Creek 2 "" ( no mean feat there ) , it 's still sad that the best non - documentary film on Bigfoot remains "" Harry and the Henriksons "" < br />My Grade : D"	0
I have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm , happy feeling . I felt as if I had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time ! I thoroughly enjoyed this film . The acting was superb , although I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance . Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films . Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance . And Billy Connolly , as always , totally gorgeous . It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned . Such a refreshing experience to see a well - written , superbly acted and good - looking movie .	1
' The Rookie ' was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience , making them realize that your dreams can come true . If you loved ' Remember the Titans ' , ' The Rookie ' is the movie for you ! ! It 's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages . ' The Rookie ' hits a major home run !	1
"This is not really a zombie film , if we 're defining zombies as the dead walking around . Here the protagonist , Armand Louque ( played by an unbelievably young Dean Jagger ) , gains control of a method to create zombies , though in fact , his ' method ' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people 's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves . This is an interesting concept for a movie , and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of ' Dr. Mabuse ' films , including ' Dr. Mabuse the Gambler ' ( 1922 ) and ' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse ' ( 1933 ) . Here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancée , Claire Duvall ( played by the Anne Heche look alike with a bad hairdo , Dorothy Stone ) which is really the major theme.The movie has an intriguing beginning , as Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there . At some type of compound ( where we get great 30s sets and clothes ) he announces his engagement to Claire , and then barely five minutes later , she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal , Clifford Greyson ( Robert Noland ) . It 's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact . This would have been a great movie for ' Mystery Science Theater 3000 ' , if they had n't already roasted it.It 's never shown how Louque actually learns the ' zombification ' secret , but he then uses it to kill his enemies , create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards . We wo n't see such sheer force of will until John Agar in ' The Brain From Planet Arous ' ( 1957).Finally Claire consents to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America . Louque agrees , but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves . On their wedding night he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his ' powers . ' To gain her love , he does so , causing the ' revolt ' of the title , in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him . Greyson embraces Claire , and we seem to be at the end of a parable : "" Whom the gods would destroy , they first make mad . "" < br />So really then , it 's not that bad of a film , despite the low IMDb rating it currently has . On repeated viewings ( ? ) one can see the artistry in the well formed script ! Dean Jagger had yet to develop into a good actor , and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness -- is that really his own hair ? We remember him more for his bald , old man roles in ' White Christmas ' ( 1954 ) , ' X The Unknown ' ( 1956 ) and ' King Creole ' ( 1958 ) . The story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better , earlier film ' White Zombie ' ( 1932 ) in which hapless Robert Frazier ( as Charles Beaumont ) uses ' zombification ' to win the love of Madge Bellamy ( as Madeline Parker).If you want real zombie movies ( of which there are hundreds ! ) I 'd start with ' White Zombie ' ( 1932 ) , ' King of the Zombies ' ( 1941 ) , ' I Walked with a Zombie ' ( 1943 ) , ' Night of the Living Dead ' ( 1968 ) , ' The Last Man on Earth ' ( 1964 ) and its two remakes . In the modern era of classy films , there are ' Horror Express ' ( 1972 ) , ' The Serpent and the Rainbow ' ( 1988 ) , ' 28 Days Later ' ( 2002 ) and its sequel , as well as many , many , others too numerous to mention.This one is not really a zombie film . Judging this movie on its own terms , it 's more of a semi - Gothic romance . As such it ranks a little below some of Universal 's bottom billed B horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s . So I 'll give it a 5 ."	0
Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment . Simply referencing movies , like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy . The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter . The movie plummets from there unfortunately . The acting is awful . Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place . The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced . Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie , involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie , were nt funny to anyone in my theater . The movie , thankfully , comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending . ( I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor ) I do nt know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers . Overall , a very poorly done movie .	0
"I just loved watching it though and having fun with it 's total badness of a film . I saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD . If you flip the to the other side of the DVD , they show the actual movie , so I gave it a chance . Seriously , folks this is grilled cheese.The acting , special effects , and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic . "" Does n't she need lungs "" said Crow noticing how the head can still talk while it does n't have a body , and Tom Servo just wistfully remarks "" No , she 's got neck juice ! "" . The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K - Porn ! I loved the "" cat fight "" between the two strippers . That "" Meow "" after the fight or scene , whatever , was classic . So , in some ways this was a fun movie . I think for horror fans , you 'll probably enjoy it . For a good time , watch the MSTK3 version , you 'll get a great laugh.MST3 K version : 10/10 The Brain that would die : 1/10"	0
This is an OK adaptation , but not as good as the TV version . The actors are generally alright but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley , particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version . Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but again , I preferred Kate Beckinsale 's Emma . There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette , Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson.The script is often played too much for laughs , the book is a comedy , but there are too many set - piece gags here , and also the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent.My biggest criticism is the scenery . It is far too lush . England has never been like this . It looks like a chocolate box . Only Americans would make it like this.Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more .	1
I absolutely hate this programme , what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ? ? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I 'm well out of the room before it comes on . Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i ca nt stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless . What happened to detective programmes with real mystery ? ? ? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago ? ? ? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this .	0
THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon 's most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger , who is an obsessive neat freak , who moves in with his divorced best friend , Oscar Madison , a sportswriter and complete slob , after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment . Already divorced , Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it . Neil Simon 's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar . Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger . Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger . Matthau , fortunately , was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar , a one - of - a - kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout . This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re - visited in nine other films . With both of these actors no longer with us , the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious . Simon 's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix 's suicide attempt that is a winner . The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman , John Fiedler , Larry Haines , and David Sheiner as Oscar 's poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters , blind dates of Oscar and Felix . Of course , it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman , but there 's nothing like the original . A joy from start to finish .	1

"If you watched this movie you know why I said "" Jesus , Jesus , Jesus "" . Hehehe ! ! ! Every time they said "" Jesus , Jesus , Jesus "" ... I laughed thinking "" Jesus , Jesus , Jesus , why did I rent this movie "" ?

I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job ! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him ... but I really prefer an actor , not this android called Timberlake . And his girlfriend was shallow , hollow and annoying as hell . I was happy when they both were popped in the street.The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well . The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all . It would have been much enjoyable without him.By the way , the music was OK , but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes , low motion and things like that . Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought . Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake ."	0
"I knew nothing of this film before I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a "" non - stop epic battle scene from beginning to end "" . That could n't have been further from the truth . This was one of the most boring , poorly written , amateurishly directed , horribly acted films I 've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon . I 'd rank it up there with the movie I consider to be the worst film of all time ... Battlefield Earth . There basically is no story , it 's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact . It also features some of the worst dialogue I 've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells girl "" You smell like the moon . "" . Girl replies "" What does the moon smell like ? "" OMG ! You have to be kidding me ! The scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound FX of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth . If this is playing at a theater near you , avoid it at all costs . This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that I needed to catch up on my sleep ... and I did . Awful ."	0
The clichéd Polynesian males drink , fight and make a stream of sexist , stupid and unfunny remarks . Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped , cardboard characters . The supposedly Samoan girl did n't look or act Samoan at all , seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim . With weak as water story lines you ca n't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script . It 's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene , and only two or three ' jokes ' . What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers ' money , what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community . It 's better not to make movies if they 're as bad and mindless as this .	0
A group of friends come face - to - face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful German countryside.The ' mutant cannibal family ' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home , so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress . With Barricade , Timo Rose tries to give the well - worn routine a Teutonic twist , by transplanting the action to The Black Forest and giving it the German low - budget splatter treatment . The result is a very bloody , but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsin particular , the non - stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques.Had Timo Rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him , then Barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore - fest : his inexperienced cast do reasonably well ; the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning ; and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments . All of this , however , is completely ruined by the awful camera - work , choppy editing , and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today 's film - makers.I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore , which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid , loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements , and some pretty decent shotgun damage .	0

"Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes , "" Salaam - e - Ishq "" is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love ( which is at least four tales too many in my estimation).Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial , the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings , dazzling colors , sexy showgirls , high - stepping song - and - dance numbers , dream and fantasy sequences , winking character asides , corny dialogue and way - over - the - top comical performances - all pretty much standard - issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days .

Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people . One of them I will name , the other two are mysteries and will remain so . Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV . He is unlucky in life . Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV 's ` no good - dirty - rotten - pig - stealing - great - great - grandfather . ' Those particular exploits cursed the family 's men to many an ill - fated turn . It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV . He has been accused , falsely , of stealing a pair of baseball shoes , freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction , by a famous baseball player . He is given the option of jail , or he can go to a character building camp . ` I 've never been to camp before , ' says Stanley . With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.Camp Green Lake is an odd place , with an odd philosophy , ` If you take a bad boy , make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun , it will turn him into a good boy . ' We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir ( John Voight ) one of the camp 's ` counselors . ' We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man . He at least wears his attitude honestly ; he does n't think he is nice . The camp 's guidance councilor , Mr. Pendanski ( Tim Blake Nelson ) is a different matter entirely . He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor , but he quick , quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges . The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness , but other than that she is a mystery . These three rule Camp Green Lake , a place that has no lake . It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes , five feet deep and five feet wide . Its local fauna , seem only to be the vultures , and dangerous poisonous yellow - spotted lizards . Green Lake seems is , in many ways , a haunted place.Holes works in spite of the strange setting , and the strange story , because it understands people . Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake . The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly . It captures the way boys can bully each other , they way they can win admiration , the way they fight with one another , and the way boys ally themselves along the age line . It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable . What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character . He does not believe in a family curse , he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his ` no good - dirty - rotten - pig - stealing - great - great - grandfather . ' In fact he loves hearing the story . Stanley IV is not bitter about the past , and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather . There is at times a lot of sadness in the film , but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness . And that is refreshing.Holes is an intelligent , insightful and witty family movie . It entertains , and not in any cheap way . It is not a comedy , though it has its laughs . It dares to be compelling , where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional . As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy . I give it a 10 .	1
Wesley Snipes is James Dial , an assassin for hire , agent of the CIA and pure bad - ass special operative . During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.Enter agent Collins , his supervising officer . Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody . Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head - shots outside of courtrooms.The assassination is a big success apart from the fact , that the escape plan blew . So Dial 's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police , whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.Fortunately for Dial the safe - house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day ( Eliza Bennett ) , who loves hanging out with cold - blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement ... With a script like that need I say more ? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes ( be that a pro or a con ) and the movie is quite engaging . On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach .	0
"An obvious b - grade effort to cash in on the Hostel / Saw buzz , my expectations for this film were low ( really low ! ) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level . The acting is so bad it 's not even funny , the plot - line is non - existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it ! I 'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating . I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew . The 34th is possibly the directors mother ? - although I 'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 ! DVD extras include an hour long "" making of "" feature . Which raises the question , "" Why ? "" ( although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do ! ) . Avoid at all costs ."	0
As the film opens , two thugs kill another thug . When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied , the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead , he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague -- a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague ! So , it 's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately , otherwise a disaster could erupt.Oddly , I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague , as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes . The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie . The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really would n't have been allowed to show it . Sure , there is high fever and coughing ( they got this right ) but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood -- along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you 'd get with the Bubonic plague -- all purply and gross ! I can certainly understand why they did n't go this far . Also , I am sure that the federal government would have had a much , much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease -- here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill - prepared and a bit dumb . No one seemed willing to believe the doctors ! ! As for the acting , the film had some excellent actors here . Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are , respectively , the public health doctor and police chief . Good actors but also known actors back in 1950 . However , in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance ( still going by his original moniker , ' Walter Jack Palance ' ) as well as the relatively unknown ( at the time ) Zero Mostel . Palance was great -- very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts . Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work -- a greasy and cowardly sort of evil.Overall , despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly , the film is very tense and has excellent acting -- and is well worth seeing .	1
The movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start - I think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial . But , still , it 's carried out fairly well , and the story & especially the dialogue are interesting . They 've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play . Perhaps it 's a good introduction to Shaw 's plays.The main character Raina has her head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic , and Helena Bonham Carter 's acting does a good job here . Her fiancé , Serges , is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure . Her parents are entertaining enough .	1
For a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull.Nothing much happens and even when things do happen they do n't generate any real excitement or interest.The acting is good from the two leads , Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to.The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it is n't interesting , Succo is not a unique character , he is n't interesting or exciting.Films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it .	0
"I do n't want to go off on a rant here , but ..... this is the worst "" film "" I 've ever seen . Worse than The Avengers . Incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout . Shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion . The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun - Gun . The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful . The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . It 's not even bad enough to be funny . It 's just bad . BTW , the packaging is intentionally misleading.Lion 's Gate owes me $ 4.00 ."	0
... or was Honest Iago actually smirking at the end , as he died?Loved how the Bard 's iambic pentameter just rolled of Fishburne 's tongue , with excellent clarity and emotion.And how Branagh made Honest Iago seem to celebrate his own evilness ... This is a wonderful film.I have often thought that Shakespeare is inherently not film - friendly : He uses words to create pictures in our minds , which creates a perennial battle with the camera , which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel . Every effort to film Shakespeare ought really to be celebrated . It is not an easy thing to do .	1
Cybil Richards directs another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema masterpiece of erotica . This time Jacqualine Lovell ( dressed in rather fetching silver outfit ) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity . However she ca n't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them . The sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack ( at least for this sort of film ) . The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too . Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below . She also fits in a little lesbian activity . To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare . Here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the ' drama ' . Utterly rubbish movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features . Mediocre even for Surrender 's output and clearly a new budget low for them also .	0
Come on ! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys . Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers.I am a HUGE Bollywood fan- but anti - Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay , cinematography , action sequences- everything.I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda , and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say : give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses .	0
Considering it was made on a low budget , THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.The story involves a family who are about to move into their solar - powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California , only to find it trashed -- by motorcycle vandals , they think . But their youngest daughter ( Natasha Ryan ) has begun to see mysterious things -- a green pyramid , strange humanoid figures , etc . And only recently , the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies . Thus the family , led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone , finds themselves face - to - face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time - and - space warp.Mixing in elements of 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , THE DAY TIME ENDED , despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting , remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of David Allen . The desert setting is very appropriate for this film 's close encounters ; and while the movie can not really be compared with either Kubrick 's or Spielberg 's films , THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock - offs . I give credit to director John ' Bud ' Cardos , whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA , for at least trying -- and on that basis , I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10 .	1
I am , as many are , a fan of Tony Scott films . When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like ' Man On Fire ' . To find out that the movie it 's the furthest thing from it ! The story was treading water from the get go , and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea . And the whole ' arm'scene was too gratuitous ! < br />The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly , and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie star ! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.I like Tony Scott 's direction ' n all , but this takes the whole friggin cake ! Sorry Ton , 1 out of 10 !	0
The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang - Soo 's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film , including the multiple connected narratives ( in this case , two ) , and stories of troubled or troubling relationships , as well as a potent dosage of irony.One thing that 's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism . However , this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein . The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends , only to find herself drawn to a stranger , the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes.Again , Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet I do n't think he 's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters , drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony . I think the think I 've come to love about Hong 's films is that they just feel so real , especially the complex and conflicted characters . Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings , but rather , that these characters he and the actors present , feel fully developed and believable.This is not a fast moving film . There 's a lot of lingering and like the previous film , things do n't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways . There does n't appear to be any element of the film that is n't intentionally placed in the film and it 's made my a little hyper - aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses.Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion , regret , longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision - making . It 's a rather hard balance to keep and it 's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row . Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear . This film does n't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does , but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision . Great viewing for art cinema lovers . 8/10 .	1
Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait , I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning . First Pachelbel 's Canon brought a lump to my throat , then the sight of a Tiger Moth ( which my grandfather , my father and I have all flown ) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe 's name hooked me completely . I was entranced by this film , Crowe 's performance ( again ) , the subject matter ( and yes , what a debt we owe ) , how various matters were addressed and dealt with , the flying sequences ( my father flew Avro Ansons , too ) , the story - and , as another contributor pointed out , Crowe 's recitation of High Flight . I wo n't spoil the film for anyone , but , separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles , as an ex - army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot , I admit to crying heartily a couple of times . Buy it , rent it , download it , beg , borrow or steal it - but watch it.PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim ( in yellow training colours)on the ground ? Looked like a twin - engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret .	1
I enjoyed this movie quite a lot . I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it . She portrays a housewife in an African - American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband 's ( Danny Glover ) success as an attorney . She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly , yet a little awkward toward her . The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for SOME laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions . This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama . I give it a strong 8/10 . I highly recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon .	1
No need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here goes the summary : < br /><br / > * Much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous - the colors are superb - would love to have it done in silk as a necktie < br /><br / > * The story and execution is a total snooze - it was quite difficult to stay awake at times < br />If you are a student of the fine arts , medieval calligraphy , early religion and so forth - have at it . This is a FILM for you.If you want an engaging , entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement.Vikings did n't have horns by the way ...	0
This film was pretty good . I am not too big a fan of baseball , but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love , determination , heart , etc.Danny Glover , Joseph Gordon - Levitt , Brenda Fricker , Christopher Lloyd , Tony Danza , and Milton Davis Jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport . The plot was believable , and I love the message . William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.Most sports films revolve around true stories or events , and they often do not work well . But this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale , even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there.10/10	1
"This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures . < br />Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences . Ken , rock n'roll fanatic , marries Kyoto , a Japanese girl , so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires . The marriage is only expected to be temporary , that is , until Kyoto gains legal status again . But , Ken , who seems to be lost in every relationship , takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out . This , despite his friend 's urging that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n ' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that.But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing , and does n't expect to be married to Ken all that long . Not only that , she is homesick and wants to return to Japan . It 's sad in that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that , except the one time he thinks he 's found someone to feel that way about , the girl is n't expecting to stay that long . It 's not that she does n't like Ken , it 's just that she 's used to a whole ' nother way of life . She says , "" I ca n't tell him the way I feel in English , and Ken ca n't tell me the way he feels in Japanese . "" It 's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno - nintendo soundtrack.I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films , Tokyo Pop . And , for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time , check out Tokyo Pop ( a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band ) , except it 's a movie with a happy ending.<br / >"	1
I have watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode , it is that enjoyable . And it is quite scary , but all in good , ghoulish fun . A woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment . Mary Traynor , who I seem to remember from SNL or some other TV comedy skit show , is the evil wife , and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in the dingy Santa outfit . I had forgotten Santa was played by Drake over the years . His Santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times . You can probably guess how Santa finally gets into the house . The episode is played for laughs , but it also can be pretty intense at times .	1
"If you like films about school bullies , brave children , hilarious toddlers and worm eating , then How to Eat Fried Worms will appeal to you.The film is about a boy named Billy , who when arriving on his first day at a new school , discovers that some of his classmates have played a prank on him by putting worms into his lunch . The school bully , Joe and his "" team "" of friends start teasing Billy and calling him "" worm boy"".Billy decides to play along by saying that "" he eats worms all the time "" . Joe and his friends do n't believe him but Billy assures them and bets Joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants.The boys take Billy up on his bet , leaving the weak stomached child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms cooked , fried , or alive.The film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it . For one , it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are . It also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children.The film 's protagonist , Billy is a strong minded and brave person who all of us can relate to . It is easy to empathize with him as we silently cheer for him to reach his goal , even though we might not always agree with what he 's doing or the choices he makes.The children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for that . The child actors are the stars of this show , showing true emotion and feeling than most other children 's movies portray.Some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will , perhaps even teenagers.There are hardly any other good movies on circuit at the moment , so if you 're not in the mood to see snakes on a plane , try worms on a plate in How to Eat Fried Worms . It is a feel good fun film and not just Fear Factor for kids ."	1
"Strangely erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans the world over . Appears to be an interesting take on "" Beauty and the Beast "" . It is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era.Corsets , castles , rutting horses , rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods , proof that no - one had a Brazilian in the 70 's , and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at , what more could you possibly want?!It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon !"	1
Home Room was a great movie if you 've ever had drama in your life . It keeps you wanting to see more . Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding . I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest . Plus I usually do n't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time . I wish I could find more movies like that one . All in All I thought it was a great movie . The more you watch of it the more you become part of it . The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma , because it had her daughter 's name on it . My heart felt as if it had shattered just then . And how her new friend came to comfort her when she had n't gotten hers yet . I loved it so much .	1
No reason to bother renting this flick . From the opening credits on , I knew I was in trouble.It was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie , but there really is n't anything erotic about it . The look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing , but only to a point.Boring sex scenes , bad plot , and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are n't enough to save this film .	0
I started to watch this movie with high expectations . However , after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me . This already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue ? Why is there an Italian comediant present ? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander ? Why did he , upon being saved , not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife ? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would n't be around ? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian ? Why did the Italian comediant know about the Hollanders gold ? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property ? These and many more questions popped up , and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way . So I guess I am totally missing the point of this movie , and I am not connecting to the story in any way ....	0
An Italian / American co - production co - starring Linda Blair and David ' The Hoff ' Hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?Well , based on the uneventful , extremely tedious , and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so , I would have said ' very easily ' ; thankfully , however , things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes , and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy , a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately , my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).The Hoff stars as Gary , a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie ( Leslie Cumming ) to a run - down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project , a book about witches ; whilst there , frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.His plans for nookie are scuppered , however , by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks ( Robert Champagne and Annie Ross ) , their pregnant daughter Jane ( Blair ) , son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland ) , and estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who have come to inspect the island 's hotel.After explaining their unexpected presence on the island , Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property 's new owners , and when a violent storm suddenly picks up , making it perilous to return to the mainland , everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building . Unfortunately , unbeknownst to the hotel 's new guests , the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch ( Hildegard Knef ) , who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life . One by one , victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ) , before meeting a terrible fate.None of this makes much sense , and the acting is atrocious ( Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad , whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers , which speaks volumes about the others ) , but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore : Rose has her lips sewn together , before being roasted alive in a fireplace ; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive ; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish ( ! ! ) ; Freddie 's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood ; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.Oh , and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed ( again ) .	0
T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s , but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not mature with the changing times , styles and fashions . He 's like stuck with the same old - fashioned film - making style.Actors are not bad , not good either . Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son , but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic . Rekha is good , but then - she 's always good , and here she 's nothing more than such . She makes the best of what she is given , but she always does that . In conclusion , nothing great at all . Raveena is OK , which means ordinary , not bad , not good , nothing.This film is melodramatic , occasionally stupid . Maybe it 's a delayed film ? Well , even then it still would be below standard . The script is terrible , the film is overdone , and the story goes nowhere . It feels like a film made in the early 1990s , but the script makes it look even older , the style is like from the 1950s.Don't recommend , unless you 're a big fan one of the starring actors .	0
"This is the first film of the Horrorfest I have watched and after I m almost thinking I do n't need to see any of the others . I was told its a "" thinking mans horror movie "" and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think I shutter to think what the splatter / gore films in the collection will be like . Do n't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through.The plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake . The camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least . Several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of "" The Hamiltons "" . I figured out who Lenny was about half hour in when I figured out the movie . I was so visually under whelmed and confused by the Lenny reveal that I completely felt ripped off . I expected what I got but they could have gone so much further , in fact all the gore falls completely flat . With movies out there like "" Hostel "" and "" Saw "" you need to come a little better for a film that is "" considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences "" ."	0
Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show . Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls , you can tell was created by Bryan Fuller . I can understand how people who do n't have much of a love for theater , cinema , musicals and the like would be annoyed . This is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some . These people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy . This program explodes with color , winks at old movie scenes , hums with incredible music and talented performances . There is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif . The story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love , honesty , courage , loss and so many other things we face every day . The only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled . Do n't approach this as a typical TV show . Think of it as an evening at the theater , then sit back and enjoy !	1
Cameron Grant is one of the best directors doing adult films . His only rival is Andrew Blake . Celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the DR 's office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible . Nearly as good is Asia Carrera 's performance with the construction worker . I highly recommend this movie & gave it a 9 . It 's almost as good as Cameron Grant 's ELEMENTS OF DESIRE which I gave a 10 .	1
"Watching Floored by Love one thought comes almost immediately to mind , "" My god this looks like a really bad sitcom . "" Sure enough , it turns out that FBL is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in Canada , poor poor Canada.Cara ( Shirley Ng ) and Janet ( Natalie Sky ) are a lesbian couple living in Vancouver . Janet has come out to her mother already but Cara 's parents are still in the dark about their daughter 's homosexuality . The pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from Malaysia for her younger brother 's wedding . That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage . With Janet wanting to we d , Cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative Chinese parents that 's she 's gay . Will she ? Would she ? Could she ? Cara 's situation is contrasted with that of Jesse ( Trent Millar ) . Jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen . His biological father Daniel ( Andrew McIlroy ) is coming for a visit soon . His stepfather Norman ( Michael Robinson ) fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by Jesse are harmed by the fact that Daniel is gay and he is not . Will dialing 1 - 800-Makeover help?The dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950 's program along with the overdone physical emoting . The Full House - style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail . McIlroy , Millar & Sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with , it 's no surprise that none impress . It 's possible that the campiness was purposeful . It often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad , that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore . If this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten . The rewrite would focus on Floored by Love being a poor and ineffective send - up of old sitcoms.Writer / director Desiree Lim has put together a by - the - numbers bland - fest that 's entirely forgettable . There was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen . That time is gone . In this day we need quality as well ."	0
This very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget . Dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid , chase scenes are uniformly boring , and most of the on - screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film 's last five minutes ( a briefly glimpsed port - a - potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film 's chief villain -- no prop is here without a purpose ) . The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Corman 's studio when he 'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera -- but without the discipline Corman would impose .	0

Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ai n't never done her no good . Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others . Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city . We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank . The dialogue is quite saucy for it 's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code . Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck 's willing victims . Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red - Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge . An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir . B+	1
"Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel , I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives . The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences , or "" delights "" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me . The plot is n't really worth commenting as , but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory . Before the movie is over , we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out , yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters , yetis ripping a man 's legs off and beating him with them , a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin , a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm , a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man 's shoe , yet then jumps off , and a whole collection of further , bizarre occurrences . Basically , if you are n't staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies , avoid this film like the plague . Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says : "" It 's the best movie I have ever seen . "" To which the friend on my right says : "" Only battle techno music could have made it better . """	0
There 's only one thing I need to say about this movie - the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra 's character about wanting to be a genie ; never see this movie . The story is horrible , the acting is terrible ( c'mon , it 's Shaq ! ) and I 'd rather see Capra in Free Willy ( equally horrible ) twice before ever seeing this movie .	0
"This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I 've ever seen . Closely followed by none other than "" Before Sunset "" , which technically is n't another movie at all , since it 's about the same two people and the same romance.This is "" love "" in the real world . OK , that 's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie . Reading the other reviews , it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog - based movies as well . And this is what makes "" Before Sunrise "" so good . The dialog is perfect . It 's so real , so engaging and funny . It 's hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love , 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop , where they pretend to phone their best friends , with the other pretending to be said best friend . It 's PERFECT . Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.I must say that if you have a choice , do watch "" Before Sunrise "" before watching "" Before Sunset "" . If like me , you watched "" Sunset "" first , it 's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again , the greatest romantic movie in my books . Wonderful acting , excellent script , and beautiful locations . Young love , at it 's best ."	1
A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague.An effective , and classy , little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat . Set and filmed in and around New Orleans , Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine , Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story . It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director . In turn , Richard Widmark { bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire } , Paul Douglas , Jack Palance ( as Walter Jack Palance ) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel , all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic.Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan 's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece . From Widmark 's Public Health doctor , with hypodermic needle in hand , running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good ; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them ; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point . To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema . With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark 's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior.It 's an imaginative and intelligently written story , one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease . A blight on society as it were . It 's noirish elements , such as paranoia , blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being . While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created . Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway , this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end . Not essential film - noir , and maybe not even essential Kazan , but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day . 7.5/10	1
"The movie opens upon Julian Sands , lying on his back , a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it , about two feet above him . That was so provocative , and I thought , "" Here we go ! A good vampire movie ! "" < br />And then it died . That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination . It was slow , uneventful drivel thereafter . I was vastly disappointed , as my previous experience with Sands ' acting was quite enjoyable . However , this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.Even Julian Sands 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.It rates a 1.1/10 from ... the Fiend : ."	0
"I read that "" There 's a Girl in My Soup "" came out during Peter Sellers 's low period . Watching the movie , I 'm not surprised . Almost nothing happens in the movie . Seemingly , the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie ; it does n't . The whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything . Maybe I have n't seen every movie about middle - aged to elderly people trying to be hippies , but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.All in all , both Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better movies than this , so do n't waste your time on this . Pretty worthless ."	0
"I debated as to whether or not I should tick the spoiler box . Since 99 % of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of Scrubs it probably does n't come under the category of a spoiler.Clip shows . Grrr . We all knew Friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows ... and five and a half years into Scrubs they 've gone and fallen down that hole.I have to wonder if the writers just could n't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves "" let 's show the other funny stuff . "" It did n't work.For starters , showing all the times that people have fallen down is n't funny when taken out of context . It 's not funny to see Todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was dangling by his banana hammock.Second , for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD 's fantasies , one was Turk 's dream , another also was n't his fantasy , although I forget which.And that 's the problem . This episode is totally forgettable . We 've seen all these things before . And the collection of clips of people dancing ? Why ? That 's not funny.Finally , I must admit two of my favourite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation ... Dr . Cox realising that Ben died ... and JD telling him how proud of him he is.But even seeing those moments again did n't save the episode . The summary says it all.Worst episode ever . Bill Lawrence , PLEASE do n't let your show go the same way as Friends , keep it fresh , keep it funny ... or wrap it up ."	0
"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I was actually expecting a bad movie but I was caught by surprise believe it or not . The storyline is the traditional , all clichées are included.The dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half - descent actors are trying to make it sound real . The photo is not too good , the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry , the actors are not even trying , altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the "" action "" itself.I do nt understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming , who is financing this shit ? Where is the screening ? And why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script?There are a million hollywood - movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters , but even them Straight To Video things actually manages to look professional in comparison.I can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all , I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life ."	0
Japan is in serious trouble . Demons have infested Edo , taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will . On top of that , the rebirth of Ashura , Queen of the demons , is nigh . The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens , a fearsome group of warriors , who might just be as bad as the demons themselves.Izumo is a retired Demon Warden , who five years ago , took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child ( In a battle that 's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn ) . One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki . Their fortunes intertwine ( literally ) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies.If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic , you 'd be wrong . In fact , there 's nothing typical about Ashura . It is a hodge - podge of many different genre 's of film . Those just mentioned , as well as a comedy , drama , and romance . Director Yojiro Takita ( Onmyoji ) juggles the genre 's fairly respectfully ( Although , the comedy seems forced in some scenes ) and the end result is a ridiculous , but really fun popcorn movie.To be sure , there are flaws in the film . Some of the humor seems contrived , and out of place . And the acting is n't the greatest . But seriously , do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy films for the great acting performances ? ? No , we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals , all of which Ashura has in Spades . Not to be misleading , the film is not all action , but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy.Bottom line ; the films has it 's faults and is not a martial arts epic , but it does n't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action . The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same , their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.My Rating 7 out of 10 . Fun popcorn movie .	1
"I went to see this film with fairly low expectations , figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff . Sadly , it was n't even that . I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out . I went with my two kids ( ages 10 and 13 ) and even they kept asking , "" How much longer ? "" After lasting until the end , I just kept wondering who would approve this script . Even the reliable Fred Willard could n't save the trite dialogue , the state jokes , and the banal plot . I 'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie ( I use the term loosely ) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class . At the least , there are many books on directing , screen writing , and producing movies that would teach them something about structure , plot , dialogue and pacing ."	0
"First , let me say that Notorious is an absolutely charming film , very lovingly rendered of its time and subject(s ) . Gretchen Mol is utterly , painfully convincing , the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by Ms. Page herself . Irving and Paula Klaw are richly drawn as the working - class stiffs they were ( having met Paula at Movie Star News in 1990 I can say that Lili Taylor 's performance is unimpeachable ) , and Jared Harris as John Willie ( Coutts ) is an adoringly debauched genius . Anyone with an interest in the recorded history of American attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie , in a theater preferably , where votes made with dollars count more.Second , I will allow that I am a producer of material similar to that for which the Klaws would become famous , which is no way affects my estimation of Ms. Harron 's work as the splendid piece that it is , but does condition my view of Notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order . Ms. Harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion . Along with V for Vendetta , it is a movie about another time for our times.Few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in Notorious ( through transcription of the very words uttered in closed Senate committee hearings ) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now . While Ms. Harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film , her faithfulness to the facts , and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them , synchronizes Notorious with the present day . The very acts that Notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the Communications Decency Act , recently brought to the Supreme Court as a First Amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the Bush administration . In other words , the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever ( hostile ) jurisdiction they choose . Of course , there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed . Of course you know nothing about it , because you do n't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and can not look at ( likewise , people in Peoria probably do n't want me telling them what they 're allowed to view ) . Of course Notorious will never be indicted . It 's Hollywood . It 's lawyered up . Countless Klaws will , however , continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic , moral or biological composition much in 50 + years.In addition , Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement , which is mandated by the unnoticed "" earmark "" recently voted into law . If any media contains images of "" sadomasochistic restraint "" it is required to make available ( ex warrant ) records of age and circumstance of all performers . Notorious fails in this regard also.In addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an ( nearly ) accurate historical document , Notorious will be the litmus against which the Bush Justice Department is itself judged with respect to the 14th ( Equal Protection ) Amendment and on perhaps several other Constitutional grounds . In this regard alone , a debt of gratitude is owed Mary Harron . You 'll be grateful in any case , Constitutional or otherwise , if you see this film ."	1
the IMDb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain ' spoilers ' . < br />well , this whole film is something of a spoiler ... a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against , a tale of lost youth that does n't know where it itself is going.i just saw this at the tribeca film festival . this film was n't just bad , it was really bad.the acting is inconsistent , the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth , and farnsworth 's acting was very bad in particular.from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place ' graphic ' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios ... it sucked the big one . < br />i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy , updated ' drugstore cowboy ' with a touch of ' natural born killers ' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking ( outside of some frat - level gore ) as the ladder . < br />more than anything , someone needed to really A ) edit the screenplay < br />(there are some things in there to build on and clearly < br />deals with a worthy subject ... if ham - handed in it 's attempt . ) B ) edit the film . if it was cut down to a core , it might be passable . < br />i would go lower than 1 if i could ... like maybe zero kelvin .	0
"I am one of Jehovah 's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility .

"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety , I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike . Is it the worst Western ever ? No , I would n't say that . But "" the last great American Western "" , a phrase I saw applied to it more than once ? Not even close.A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I 've ever seen . The movie can be measured in groaners per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life ? There 's so many instances of this that it 's distracting . Cheesy lines come at you in waves ; predictable , unoriginal , and often . < br />If bad dialogue does n't bother you , then how about bad gunfights ? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously . It 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in Silverado , but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns . The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score , but by then , I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is passable , especially considering what the actors were given to work with . However , if you 're looking for the last great American Western , do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.3 out of 10"	0
"I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons : < br />1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest : "" I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo "" and "" I 'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle 's head in my bed "" < br />2 ) Surprise winners : No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won < br />Last year 's award ceremony was n't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it was n't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better ) but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I 'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers < br />Chris Rock was n't too bad , but he 's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "" minor "" Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There 's no such thing as a "" minor "" Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they 're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it was n't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves < br />Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category < br />Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America 's greatest living character actors < br />Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn < br />Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night < br />Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he 'd never won one . Actually I 'm glad about this because if he did n't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he did n't deserve it for THE AVIATOR < br />Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB 's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off < br />What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they have n't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd 's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts"	0
"Dennis Hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated American actors of our time , and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer . Most movies Hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree , but in this movie , Hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield . Once I got into the plot of the movie , I was hooked , but it 's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film.The concept of the film is great - not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer , but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer . The subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous , but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt.That 's about all that is good you can say about the film . Although Hopper did try to act like a tough , experienced street smart cop , I ca n't help but feel his acting was below par , and there was n't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case . The directing was also terrible - it did n't have the feel of a true film , but rather a TV - movie production . This is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down . When the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion , the acting was weak , predictable and terribly unexciting . That 's when I knew that 1st of all , the action is going to be atrocious.The angling of the camera was amateurish , and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer 's little sister had no true distinctive effect . If it was supposed to be scary , it was n't . Everyone 's acting was terrible , and even for Hopper , I did n't feel for his character , and I just did n't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter.The final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team . Once I saw the swat team in action , I was thinking , finally , something good . But I was wrong . 1st of all , the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys . That is just impossible . 2nd of all , apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their HKA4 submachine guns with one hand . Had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun , these 4 idiots would 've been blown to bits because they were n't even aiming at anything or paying close attention . They should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward , but it just looks like they 're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around . 3rd , SWAT team members do not yell out commands such as "" Keep your eyes open , watch out for yourselves , are we good to go ... etc . "" In reality , they use hand signals or have radios . But they 're literally yelling at each other - how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you 're coming ? ? ? And to top it all off , these guys have no plan - apparently they 're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase . Eventually they end up doing nothing . That was the last straw . I 'm no expert on special forces , but basically what I 've just outlined , is pretty common sense . When the audience knows the movie is terrible , the action pretty much becomes the life - saver of the movie - when you ca n't even make an effort to make the action great , the movie is lost.I give 2 stars for the concept , but the rest can not be credited . If you want to watch a crime thriller , do n't bother with this one . There 's plenty of crime in the movie - but it has the lack of thrill ."	0
This film is like marmite . You either love it or you hate it . If you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values , a good plot and great characters you 'll hate it . If you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you 'll probably hate it.If you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of Harry Russo you will love it . John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane , murderous coke fiend.The special effects are abysmal at best but really , who cares ? If you 're the kind of person who 's prepared to watch a film Schizophreniac : The Whore Mangler you 've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore . With the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would 've mediocre at best . I 'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre.To sum it up , you 'll probably hate this film but if you 're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it 'll become the best thing since sliced bread # 2 I hate marmite .	1
The Sentinel represents everything about the soul - lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days . I can not possibly think of one good thing about it , it 's all so generic , so factory - made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting , undeserving public.A plot about a Secret Service Agent planning to assassinate the Prez could well be entertaining . If handled by a good director or caring cast that is . Douglas is the one who is framed . Basinger is the First Lady , with whom he is having an affair ( an undeveloped , unresolved plot contrivance ) . Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he did n't . And Longoria is nothing . A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and ... that 's it . I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service . As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool , a token and is very badly written.Clark Johnson 's , he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003 , mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV - movie . Douglas , Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone - in their performances from afar . Eva Longoria , the most over - exposed woman of the 21st Century , is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience . Her role is 100 % pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development . She barely has 2 lines to rub together . A truly shameless marketing ploy.If you 're a glutton for punishment then do n't let me stop you . But it IS time and money you wo n't be getting back .	0
This could be a 10 if it was n't for the quite predictable and hollywood - ish scenario . Daniel Day - Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time ( why not THE leading may I ask ) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . I personally was impressed with Hugh O ' Connor who played Christy Brown as a child . The very first scene I watched him was really strong . Wow .	1
Pleasant , diverting and charming . The best part is the swing numbers , especially the rendition of My Buddy , partial though it may have been . The acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by Wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film .	1
"( r#97)There is one good thing about this poor man 's Pokémon ( make of that what you will ) : the opening theme . It has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed Japanese made - for - the - consumers - oops - I - mean - the - young - fans anime TV show . Unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme . And they just could n't come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others ' cards .

Not to mention long - winded ( I realize I 'm being hypocritical here considering the sentence I just wrote).This show goes on forever . I do n't know if there 's any plot , and the static monsters have none of the character of Pokémon . Even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid , this show sucks .

"I 've been reading posts here concerning Wonder Woman 's costume for this TV movie . It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made , she was n't wearing her traditional outfit . The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer 's conception of WW for the early seventies.As for the movie itself , I have to agree with many of the other posters here . Snoozefest ! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974 , so I was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero . Yet I was so "" engrossed "" with the plot , I stopped watching it three quarters into the movie.Of course , I was n't at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee ! :-)"	0
I have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture , i 'm white and like classic rock , however , that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy . Its pretty much a sequel of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie , just about rap instead or rock . Yet it 's hilarious . There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat . The characters are all very funny and believable . I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m. , and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening . One of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different . Rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent . This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit . Overall , it 's a funny movie with many jokes about racism , sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor . This is highly recommend for any fan of This is Spinal Tap . They are essentially the same movie , just about different worlds , and yes , the same jokes work in both movies .	1
The movie had so much potential , but due to 70 's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film . The book version of the film was much better , and well conceived . If it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book , it could have been a very cool classic .	0
"I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill , Jackie Kennedy 's sister and the cousin of these women , would encourage the Maysles ' to make "" Big Edie "" and "" Little Edie "" the subject of a film . They certainly could be considered the "" skeletons "" in the family closet . The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women . I 'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating . ( i.e. "" Are they nuts ? Or am I missing something ? "" ) . This movie is hard to come by . Netflix does not have it . Facets does , though ."	1
I barely remember this show , a little , but I remembered it was great ! My eldest brother , reminded me about the show recently and I had seen an advertisement for the D.V.D set coming out . The network , again screwed up in pulling this from the air , so that they could put what else in it 's place ? It should have gone at least 3 seasons . Why not , right ? I think sometimes that the network executives think they are the ' gods ' of the entertainment world . But they mis - guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time . Let it be said that , they have a lot more flops than ' hits ' . This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line - up . Anyhow , I am getting this for my collection .	1
Part of the enjoyment that I took from this film stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than that it starred John Turturro and Emily Watson ( 2 reasons enough to watch ) , was a period piece and involved chess . Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected . I sha n't , therefore , give away much more . Suffice to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric , obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em matches him step for step as the strong - minded woman who is drawn to him . It 's about love and obsession , rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour , became totally compelling . And I defy anyone to second - guess the ending .	1
"With nothing better to do I decided to check out "" Aztec Rex "" ( as it was being billed ) for the hell of it.The silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing . They actually looked like animatics ( those rough designs that artists later use to finish the CGI effects , adding more details , smoother movements , etc . ) Absolutely awful - looking dinosaurs , which is the only reason you 'd probably want to sit through this anyway.The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl . She kept my interest ; if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used.Disappointing . At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii , where the movie was filmed ."	0
I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while . Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die , Stanley 's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant . It was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died . My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird . Judd Nelson is cute , at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell . Brilliant movie .	1
"You like beautiful girls ? Yeah me too . What is there bad to say about beautiful girls / women ? Nothing imo , so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5 , although it got the "" talents "" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto ? < br />If I really wanted to watch beautiful people , I 'd watch MTV or something that 's why . This is a movie , a so called action movie nevertheless . So by definition it does not even really need a plot right ? I 'm not agreeing 100 % , but let 's say yes to that . So what does it need ? 20 minutes footage from part 1 ( I might be exaggerating a little bit , but it felt like more than 20 minutes ... ) ? ! That would be "" No "" . But then again you never know , the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast , so hey let 's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice ? Just to be sure they wo n't forget ... at least until the credits roll , of course ! ! ! ! < br />So forget about the story , about character development , about real emotions , about the "" acting "" ( and no , I do n't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting ! ) ... what does that leave ? Yes the action scenes . The action scenes are not bad and that 's the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 ! I was giving this movie a chance , but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch , believe me ..."	0
"I 've read most of the comments on this movie . I have seen this movie(and the whole prophecy series ) many times with family members of all ages , we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times . No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts . The movie is just based on biblical facts . I have seen a lot of end time movies "" Tribulation "" , "" Armagedon "" and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths . It may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but I believe it is a good witnessing tool . This movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise.com , and judge for yourself . Blessings to all ."	1
This was on at 2 or so In the morning one Saturday a few years ago , for various reasons I do n't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters . Dom has had a unfortunate lot , manipulated & literally working a rubbish job , Eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling . Tom Hulce ' Dom does n't plead for sympathy - It comes naturally . Ray Liotta Is a universe away from Henry Hill , displaying a soft centre In what must feel a thankless position.In many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carer 's face - the past or the future . As It turns out , with some work the two can happily co - exist . Thoughtfully handled & sensitively played Dominick & Eugene Is difficult not to warm to .	1
An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman . One of the cop ( Périer ) killed her , but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other ( Montand ) . The unlucky Montand does nt know who is the other lover that could have killed her , and Périer does nt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl . Montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great ending ! Highly recommended .	1
"Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland , you have to love "" My Left Foot "" ( and especially Daniel Day - Lewis ' performance in it ) . He plays cerebral palsy - afflicted Christy Brown . Due to this , he has spent most of his life ostracized . Even when trying to warn people about something , they just laugh at him . The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part : his left foot . He uses that appendage to paint and write poetry , bringing him to prominence.Daniel Day - Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration , and also on a later collaboration : "" In the Name of the Father "" ( but "" The Boxer "" was unnecessary ) . "" My Left Foot "" can make you feel many ways : sad , hopeful , or something else . But in any case , Daniel Day - Lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here . A great movie in every sense ."	1
With an absolutely amazing cast and crew , this might have been a classic . Instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted , rather pointlessly , on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960 . Many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach , for instance , or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - John Huston . Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well , in their very different ways , though.The photography is gorgeous , but does not justify an hour and a half of your life , or the price of the DVD purchase .	0
"The movie is an extra - long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure 's spirit . The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.The movie continues throughout to "" Hollywood - ise "" the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold . The movie manages to be predictable throughout , even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.All in all , a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of King Soloman 's Mines and Allan Quatermain ."	0
"I suppose it 's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this . With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films , we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions , foul language , and corny one - liners . Minimalism has its place , and can be very effective when employed properly . However , this film is not one of those cases.Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary , sparse scenery . I 'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight , because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement . The acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history ( at the end of the film , if you can sit through it to the end ) . The scenery is drab , and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled . I would call this anticlimatic , but as the film did n't build to any sort of climax whatsoever ... not even in the "" erotic "" scenes ... it would be untrue . I 'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming , but with the amount of dialogue , I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin . Basically , this film offers nothing to interest or amaze ... no great story , no stunning insights , no visual drama , no excitement . Apart from two or three amusing moments , this film is a waste of two hours . A tragically boring and dreary film ."	0
"One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen , like it 's the case with this movie . "" The Wedding Date "" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake , under the guise of a new story , something that should have been let alone . If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos ' approval , then go all out with big stars and glossy production values , that way , people will come for the stars.Alas , that 's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy . The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London , when basically , this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix . Then there is the problem with the stars . Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney ? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start , the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be . It 's clear that Kat will fall for Nick , and vice - versa in this predictable story . Amy Adams , who was the best asset in "" Junebug "" , comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.For anyone interested , the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes !"	0
I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure . A horrible joke of a film , I cringed throughout . Terrible , trite , distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths.The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film . However , he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused , and also demanded they stop using his name as a source ( it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved).One scene shows Hitler beating his dog . There is not one source for this . Hitler loved animals above people . He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe , banned vivisection and animal experimentation . He was also a vegetarian.The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce , involving bribery . Utter lies . He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time.There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece . Not one.Apart from these , Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick.If he was even half as ignorant , demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed . Never mind become the leader of Germany.Honestly , this film was utterly terrible.Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth .	0
We all know what 's like when we have a bad day at the office , right ? Well , this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it 's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office . Sometimes , it 's just not worth going , know what I mean ? And , sometimes , it 's just not worth doing something when it 's already been done before , in 1970 , with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better also.It 's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec ; quite to the contrary , on both counts . And , it 's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either ; her work has been consistently good , if not great , ever since I first saw her in TV 's Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In of the 1960s.The problem with this movie is that it 's not about the hapless couple at all : it 's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world . That 's if you 're a New Yorker ... Look , the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere , and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment . This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess . For example , not content with the star appeal of the main players , there is a cameo ( relatively long also ) from Rudy Giuliani , then mayor of New York , as we all know . What  Giuliani bucking for President even then ? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.And then we have John Cleese , reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time , as a prancing cross - dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff , sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is , in this role . And , in the process , doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers , arguably the best British comedy series , bar none ... Why was this 1999 movie made ? In the 1970s , New York was a dying city , in many ways . It was almost literally bankrupt . So , when made in 1970 , that was the city you saw : grim , dark , moody , unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke ( as it was then , polluted and all ) . By 1999 , things had gotten better : glitz was back , New York was thriving , it was the Big Apple , ready for you to bite into , if you had the moxie ... So , naturally , the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Hence , this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged . As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy , this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon . If you 've seen the latter , then definitely do n't bother with this one .	0
"Spacecamp is a movie that I plan to show my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan some day . Seeing Joaquin Phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far he s come since playing a Roman Emperor in the film Gladiator . I am pleased to say that I now have comms with the Artificial Intelligence of QE2 who said that I was Young and that is true . Holodeck Comms with my Daughter on Coaltrain came through Coaltrain Gate Julia Ann Glow "" Hide Daddy "" . The fact that my Daughters Artificial Intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan representing Peace to the friendly Ki Alien Creators of humans may not have been taken to a an American Bunker in time . We have the power to change the future with Faster Than Light comms . I order that my Ex Wife and Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan be taken to an American Bunker as soon as possible . My Daughter Julia is 23rd in command of the Planet Earth and a bridge officer . She already said that she does n't like bullies . Having had someone steal her Gameboy and Gauntlet II game from my Mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys . Julia has been growing up fast . The time of JFK and QE2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023 . Julia would be a Young Lady by then and her artificial Intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon . If I have to go to a bunker to continue the American Leadership then I am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority . President Jack Kennedys artificial Intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop Global Warming at any time . Thanks boss that s similar to my Daughter Julias AI telling me hide and stay indoors . Kate Capshaw is now married to Steven Spielberg . Wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses . If you value freedom of speech like President Kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer . Check out Joaquin Phoenixs other movies also ."	1
One of THE comedies of the 1970 's . Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show . The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred . The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing . A man and two women . Richard O ' Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox . Its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success.The scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and Richard 's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm . The end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970 's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements .	1
This is one great movie ! I have played all the Nancy Drew games and have read the books , and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny ! If you never heard of Nancy Drew , read the first book ( Secret of the Old Clock ) so you can kinda ' get used to Nancy , then you can watch the movie , because in the movie , they do n't really introduce the characters ' names fast . ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting . This is an ultimate come - back from the previous Nancy Drew movies , which the Nancy Drew actor did n't seem to match . This movie is much like Alex Rider : Stormbreaker . It 's so cool ! Nancy Drew lovers , you must watch this !	1
Although Super Mario 64 is n't like the rest of the games in the series , it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games . Games with this much replay value are few and far between . Plus , this game has so much variety . There are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do , and many other hidden tasks . The game is n't very challenging , but its lack of challenge does n't take away from the game at all . Once you beat it , you 'll want to erase your game and start again . And its just as much fun the second time , or third time , or two hundredth time . A must own for any Nintendo 64 owner , and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64 .	1
Zero Day leads you to think , even re - think why two boys / young men would do what they did - commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates . It captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own / mutual world via coupled destruction.It is not a perfect movie but given what money / time the filmmaker and actors had - it is a remarkable product . In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide / murderers it is better than ' Elephant ' - in terms of being a film that gets under our ' rationalistic ' skin it is a far , far better film than almost anything you are likely to see . < br />Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty .	1
I did n't enjoy this film . I thought the acting was n't very good and the story was boring . A 20year old computer saving the day ? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched , even for a film . I could n't figure out why they could n't just turn it off , why not take a sledgehammer to it.Its a shame , but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered . This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film , it was n't . If that is what you want to watch , do not watch this film ! < br />Even if the old computer had n't have turned up to save day , this would still , in my opinion , be a very very cheesy flick ..	0
The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon , who I 've had a crush on since 9th grade , which was his first year on SNL . I am a die - hard Yankees fan , and I did n't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes , when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games . I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I would n't have to hear that which must not be heard , but otherwise it was completely bearable.I thought Jimmy played the role very well , because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky , and he is a nervous and quirky guy . I know that it may not be a Academy Award - winning stretch , but the movie is just a light , fun , romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.Jimmy and Drew worked well together , and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past . ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie ? What ? ) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him , and thank goodness , because Taxi could have killed it . I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot . Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . I imagine it must be difficult , and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time ( Tom Hanks , Russell Crowe , etc ) you 'll see that they started off in some flops . Busom Buddies ? Australian soap operas ? Here 's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen . I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do ?	1
Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante 's Broadway show ran for years , but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation , which most likely stems from the choice of director ( Richard Attenborough , as far from B - way as you could get ) and lead actor ( Michael Douglas , who plays a director - choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer ) . The slim story , about a grueling audition for a Broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor - dancer - singers , is pushed right up on us , with loud , brassy talents playing to the rafters . Nothing is modulated or subtle , particularly a laughable subplot about a ex - dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old - flame Douglas . The over - eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache , but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing ; this , matched with Attenborough 's sluggish pacing , spells disaster , and even the now - famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping . * 1/2 from * * * *	0
Although critically maligned , Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen . It 's a movie that should be watched closely ; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them . For instance , keep an eye on Michael Keaton 's use of the pricing gun at the pet store ... and also on the documentary - style years that appear at the beginning of scenes . It 's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly , even though you know it 's a comedy . Amy Heckerling , the director , is really sharp here -- If you enjoyed her better known films ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Clueless , European Vacation , etc . ,)you should give this one a look.Michael Keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast ( Griffin Dunne , Maureen Stapleton , Joe Piscopo , Peter Boyle ) is excellent . Highly recommended .	1
I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre . It was actually sold out . I actually went to see Solaris instead , which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.Victor Rosa ( John Leguizamo ) , a tough , streetwise ' street pharmacist ' , freaks out when he sees a kid get shot , so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack ( Peter Sarsgaard ) . Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish ( Denise Richards ) . This happened very late in the movie , so had they not revealed this in the preview , it might have been an interesting twist . But they did , so it 's not.In fact , there 's not a single interesting thing about this movie ; everything is given away in the preview . If you saw even one preview , you saw the whole movie , so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . Go to the website , download the preview , save yourself $ 3.99 . There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film , other than how terrible the soundtrack is.I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired . Twice . Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets , and ( I may shatter the fabric of the space - time continuum with a concept as mind - numbing as this ) they both had less talent and musical ability.The acting is at best poor , the script is at best a crime against humanity , and Denise Richards is at best 67 % styrofoam and 33 % ziploc bag . You know things are bad when John Leguizamo ( he was in The Pest ! ) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .	0
This film , although not totally bad , should have been filmed where the actual events took place . Grand Island , Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3 , 1980 . Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless , flat Platte River Valley in Hall county . The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non - existant town called Blainsworth . The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie .	0
This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion . From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator , you 'll be entranced . It 's an absolute must - see for anyone interested in criminology . Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great . Not overly done either . I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history , too . How the police work with the political party being what it was ... It is truly fascinating and frustrating . The settings are beautiful . It 's been a while since I saw this movie the first time . It does n't diminish it 's impact . Not overly dramatic or graphic , it leaves enough to the imagination , well , you 'll see .	1
There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer . Suffer they do , in this dreary , truly dreadful film , but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non - dental variety too . If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids , barfing kids , sick kids , lots of long , long meaningful glances , a deadpan wife and a concerned husband : it 's all here for you . Boring , overlong , it stands out as one of those examples that scream out : why ? Is there a saving grace ? Yes , there is . There is a short scene from Nabucco , with some pretty good singing . Save your money , or if it 's on TV or cable , save your time . You can always read a book or make an omelette .	0
"Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly , as well as Kathryn Grayson.The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll 's score , and it garnered nominations for Best Picture , Best Actor for Kelly , and Best Cinematography , as well as a Best Son nomination for "" I Fall in Love Too Easily "" sung by Sinatra.It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself . The lovely Grayson ( The Toast of New Orleans ) dazzled us with her singing , and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra , as well as the artistry of pianist - conductor José Iturbi.A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by ."	1
Annoying , static comedy with a painfully miscast Peter Sellers as a smarmy , self - centered Casanova who always has his way with the ladies . A major blemish on Sellers ' filmography , and , even worse , a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star . ( * )	0
' Iphigenia ' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis . This masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast . Cacoyannis achieved the impossible . He managed to film a Greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance . A stellar greek cast helps him in this . Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia . Equally impressive is Irene Papas , who even though she sometimes seems over the top , it is very realistic . A wonderful Greek film , beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis , with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis which is ideal in every scene.P.S. Rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar by only 1 vote ! ! !	1
"I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film - making be subjected to this mind - boggling failure . Like the "" films "" of Edward Wood , Jr. in the ' 60s and ' 70s , this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts , re - editing their films , and reworking their special effects until they finally look right . This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios ' pre - screening process . If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience , perhaps he would have cut 75 % or the walking / running / strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is "" good enough "" can truly be . Every performance , every line of dialog , every digital effect , every filter effect , indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity . A beginning filmmaker may find himself / herself tempted from time to time to think "" At least I accomplished SOMETHING "" or "" Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself "" . This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment "" the worst movie ever made"".Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are , and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites . Also , beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay , and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story . Writers and directors who watch bad made - for - cable movies of the week and think "" I can do better than THAT "" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results.I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers . Particularly those entering the craft in this current post - Lucas and post - Spielberg environment . There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects . The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off . Some ca n't even come CLOSE to it ."	0
"The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of ' 89 , and again in ' 92 . I believe it made a round on American TV on A&E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90 's but went out of print . A U.S. company released it on DVD later , but that version also sold out . According to the website of the author of the book , the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it wo n't be released again , and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out . I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks . It 's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east , even though the DVD says , "" made in Canada , "" ha ha . But it 's a good copy , and you ca n't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare , out of print , and lost in legal disputes.I love the movie . It 's a period piece set in the 1920 's , with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time . The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark . For the most part , the movie is very low - key , but effective and scary . There is no self indulgent gore , violence or much at all in special effects , but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments . It 's a chilling classic styled ghost movie . The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930 's except for the color . Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies , I 'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem . For me , it places itself as one of my all time favorites ."	1
This particular Joe McDoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star Warner Brothers spectacular Thank Your Lucky Stars , one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period . In that one Eddie Cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who 'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to Cantor.George O'Hanlon who starred in the McDoakes shorts is both himself and McDoakes who 's just trying to get a break in film . Like Thank Your Lucky Stars a few Warner Brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film.O'Hanlon 's been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a World War I film , but lookalike McDoakes gets the message . The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment , he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line . Maybe sounding like a real movie star would help.86 takes later to the exasperation of director Ralph Sanford and the patient Clyde Cook who plays a British cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor McDoakes . It 's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an Oscar to find out what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes.Both of them .	1
"My take on this , at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than I may actually have been , began with a head shake : "" Well , I ca n't summarize the plot , but it 's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man . "" Then , slight embarrassment , I ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down , that is , from whom Trebor unwittingly gets his new heart . It 'd been my last film in a long , long day halfway through the festival . Maybe I 'd dozed . The better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming . Do n't know . Did know there was an O'Henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished . And knew it had to do with the heart , hence the quietly hilarious talent search . My plot - loss remark had more to do with intricacies of Trebor 's connections in France , his relation to the dog woman and so on , stuff I 'd been wide awake for . Denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director 's treatment.But I write these things too often from memory , especially festival films , films whose DVD I do n't have at hand ( Le Lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples . ) , and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions . Still , or already , L'Inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark - side superman , a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible , relatively soft - spoken , driven but patient , right among us . The scar , once he attains it , makes him , just visually I mean , in image , a sort of hybrid Frankenstein monster , mad doctor and creation all in one . The actual doctors are his tools . If he does n't extract and install the heart himself , it 's only because it 's not possible . He 's the force , always , the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself . What else is he ? To suggest that he 's us , the First World versus the Third , seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow First Worlders , on all of us.Denis 's camera 's eye - when it looks at things I know - goes usually where mine would , so I tend to trust her when she looks at things I do n't know . Snow trekking , too - fast bicycling , and forest darkness I 've known in small ways , but the South Seas not at all , so I made better entry into L'Intrus , both France and the crystalline isles of its finish , than into Beau Travail . L'Intrus is , for me , a very comfortable discomforting film . It 's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly , with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we 've seen the reality or not . A single image , Trebor cycling , his massive weight on the thin racing frame , the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires , the asphalt ribbon , the dark - in - bright - sun evergreens , cued me that the film would be linear , a road trip , a single will - driven thrust.Despite Trebor 's personal power , he 's a human failure . No matter who he 's with , he 's alone , though apparently he has n't always been . His body aborts life twice , first to need the new heart , then despite it . L'Intrus is tragedy . Trebor is hubris.I'm navigating perilously the thread of what I remember . Let 's leave it at that ."	1
"Now what 's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap ? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise . John Diehl , does anyone remember him in Miami Vice ? Liked him there ... Well , whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead ? Nothing , and that 's what we get . None of the characters is even likable , the special effects are hilarious ( but not funny ) . The story is a ( very bad ) joke . There is no logic whatsoever for what 's happening . I got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of "" Attack of the killer tomatoes "" kind of thing . Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet ... If you happen to see it on TV , switch channels - your TV set will be ever thankful ."	0
"The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933 , a cutting edge film for it 's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible . Go ahead , take a look at the film , you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 , it was the first true special effects movie . Come 2000 , computer aided special effects seem like child 's play , audiences are not blown away by special effects , instead they are disappointed if they are not done right . The special effects in Hollow Man , the update of the HG Wells story , are OK , but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven , who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientist dabbling in the world of bio - invisibilation ( yeah , I know that 's not a word ) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team 's funding . So , as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do , he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation ( yeah , I know , I used that non - word again ) process . The process has dire consequences , no Caine does not die , but instead becomes a horny , violent creature , aka a guy . Now that he 's invisible , Caine stalks a sexy neighbor , a co - worker , former girlfriend Linda ( Elisabeth Shue ) , and the man who took away his funding . Then a funny thing happens , Caine becomes a new supernatural being , "" The Thing That Wo n't Die . "" Laughing in the face of all things natural , Caine faces down death and spits in it 's face , as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die , dragging the ending of the movie out . The movie is silly , stupid , and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used , sometimes not . There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man , but of course , not one of them is explored . For a more interesting look at an invisible being , get ready for some good old - fashioned black and white cinema , and check out the 1933 Invisible Man . Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back , probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano ."	0
"An hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script . Documentary hits all the beats , plot points , character arcs , seductions , moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in Hollywood;and all the fleeting , fantasy - realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into "" the system . "" Hotz and Rice capture the moment of thinking you 're finally a player , only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind - siding fashion;that for inexplicable reasons , Hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart , your dreams , and your pockets .

"This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80 's hit . It 's set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start.And that 's exactly where the movie jumps the shark . UAV 's are n't armed . They could be but I do n't think it 's ever been tried for real . We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation , called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to "" hacker "" Will Farmer ( he 's good at chemistry & electronics which does n't make him a computer hacker ) & his love interest , Annie ) & Will 's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his IP address is also logged and Annie guessed who it was . We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company.Wills taking money from his neighbours bank account ( Mr Massude ) is n't a hack ( he helped him set up the account ) , we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing Global Thermonuclear War & they play The Dead Code . The trace the RIPLEY office are running is NOT on Will but on Massude 's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against Will.Exactly why RIPLEY shut Will 's machine down is n't explained ( he 's only playing an online game ? ) & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well . Why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable . As for RIPLEY activating his mobile phone ? I think not , it was n't connected to the pc and the message would n't play unless he actually answered the phone so there 's more bad "" hacking "" science there too.RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude 's home , take him away & Will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money . Will searching for the licence plate of the car that took Massude is n't a "" hack "" as you never see him break into the DMV computer . The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis in the airport as he 's looking for Will have no authority to arrest or detain him . Will 's mother had n't "" been stealing chemicals & Bio agents "" either . And even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis . Patriot Act or not.I do n't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the US.The computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against Will , his mother & Dennis was n't sanctioned by a Government agency . The phone phreak we see Will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie , we also get a hack into RIPLEY which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.The "" guy "" who ran into Annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with RIPLEY & the laughable notion that RIPLEY could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the system RIPLEY replaced , the Joshua Project . We discover that the "" guy "" who ran into Annie is Falken ( not played by the original actor sadly ) who faked his own death.We also get to see WOPR as "" what 's going to help "" them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then . Falken & WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all ( the same explosion should kill Will , Annie & the Russian . It 's also unlikely they 'd create a self - contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.The whole "" Decontamination "" plot & idea are totally unbelievable . Those kinds of orders would have to go through the President or Joint Chiefs Of Staff . So yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.The IP hacks against RIPLEY are n't done by Will , he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea . It 's excessively laughable that Will would get a login just from increasing RIPLEY 's operating temperature . Having Joshua as a backdoor into RIPLEY ( especially after it had been blown to bits ) is an incredible cop - out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.There is an awful good where RIPLEY is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown ( saying 17 minutes ) then RIPLEY says "" Decontamination in 30 minutes "" , how crap is that when they ca n't even keep up with their own timer ? RIPLEY 's attack mission against Philadelphia is halted ( far too easily in my opinion ) and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed . The idea of the Nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realise what she 's doing wo n't work ( surely she 'd already know if she had Joshua insider her as he 'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie ? ) is yet another nod back to the original movie.Their cop - out at having RIPLEY repeat Joshua 's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.If you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner . This is an awful movie and is best avoided ."	0
This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone . Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck , who decides money is not enough , so he rents the family who lives where he thought HIS family did . OK ? This is a great little high school soap , PG-13 , but the small sex references are comedy , so if your kid ca n't handle them , they ca n't live in the real world , either.Now , Affleck is a hunk , and as usual walks through this fun , OMG , remember when we did ... , ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease . But that 's OK , because even this old Oracle keeps hoping that if Ben 's that well proportioned all over , well , there 's hope for us ladies yet . Luckily , the rest of the ensemble -- Catharine O'Hara , James Gandolfini , Christina Applegate , Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman -- fill in and keep this shadow - side - Ozzie - and - Harriet Christmas alternately hilarious , comfortable and warm.This movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn , and when you get back , everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed.This is a happy film , after all , and it leaves you feeling good about life , love , family , Christmas and Chanel . There really IS something for everyone .	1
this movie just goes to show that you do nt need big explosions , muti - billion dollar computer graphics , or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie , All you need is a excellent story line and plot . which the master of all japanese films , Akira Kurosawa pulls off brilliantly . I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece . and for those that enjoy Kurosawas earlier works . 10/10	1
This is one very confusing movie . The film is very hard to follow and the plot just did n't seem to make any sense . The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another , it does n't translate exactly as it was first meant . Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film . The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices do n't match the characters very well . The scenes are choppy , there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more . What I did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks . Now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense , they might have had something . Do n't waste your time on this one .	0
OK , the box looks promising . Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting . Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes . Supposed to be a comedy . And I must admit I did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending . This movie has the following elements : A battered and abused next door neighbor , a boring legal trial , racisim , talk of lynchings , and death and arson . Hilarious , huh ? No , please , if you never listen to anyone 's reviews , please do here . You can not even force yourself to watch this crap . CRAP ! I said it , CRAP ! Whoever put there name on this should indeed sue .	0
"I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful . It was slow , pretentious , and boring . I almost fell asleep . There are some decent songs , but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out "" Yaowwww ! "" while someone taps randomly on a wooden object . That being said , there are some pretty songs , but it 's not worth seeing hte movie over . Go on itunes ( they have the album ) , preview it , and choose the good ones . < br />Half the movie is some guy making tea . Well , that 's a slight exaggeration .

If this movie were any worse , it would have been directed by Uwe Boll . This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock . It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile , but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved . How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe . I give it one star because there is not a rating lower . All copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste . No , one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it .	0
"This movie is little more than poorly - made , fetish porn , and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era . This was recommended to me by friend as a "" unique film experience . "" He was right . I suppose he meant that as a joke . Not disgusting , not even that shocking . Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art . A little bit of camp value , though I do n't believe the makers of this film intended this . And yes , as a previous reviewer mentioned , it 's sex with a guy in a bear suit . Do n't spend a lot of money on this . Try to borrow it , if you must see it . Or contact me , I 'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price.I may have to see another of this particular director 's films , as he seems to have a certain following . But if it 's anything like this , I will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever ."	0
Along with Darkwing Duck this is unfairly cancelled . Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track . Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo ( sounds familiar ? ) The theme theme tune is also catchy . Out of all the villains , which are all great on their own merits , Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn . Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the Jungle Book , which is n't a bad thing at all . As a matter of fact , it 's quite inspirational ! The animation was spot on , and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years . PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK ! 9/10 . Bethany Cox	1
Model Chris McCormack ( Margaux Hemingway ) is brutally raped by a teacher ( Chris Sarandon ) of her sister Kathy ( Mariel Hemingway ) . He is brought to trial but goes totally free . He then rapes Kathy!Objectionable and sick rape film . This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape . What it is is a badly written and ( for the most part ) badly acted drama . It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face . To be totally honest however , Hemingway 's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had . The trial scenes were boring and predictable . And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped ( thankfully that was n't shown ) . I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead . But seriously -- having a young girl raped is just revolting.Acting does n't help . For instance , Margaux was no actress . She was certainly a beautiful woman ( and an actual model I believe ) but her acting left a lot to be desired . It lessens the film . Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films . Sarandon does what he can as the rapist . He was n't bad but the terrible script worked against him.I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people . I found this boring , simplistic and REALLY sick . A 1 all the way .	0
"6/10 Acting , not great but some good acting.4/10 Director , makes some stupid decisions for this film.2/10 Writer , story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.4/10 Overall score for this movie.Don't waste your time with this film , it 's not worth it . I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much . Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens "" storywise "" , not in good way . Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes ( too many special effects : slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards ) . It 's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there 's too many tracks in this one . In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics"	0
Whatever happened to British TV drama ? From John Major through Tony Blair , the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women - focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals.(Or perhaps TVNZ does n't buy the good stuff ? Please let that be what it is ... )The writer 's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichés . Niamh Cusack 's performance is strong on meaningful looks , each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve . Baleful looks , however , are a poor substitute for depth of character , if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with . < br />Of course this is theoretically a thriller , about a murder investigation ; but that 's not as important as the central character 's failing marriage and its attendant problems . Is Cusack 's character 's husband a complete bastard ? Will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up ? Making these the central issues is n't a sign of insight -- it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job.Lynda La Plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics ; evidently Paula Milne is n't up to the task .	0
"Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others ? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon - landing with the Titanic sinking and you 've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low - life trash . Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do ? "" I 'll show those old meanies , I 'll put out my own movie and prove that you do n't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money ! "" Yeah , we already know that . The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking . The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane , I 'm running the other way . It 's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids . It 's audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969 ."	0
"What I think I 'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film , "" Phantom Menace "" , is that it will likely blow "" Titanic "" out of the water , if you 'll pardon the pun , when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts , and thereby knock it out of the number one spot . Every time I hear someone declare "" Titanic "" is the greatest film they 've ever seen , I think to myself , "" You do n't see a lot of movies , do you ? "" What a travesty . You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than "" Titanic "" , and for the same price tag.""Well , it won lots of academy awards , lots of people really loved it , "" as someone might say in its defence . Well , lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald 's , but that does n't mean it 's high quality . Yes , millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit , that part of the problem for me was the mega - hype over the film . I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately , it did n't live up to the expectations set upon it , which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story . It 's true , "" Phantom Menace "" will likely suffer a similar fate . but.James Cameron 's "" Titanic "" is . a ) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece . b ) a three - hour epic that has it 's finest moments given away in the trailer . c ) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment . d ) something left better to documentarians , which I would 've enjoyed much more . e ) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship . f ) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back , therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of . When I meet someone who has n't seen it yet , I say , "" I wish I could trade places with you . "" g ) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia . How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences ? h ) thankfully a film that was n't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars . i ) a technological achievement in filmmaking , and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who 'll no doubt come to his defense , and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic 's story , acting or length ."	0
"* * * Possible Spoilers***When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it would be like , not too high , but not low either . This was nothing like I expected at all though , it seems to me like the movie makers could n't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make.In the begining of the film it 's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting , but that 'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I watched further I almost fell asleep a couple of times.The ending is the most ridiculous of all though , almost splatter / comedy ... I'm not saying it does n't have some good scenes it 's just that the film never becomes "" whole"".4/10 Movie - Man"	0
How a director of Altman 's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with , or to care about what happens to , a lead character who is neurotic , a whiner , a jerk with no redeeming qualities -- that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work . A monstrous piece of trash . In addition to this crippling flaw , the plot line requires serious concentration to follow . The setup that the Branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience . This latter issue is at the core of the film : it represents directorial self - indulgence with profound contempt for the taste , values , and intelligence of the viewer . Very unusual for Mr. Altman.Patrick Watson	0

This is an excellent film , and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings , as it is unavailable on video / DVD . The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving , and ends with them leaving ( although quite a lot happens in between , and they do n't stay in one place during this time ) , gives you a sense of closure , and a feeling that all is right with the world . If you get a chance to see this film , then do . I ca n't wait to see it again , and wish that it could be put on general release .	1
"Alexandr "" Sascha "" Luzhin ( John Turturro ) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an Italy - hosted tournament . His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life . Natalia ( Emily Watson ) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother , Vera ( Geraldine James ) to scope out possible marriage partners . Vera leans toward a handsome count but , astonishingly , Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha , whom she met on a walk . Sascha , too , is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting . But , with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess matches and , with other happenings in his past still causing problems , will he win the heart of Natalia ? Oh , and can he become the chess champion , also ? This is a lovely film , based on a novel by Nabokov . The acting is amazing , with Watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro utter perfection as the shy , awkward chess enthusiast . James gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well . As for the look of the film , it could not be better . The scenery is of the put - your - eye - out variety , the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause . Yes , the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks , at times , making it a film not everyone will appreciate . Then , too , the ending is bittersweet . However , if you love romance , period pieces , great acting , knockout scenery , or the fine art of motion picture creation , do n't miss this one . You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms ."	1
This movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks I 've seen . The length was n't nearly long enough to include a good storyline . Also , the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous . The mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure , and the dad is shot by a police officer ? I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for , but it could have been better . Also , the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over . After hearing all of Lucy 's name and figuring out it was ' Lucifer ' , I wanted to gag . Yes , it 's interesting that Lucifer was a woman , but look at the name . It 's a male 's name . It should be given to a male character . All in all , the movie was a bore , and could have used a better plot .	0
This documentary was very thorough and exposing , and at the same time entertaining , which I thought was rather impressive . I felt as if they did a very good job covering the sport from its ' origin until present day , but nonetheless , there is a reason why I do not give such a high score to this film ... I felt as if at times the story focused too much on the ' proper nouns ' of the sport , so to speak : too much on individual locations at which to surf , and especially too much on individual surfers . I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport , the ideology of the sport , etc . it would have been better ( although this of course was covered , I do not think it got as much time as it warranted ) . < br />And for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing , at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring . Although the video clips and the in - depth research is well - respected , it could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers.Furthermore , my biggest disappointment was at times they spoke of how utterly amazing and miraculous certain events in surfing history were yet they did not have the actual footage of these events unfolding , and the whole time you are waiting to see on the silver screen this amazing , breath - taking event that these men are talking about as life - changing moments , and in the end all you get is a lot of men talking about it , and not the actual footage . It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories , and then be unable to see them . I understand the difficulty of obtaining footage of everything , but please : do not brag an event up so much , and then not show it . < br />Overall , a very fresh documentary that I enjoyed watching ; not the best documentary due to the above reasons , but being very fresh and having some extremely exciting footage and a good soundtrack , it is a documentary that I would advise everybody to check out .	1
"First of all , DO NOT call this a remake of the ' 63 film . Even though this version is truer to the stage play , it is Extremely long . The casting was good with some exceptions . Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice . She was almost 30 when she did this film , and it was hard to believe she was a teenager . Jason Alexander was good choice , but after a while he gave me a headache . Tyne Daly overdoes her part as Mae Peterson . George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee , and showed he could even hold a tune . Like the ' 63 film , they casted an unknown to play Conrad Birdie . Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and it showed . I even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing . So what made this a TV ratings flop ? It was lengthy for one . They put in new songs and scenes . Even though some of the new songs were good ( like "" Let 's Settle Down "" ) , was it really necessary ? Now do n't get me wrong , I liked it , but I rather watch the ' 63 film ( see my review ) . This was just a case of some actors overdoing roles , making some changes , and once again , LENGTH . One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams . She does a good job with the role and the music . Give her any lyrics and she could sing them . So here is my advice coming from someone who 's done a couple productions of Bye Bye Birdie : If you want to watch an entertaining take on the play , watch the ' 63 film . If you want to watch a version that is truer to the play , watch the ' 95 version . Just take it in moderation though . Do n't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting ."	1
This film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly , just painfully mediocre . Lacking any real wit or imagination , a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the ` jokes ' ( which are predictable and threadbare ) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer . Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what ` shocked ' or amused us 30 years ago does n't work quite the same way now . We 've seen it all before , and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated . A major miss .	0
"I was so impressed with Doug McGrath 's film version of the Jane Austen novel "" Emma , "" and I loved the music score by Rachel Portman so much , that when I went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re - united for "" Nicholas Nickleby "" I immediately rented it without any other consideration.I have read the book , and for those overly - critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation , I do n't know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austen 's work , especially given the limitations of a two hour movie ( which some have complained about being too long ! ) . And as far as Gwen Paltrow 's accent is concerned , I must confess I was n't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially , and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside . The film 's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker , then perhaps you should rent something like "" Death Wish III!""The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast , and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex , violence or even a villainous antagonist . The story is often amusing , endearing , and at times , quite touching.I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite ."	1
If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects I recommend you take a look at this film . Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular , all the actors in this film give really great performances . If you 've got about eleven bucks ( that is close to nine quid ) I say order it online , or rent it from you favorite movie rental place . Guaranteed to make you laugh , whether or not you normally like gangster type movies . Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you never forget , and find yourself watching over and over . You will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it .	1
I admit I had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece . It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all I knew . It began with great visuals , little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild . As it continued I learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place . A nice little neo noir story that I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time . The little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot . Along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall . The score , though not bad , gave the film almost a music video feel . It just felt a little dated , not adding anything to further the storyline . Some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece . I walk away from this very satisfied . I was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice - over work it did n't feel rushed or pushed . Great job !	1
"This is an unusual Laurel & Hardy comedy with something of a split personality : at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short . Happily , each portion is funny in its own right , and the boys ' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film 's disparate elements into an entertaining whole . While I 've never heard a fan cite DIRTY WORK as his or her favorite Laurel & Hardy comedy , it 's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like.Our story is set in the home of Professor Noodle , who represents one key element of the story - line : a wildly over - the - top parody of Mad Scientist scenarios . This marks a rare venture into sci - fi territory for L&H ; Abbott & Costello and The Three Stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than Stan & Ollie . In any event , the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger , while his sarcastic butler , Jessup , expresses the viewer 's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip . Meanwhile , Stan & Ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the Professor 's home the very day he perfects his solution . "" Their "" portion of the film consists of characteristic ( but first - rate ) slapstick involving the chimney , the roof , shovels , and a number of unfortunate mishaps . If you do n't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably wo n't like DIRTY WORK , but for fans of the team this movie is a feast . The highlight comes when Ollie plummets through the chimney , lands in the fireplace , and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision , one by one . I also like the shot of Ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse ; the process work is so slapdash I suspect it was something of an inside joke , the way W.C. Fields ' movies would feature the world 's worst rear - projection screens.The slapstick stuff is great fun , but it 's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat , and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat : prolific character actor Lucien Littlefield is terrific as the professor , delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee , while Sam Adams is a stitch in the less showy role of Jessup the butler . As great as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were in their prime , it 's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the Hal Roach Studio gave their films an enormous boost . So too , usually , did the background music of Le Roy Shield , but DIRTY WORK marks a rare occasion from this period that a Roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits . Mood music might have enhanced the proceedings , but no matter ; this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow , and a prime example of what made Laurel & Hardy so popular in their day ."	1
"Eric Clapton , Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re - unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "" Cream . "" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it : all skinny , very long hair , wild clothes and loud music . They played a combination of rock and blues and it was , for the most part , good stuff.Well , these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us . I was always extremely familiar with Clapton , of course , who has never been out of the limelight , but I did n't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker , neither of whom I had n't seen in decades . They surprised me . When he was young , Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death . Now he looks healthy , in shape and his drum playing was solid . Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great , as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs . This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they 're doing.Some people criticized this show for being low - key . I do n't agree with that . I have no complaints . The concert sounded very good . The second song , "" Spoonful , "" was outstanding , the highlight of the concert for me.Highly recommended ."	1
"This movie is bizarre . Better put , it 's "" freakin ' weird "" . I could give you a plot summary , or some hoity toity analysis , but I would consider it a waste of your time . All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters , one incestuous relationship , homicide , post mortem mutilation , and one really disturbing infatuation . At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself , but not in a good way like after "" Pulp Fiction "" or "" Fight Club "" . It 's like you 're a teenager ( or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you A : wish you had n't done , and B : hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about . And nobody likes that . My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth , just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch "" Kazaam""(yes , I would rather watch "" Kazaam "" than "" Murderous Maids "" , read into it what you want ) ."	0
"Was this movie stupid ? Yup . Did this movie depth ? Nope . Character development ? Nope . Plot twists ? Nope . This was simply a movie about a highly - fictionalized Springer show . It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV . Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly 's mom . Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS ! This flick was n't so much made to be a "" breakthrough "" movie , rather , it was intended to life in a trailer park ( I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie ) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all the girls get pregnant by different guys , and all the guys drive rusted - out ' 66 Ford pickups ( exaggeration , of course , but that 's the picture everyone sees when you mention "" trailer park "" ) . Some people over - analyze movies ( case - in - point : Star Trek freaks ) . I watch movies purely for the entertainment value ; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene ( read the "" Goofs "" bit about Connie 's shirt . Could it have been better ? Sure . But it was funny as hell ."	0
"For this review , a list of good points and bad points . I'll start with the bad.Bad points : The casting choices(especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg),the acting of said badly chosen cast , the storyline , the idea of setting the film in the modern day , the direction , the editing , the soundtrack , and above all , the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that was n't that great to start with , despite it 's popularity.Good points : Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that 's it!One might make an analogy here . In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke struts her way up to Michael Weston as Enos , and asks the question,""Enos , where 's Boss Hogg and Roscoe?"",in his clouded judgment , tells her where they are . She might just as well have asked,""Enos , is this a good movie?"",the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes , even though in his right mind he would have said,""No , not really . ""As good as she looked in the bikini , she could have been stark naked , and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film - making . Stay out of Hazzard !"	0
"Everyone involved ( and the audience ) should seek out "" The Candidate "" to see how good this movie could have been . What happened the South American story ? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut - outs . Up to now I have liked every Gene Hackman performance and/or movie . He was either disinterested ( which I can hardly believe ) or dreadfully miscast . I have also liked and defended Richard Gere ( and been vilified for it ) . But here he had no "" power "" . He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive . All in all I was very disappointed . I really expected much more from this director and cast . If you ca n't find "" The Candidate "" watch "" Wag the dog "" again or even "" Bulworth "" ."	0
"I am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first . And from that perspective I can honestly say that while enjoyable , I can see why it has n't been rebroadcast anytime recently . More specifically , this mini has some serious problems , such as:1 ) It is terribly miscast . The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters . Ali McGraw ( 45 at the time ) was playing Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 . Jan - Michael Vincent ( 39 at the time ) was playing Byron Henry who was supposed to be about 22 . The other Henry children , and Pamela Tudsbury , were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.2 ) Some of the acting was absolutely awful . Ali McGraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable . I have seen more convincing performances in high school plays . < br />3 ) The directing was poor . To be fair to Ali McGraw , the bad acting and character development were probably the directing . The portrayal of Hitler was way overdone . His character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic , sometimes charming , but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel . Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically ( Berel Jastrow ) they do not gain the depth of character that Wouk created for them.4 ) This mini is very dated . The hokey music , the pretentious narration ( it sounded like a junior high school history film narration ) , and the entire prime - time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times . Also , too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.Someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all , because it will come off more as a late 70 's / early 80 's "" take myself too seriously "" prime - time soap drama , rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic.Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done , but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning , memorable , and critically acclaimed production . I do n't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long ( 15 hours ) or longer to do it right , and given the short attention span of most of the current American viewing public , it would n't fly ."	0
"The only reason that I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus , extras , etc . However , if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life , this film is for you . If you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you . This is one of the most life - affirming films that I have ever seen . And magical . The acting is superb , the plot serves the purpose , and the opening sequence is fantastic . This is one of those films that "" cult "" status used to be about . I have recommended this film to all of my friends . Some love it , some ca n't finish it . Whenever I think , or feel , that something is impossible I think about Alan Arkin 's role in this film . Sure wish he 'd make more films ."	1
"Eddie Murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this HBO stand up comedy show . I love his impressions of Mr. T , Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "" The Honeymooners"",Elvis Presley , and Michael Jackson too . The Ice Cream Man , Goony Goo Goo , is also funny . I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.I laughed so hard , I almost fell off my chair . I still think this is very funny.Eddie Murphy , when he was on "" Saturday Night Live"",made me laugh so hard , he is one of the best people to come out of""Saturday Night Live"" . ""Eddie Murphy Delirious""is his best stand up performance next to "" Eddie Murphy Raw"".I give "" Eddie Murphy Delirious "" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars ."	1
"When you put this DVD into your player and hit "" play , "" you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc . CHERISH THIS MOMENT . Make sure you have some Tylenol or something ( preferably PM 's so you can fall asleep ) , because you 're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts.Starring a bunch of big - breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit , I thought I 'd be in for a good time . Sure , the opening sequence was a WEE bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a Scream ripoff ( by the way , my sole chuckle was from Julie Strain 's final comment in this scene ) . But then I knew there was trouble ... the opening sequence had a terrible rock song . During this terrible rock song , I looked over the DVD Chapter titles and saw things that said "" TOPLESS IN THE BACKYARD ! "" and "" BETTER THAN SEX ! "" . I knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be.And that 's the sad truth : The ONLY good thing about this movie is the attractive cast . Other than that , it 's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an "" innovative "" concept about murder clubs , which ends up being fake anyway . So , the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery , but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you do n't care for any of the characters . I mean , when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman , can you really feel ANY sympathy towards her when she 's in fear for her life ? The Scream influence is prevalent throughout , with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes . We 're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad ( Lloyd Kaufman ! The only other cool part of the movie ! ) about an abortion or something . Uh . Yeah ... This is n't a "" so - bad - it's - good "" movie , it 's just BAD.Someone compared this to a Troma film , but ... you know , most any film that comes from Full Moon ( or its offshoot , as this film proves ) is horrible . NOT horrible in a Troma sense -- I 've seen many Troma films , and I can honestly say they all offer something , ANYTHING that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later . However , this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it . Beware ."	0
"The "" Trivia "" page on IMDb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re - cut by the studio to "" simplify the plot "" . If so , that effort was a total failure , as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I 've ever seen in a film -- I 'd hate to have seen it before the plot was "" simplified . ""It 's sad to see Warren with so little character to go on that even he ca n't do anything with the inept material . It 's interesting to see Caron in ' 70s mode instead of her Hollywood - era glamour garb and persona , but it 's sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing - a- favor - to - her - producer - husband dreck . She would actually later hook up with and marry the director , instead -- who , you 'll note , never directed anything again , but did strictly 1st or 2nd A.D. work in TV from here on out . That oughta tell you enough right there.I call this "" interesting "" because I have an automatic fondness for American films of this period , and this role does add perspective to Oates ' otherwise fantastic 1971 output ( Two- Lane Blacktop , The Hired Hand ) . But the "" 1940s detective as fish - out - of - water in 1970s L.A. "" theme , which is the only thing the movie really has to say , is sold in way too heavy- handed a manner . A similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in Altman 's The Long Goodbye . And as far as Oates playing a hard - bitten guy on a doomed errand , three years on , he would give his definitive performance in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia . If you have n't seen those , do n't waste your time with this !"	0
"We bought the DVD set of "" Es war einmal das Leben "" ( German ) / "" Once Upon a Time ... Life "" ( English ) for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the "" Es war einmal der Mensch "" ( German ) / "" Once Upon a Time ... Man "" ( English ) series ( us parents had seen it as kids ) and it has exceeded even high expectations ! The series is very well made , does not show its age , and our kids at various ages really like to watch it . At the same time , they learn things us parents did n't know until way , way later . The series covers everything to do with the human body from organs , all senses , blood , infection , antibodies , and much more in animated 20 - 25 min episodes . Topics some people may find "" sensible "" , such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful , discreet and child - friendly manner ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing ) , while still ( as typical ) informative and fun.Children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment . The format of the episodes switches between the outside world ( a family with 2 children ) and the inside of the body . For example , in the episode covering infections , the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this . Similarly , the episodes on the senses , e.g. hearing , seeing , link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including ( briefly ) where the oxygen comes from ( plants).This is one of the best ever children 's programs - I would say it 's a must see for every family with kids !"	1
An absolutely wretched waste of film ! ! Nothing ever happens . No ghosts , hardly any train , no mystery , no interest . The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful . Everything else is pathetic . The premise is idiotic : a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no - place , because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes . What ? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay , in a heavy storm ? I think not . Oh , they can walk 4 miles across the dead - black fields . umm , yeah . Sure . Or , they can force themselves on the railroad 's hospitality , and stay at the ' haunted ' train station . A station which proved to be nothing but DEADLY BORING , utterly without ghosts , interest , or plot.So very terribly dull that this seems impossible.This ought to be added to the LOST FILMS list ! ! aargh ! !	0
I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film . Story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . But , then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed . Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . The narrator ( Max Von Sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945 . We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow - moving moment that leads you to death . Unlike many films it does n't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . Enjoy it !	1
"Believe me , I wanted to like "" Spirit "" . The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old - fashioned , hand - drawn animation again , as if the last pencil - animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago , and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete , had got my blood up ... but then , the insulting , flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "" Spirit "" got my blood up even more.The character designs are generic , the animation ( partly as a result ) merely competent , the art direction as a whole so utterly , boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about ( we know , from "" The Prince of Egypt "" and "" The Road to El - Dorado "" , that there are talented artists at Dreamworks ) , and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill - judged . ( Why do they bother ? ) There 's not a single thing worth LOOKING at . In an animated cartoon , this is fatal.But it gets worse ... The horses ca n't talk , but they 're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in "" Bambi "" , which can . And it seems that , in a way , the horses CAN talk . Spirit himself delivers the prologue ( sounding for all the world like a 21st - Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California ) , and from then on his laid - back , decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack , although it never once tells us anything that we did n't already know , or expresses a feeling which the artwork , poor though it is , was n't capable of expressing twice as well . That prologue , by the way : ( a ) contains information which Spirit , we later discover , had know way of knowing ; ( b ) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk ; ( c ) includes new age rubbish like , "" This story may not be true , but it 's what I remember "" ; and ( d ) will give countless children ( the production is pitched , I presume , at six - year - olds ) the impression that horses are native to North America , which is sort of true , in that the common ancestor of domestic horses , zebras etc . WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived , and the mustangs of Spirit 's herd ( which allegedly "" belong here like the buffalo grass "" ) were descended from horses introduced by Europeans.So the prologue rather annoyed me.As often as Spirit talks , Bryan Adams sings , sounding as usual as though he 's got a bad throat infection - and it 's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings , it 's WHAT he sings : maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less , if possible , than Spirit 's spoken narrative , and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune ( although I was paying close attention , and was able to discern that they probably did n't ) . If only Bryan Adams and the guy - pretending - to - be - a - horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two , the movie might have been allowed to take its true form : mediocre and derivative , rather than jaw - droppingly bad ."	0
My husband and I went to see this movie , being the horror movie buffs that we are . Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back . I was so disappointed . The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film . There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances , etc . I found most of the ' scary ' parts to be more comical than anything . After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers , I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US . My advice : If you are a fan of true horror movies , save yourself the pain of sitting through this one . I ca n't really say that I would recommend renting it either , unless you have a free rental coming to you .	0
"Yokai Monsters : Spook Warfare ( Yokai daisenso , 2005 ) a movie about "" yokai "" or traditional Japanese "" monsters "" of folklore . It is alternatively known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade.The yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak , kappa water imp , a living ' brella , a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic , a woman with a second face on the back of her head , a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd - like wrist , & so on.These sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore , but from a type of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa Era , comparable to today 's Halloween haunted houses , or the "" freak shows "" of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks . Ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one - headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "" chills "" during the hot summers . The fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions , based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls ; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky , this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills.These rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient Babylonian vampire demon who has come to Japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord . Despite that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy , & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak , it is all played very poker - faced & is very charming . It has some beautiful cinematography , much as would be provided in a CGI film of the same decade . Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends , it is exciting , moving & touching.Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famed Lone Wolf & Cub : White Heaven & Hell ( 1974 ) & and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy . The Yokai Monsters series is not the equal of Majin at its best , but the Yokai are nevertheless great fun . The first miike movie which is the most child - oriented of his family films , with the GOZU & IZOO consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers ."	1
Well , AWFUL is just the first name . This movie is a cliché - ridden piece of junk . A high school comedy setup in a military training camp . I 'm sorry I had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve.THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:Just about everything is totally forced , unconvincing and unrealistic . The HEPO ( military police ) will not come to get you if you do n't make your appearance , especially not on your wedding day . The actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene , because the scene did n't work as it was so highly unlikely . You can sense it in their voices . Even if they were not such bad actors , they would n't have been able to save the scene . < br />Next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit . No , there was no time to get him an uniform first . Man , this is great cinematography ! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life.There are also GIRLS in the camp -- exciting -- one of'em even a model , though not looking that great -- and the baddest actress I 've ever seen . I doubt in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie . < br />Okay girls in the military ! Now this is getting fun . The girls are even placed on the same floor , so we can sneak to their room at night ! In reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away , separated by two fences with barbed wire . < br />There are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time , of which we have plenty . No , the tanks are not locked , and the ignition keys are inserted . No one will notice the engine sounds , especially not at night.There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line . We need those so the sexually obsessed Germans will like the movie as well . Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film . Well done!One sex scene takes place in the kitchen . Surely , none of those facilities are ever locked . The military routines are as sloppy as they can get.In the end of the brainless flick , the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him ! Because he deserted his fiancée ! Sure I buy that , the Italians are that way -- a jealous bunch ( not ) . < br />The bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses . Not at night in a dark alley . Again , military training grounds ( where there is shooting with live ammo ) are open to the public , anyone can freely drive or walk in there . There are no such things as guards or fences . < br />The deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the Italians ' car . The explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiancée off their feet . No one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens . It 's a COMEDY , remember.Okay . It 's a comedy , I got that , and I can live with that . No realism needed . Filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously , side splitting funny , or entertaining , interesting , challenging . Unfortunately it is none of those . It 's just embarrassing . A rip - off from brainless American comedies . The latter are at least done professionally , with no amateur actors.It is pretty boring and predictable , a waste of time and energy , especially to those sitting through the entire movie as I unfortunately did . Yawn .	0
In the film Kongwon - do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness ( as well as general meaninglessness ) into the lives of various Koreans ; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves , enjoying the escapism of nature . From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters ; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires , the overall complexity captured within human life ( and yet the overal simplicity of humanity ) . Although the film is slow - moving , it can be very contemplative . It does not force any ideas , but allows the ideas to come about themselves , it allows the concepts to reveal themselves.The film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins , and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness , that love is often an act of selfishness , and the many mistakes that we make . It is a look into everyday life , very well and beautifully done.If you are looking for action or for intense drama , this is not the film for you . However , if you enjoy honest , original , and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz , this is a great film to watch .	1
how can this movie have a 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk s**t . first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw Charlie was so retarded . because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut ( that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick ( that really cheap as * flimsy piece of wood ) and he did not even think he could cut threw it)second the person who did the set sucks as * at supplying things for them to build with . the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t.v . show . bottom line DO NOT waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s**t they call a movie.rating:0.3	0
John Pressman ( Micheal ' I shoulda called Ditech ' Lerner ) works at a doctor 's office as an orderly . His mother ( Zelda ' Poltergeist ' Rubenstein ) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him . But this turns out to be a movie within a movie , but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill . Prompting a guy who 's watching the movie to do the same . Lerner is suitably over the top in this , but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again . That gets annoying fast . But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie . As a horror film this one fails , it 's too busy trying to be clever , trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension , or at least a jump or two . No , what we have here is the worst kind of slasher : An art - house one.My Grade : D+	0
I highly recommend this film . Set in the Bladerunner - esquire future of 2054 Paris , it is in most respect a classic film noir script : lady in peril , sister trying to find her , honest cop fighting everyone . Luckily , it avoids being stereotypical , and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting , innovative visuals . The film might remind you of Sin City in look , but it has an even sharper , even more graphic novel look that I found really compelling . Each frame , each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer . In terms of story and artwork , you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties ( or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer ) and movies like Casablanca , as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations . Make any excuse you need to see this film .	1
"To watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith , as one has to keep saying to oneself , "" it 's old "" , "" it 's a classic "" , "" be kind "" , not because the movie is so bad , but because at its best it 's so good . This is one dated movie . It 's also a classic , if a tarnished one . I 'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway , on principle , and I get more than a little irritated when others do so . To make fun of The Informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth . Yes , one says to oneself , he is an idiot , and yet when he 's on top of his game he is also a true savant . The same is true for The Informer , which is on occasion very dreadful indeed , and yet it boasts splendid photography , some fine acting , a wonderful score and a good , decent simple story . In the end , which I wo n't give away , politics , religion and psychology come together , in a church , in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top , and yet so is life sometimes . Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us ( presumably brilliant ) modern folks , and the scene is n't so much unbelievable ( I buy it , but I know the Irish ) as embarrassing . Yet people do behave that way , they do say things like that . Not everyone is hip , and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip . Are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago ? And in what way ? I do n't think so . We 're just different . Now go watch the movie ."	1
Road to Perdition , a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes ( and in my opinion his best work ) , a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty . This is a terrific movie , and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.It 's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the , Michael Sullivan , a father of two children , played by great Tom Hanks ( I 'm not his admirer but ought to say that ) is a hit - man for local mafia boss , played by Paul Newman . His eldest son , a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr. , perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin , after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live . Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder , committed by John Rooney , son of his father boss . Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever . The atmosphere of the period , all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created , editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written . But the main line of the movie , the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father - son relations in bad times . They are shown so deeply , strong and believable . Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb . Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful ( but one more time sad ) masterpiece . I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film - making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.My grade 10 out of 10	1
If you want to see a retarded homosexual Karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe Mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr , then this is the film for you . if not then choose another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs . the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end . The cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap , b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g 's and a key , bloody streetz and menace . I would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot , editing and acting really do n't matter to you . it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity ! ! !	0
"Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971 . Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu , the capital of Nepal , the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family , but also a relationship between a brother and a sister , as well as drugs and the hippie movement , which made many people think that it involved the ISKON - the movement for Krishna consciousness.The movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator 's sister . Going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing . This soon leads to a split in the family . The brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father.As years pass , the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to Nepal . Here , Prashant , the brother not only finds love , but he also finds his sister , Janice . But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past . With help of Shanti , his love , the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles , including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself , Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman ( her first movie ) , Mumtaz , Rajendranath , Prem Chopra , Jnr Mehmood , A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev . The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman , whose last score was "" 1942 - A Love Story . "" During the filming , Dev Anand asked Panchamda ( R.D. Burman ) to compose something special for this film . Days later Panchamda came back with the composition of "" Dum Maro Dum . "" The song was an instant hit ."	1
""" Pushing Daisies "" for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years , agree you with that or not . Bryan Fuller , the creator , has an amazing creative mind . He 's the mind behind other great TV Shows as "" Dead Like Me "" ( 2003 ) , "" Wonderfalls "" ( 2004 ) , and the other one not as great as these ones , but also interesting , "" Heroes "" ( 2006 ) . It 's a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows , mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings , something that a fairytale always is . So , being a kind of fairytale , you can not expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations , or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told.A gift always comes with a curse , and what is sweet can also be bitter . That 's so , Ned ( Lee Pace ) , The Piemaker , is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef : he can give life to the dead with just a touch . This could be a power that everybody would die - or live - for if was n't for another simple and very sad thing : he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again . The curse of this amazing gift does n't stops there ... everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute , another specie of that one would die instantly . He 's a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively , always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love . Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love , Chuck ( Anna Friel ) , if was n't for another sad fact : she was dead . He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does , but this love is untouchable . The truly kiss of death . And that 's how this beautiful modern fairytale starts.When I heard about "" Pushing Daisies "" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar ( or maybe some kind of tribute ) to everything that Tim Burton has created since "" Pee - Wee 's Big Adventure "" ( 1985 ) to "" Big Fish "" ( 2003 ) and "" Charlie And The Cholate Factory "" ( 2005 ) . The results could not be better . The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent . The stories around Ned and Detective Cod ( Chi McBride ) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in TV , but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as Chuck and Olive ( Kristin Chenoweth ) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors . Not only that , you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters , even those ones with the most deep dark humors.Forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes , the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things . The actors here are top of note . Lee Pace is tender , soft and contained as the character asks for . Anna Friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be . But the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as Chi McBride ( Detective Emmerson Cod ) , Swoozie Kurtz ( as Lilly Charles ) , Ellen Greene ( as Vivian Charles ) and Kristin Chenoweth ( as Olive Snook ) . Swoozie Kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown , for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing . But if the best dialogs are given by Swoozie and her character , the best funny moments are given by Kristin Chenoweth . Seems that she 's improvising all the time , she 's so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside . Kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 Emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved . Also there 's the chemistry between actors and their characters , that are also amazing.There are no words to express what this TV Show really is and what it was meant to be . For those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it , for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had : childhood.Truth be told ... TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one . "" Pushing Daisies "" was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful . It 's true that TV does n't respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except "" Heroes "" that 's still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones ."	1
Not as bad , as it 's credited to being ( Hooper 's done far worse )   more so disappointing for me . Such an imaginative concept , which is never really tapped in to by Hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky ( excuse the pun ) writing . It goes so sinister and over - the - top in a dead serious tone , becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy - laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt . Because of that , the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif ( cool to see him in a leading role ) seems to struggle with an off - balanced performance , despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off - colour character . Even though it 's cheaply done , there 's a competent technical attitude to it . However it does n't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts ( which some do work ) and strikingly steaming special effects ( flames , flames everywhere ) instead . Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery ( more so towards the latter end ) , and the camera - work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating . The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince , Cynthia Bain , Dey Young , Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon . Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small , but amusing cameos   especially Landis . Nothing surprises , but it 's passably engaging .	0
"I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on Snoop Dogg 's appearance ( a passionate fetish of theirs ) on the cover . Understandably , I did not expect much . I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos . However , my generalization was for the most part wrong . Unfortunately , this did n't make the movie any better.Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama , whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick . The film tells a story of two struggling writers ( Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg ) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces . Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship . This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller - coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop 's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder . And although the movie is a drama , the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else.I would n't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that . There are some mediocre conflicts , but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue . The end , however , jumped at me with a sudden surprise . It was a little bit twisted , somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end . While watching the ending credits I could n't help but picture the director thinking , "" Oh God , how the hell do I end this snoozer . "" By the way , the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters ."	0
I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with ' Zombie Bloodbath ' as one of it 's alternative titles . Perversely , this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title ; which may mean that the other one is really bad ! This film is pretty bad too ; obviously you ca nt go into a film that calls itself ' Zombie Bloodbath ' and expect to see a masterpiece , and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display ... but it all feels very old and tired , which is n't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line . It 's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc . The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you 're in for ; low quality zombie garbage . There 's plenty of gore in the film , and it 's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring . Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too , and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers ! The main influence seemed to be Romero 's superior Day of the Dead , although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore . It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall I ca n't say I was impressed with it !	0
For those looking for a sequel for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s , this is n't it . Nor is it a historical drama . Rather , it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical Shaka , but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclair 's idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus , Lincoln , Superman , and Nelson Mandela.On the other hand , there are a few laugh - out - loud moments , as when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt . You know , like Jesus would have done if he had n't been such a wimp.True , I saw only the 98-minute version , but I ca n't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better.And what kind of a name is Mungo ? !	0
"A pointless movie with nothing but gratuitous violence . The only fun I had was playing "" spot the location "" , as much of it was filmed in my home town of Regina , Saskatchewan . I like to support locally produced films but this one was a major disappointment ."	0
"I loved this masterpiece and quite frankly I , too found Mary Poppins ( although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke ) to be silly and sacrine - sweet . Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I do n't know why people think of this film as distorted . It was magical and it was lots of fun to watch . Every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better . You truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other , despite their age and differences . I thought the characters were well developed , especially Charles who was at "" The Age of not Believing "" . Mary Poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that I will always love and cherish ."	1
Wow , I ca n't believe people consider this a ' good ' movie . Now , I have seen much worse , but there are much more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack.This is a mediocre film at best . While the acting was n't terrible , but not great , for a romantic comedy , there was little passion , little romance . There were many loose ends that do n't show up or are not addressed . Unfortunately , the main characters do come off as complete cowards . They do n't know themselves well enough to realize that they do n't love the people they are engaged to . How do we know they are n't in love ? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances . I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.The movie does n't even end with a wedding scene , more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing . This movie is really about two people who ca n't commit to anything , unlike Cusack 's previous characters , who were more than willing to make a deep commitment ( Loyd in Say Anything , Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank , etc.).The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns , or anything of interest . When the movie ended , I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story , which basically fits the whole movie : boring . No suspense about whether the two will end up together , no joy when they do , no consequences to their actions.It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie , that they simply rebuke any criticism with ' Everyone is too Cynical ! ' . Criticism of this movie is not cynicism , simply unbiased examination . There are many other better romantic comedies , even ones with Grace Kelly , or Eva Marie Saint.If you think this movie is great , try these movies , you hearts will explode : The Princess Bride , Say Anything , Grosse Pointe Blank , High Fidelity , Keeping the Faith , Charade , Rear Window , North by Northwest , or There 's Something About Mary ( which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today 's society ) .	0
"Call me stupid , but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie , Valentine . It was so well - made , well - written , well - acted , well - directed , etc ! Everything about it was wonderful ! There were parts that were relatively routine ( Lily 's death ) , very funny ( www . Bleed - Me - Dry.com ) , completely horrifying and creepy ( Paige 's death ) , and just plain heartbreaking ( the first scene ) . I think the entire cast did a great job , especially the three leads : David Boreanaz , Denise Richards ( both of whom I met , and got autographs from , during the filming of this movie - VERY nice people ! ) , and Marley Shelton.I am very sick of people calling this movie "" another Scream clone "" . This movie is , in no way , a Scream clone . In fact , this film runs rings around Scream . It actually makes SENSE ! Scream was also NOT the only movie to feature a masked killer in it . Excuse me , but it looks like Scream was also a clone too ( ahem ... , Friday the 13th , Halloween , and many other scary movies also featured masked killers ) . I also think that the novelty of the cupid - masked killer is brilliant . It 's so strange to see a sweet , cupid face doing all of these horrible things . Another novelty ( the nose bleeding ) makes way for a fantastic ending ! The ending gives me chills every time I see it ! ! ! ! ! So , even if you did n't like it the first time , watch Valentine again and give it another chance!PS- Keep an eye out for my new website ( WWW.LOVE - HURTS.ORG ) ! Coming soon ..."	1
"Man oh man ... I 've been foolishly procrastinating ( not the right term , there 's a long list ! ) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so . And "" news "" are : Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!For any Von Trier 's "" follower "" : both Rigets , Element of Crime , Dogville , Dancer in The Dark , The Five Obstructions , etc ... Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms . Everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic ! You really get the feeling of being inside this "" imaginary "" nightmarish time warp . Taking from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel , Bergman , till noir films of the 40 's with acidic drops of avant - guard Von Trier leads the art - film scene as the "" well intended totalitarian "" movie maker of nowadays . His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues , without being irrational , hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.As Utopian as it seems , I do believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect . The day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary , as a tool for reflection , perhaps it could be the start of a new era : "" The age of emotional control over our fears "" . This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.Bravo !"	1
I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment . Once I realized I would not be getting that , I watched it for a pretty well made movie ( in terms of filming , and yeah .. that was it).But aside from it having a good film quality , considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long , there was nothing good about that movie.He killed 42.Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?Serisouly , Who can answer that for me?Who can answer anything awful about this movie for me.I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff . That 's all it seemed to be.Poor Mr . Carroll . I'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales .	0
"This has to be , hands down , hats off , one of the most uproarious comedies ever made . Starting with the animated blowing , popping bubbles , the entrance to the Daytime Awards , the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet , the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech , the venomous comments uttered by the actor 's jealous co - stars and producer , under phony smiles . Now THAT is only in the first few minutes . Then , all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous . Ridiculous in a good way , no , make that a great way . This was the first time I 'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher . While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives , she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark . Not a huge follower , but if I run across an episode I 'd watch it . Robert Downey , jr . , does a great turn as slimy , smarmy , snaky , sycophantic David Seaton Barnes , the producer who 'd give his right eye to see Sally Field 's Celeste Talbert leave the show , if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty 's Montana Moorehead.Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie , just as she had everywhere else she 's appeared . Here , all she has to do is scream "" I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP ! "" or give one of her anti - Celeste - co - conspirators an evil grin , and she has me rolling in the aisles . Yes , Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress , and one hell of a comedienne . Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM - sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies , and we 're all reminded why she is who she is today , having started off in comedy afraid of nothing . Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor , but like a caterpillar in a cocoon , the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was . The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy , serious roles , that you associate them with their character and you ca n't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher , if only for a glorified cameo . She does n't realize what a presence she bears on screen . She takes a role which , in the hands of a lesser actress , could easily have been forgotten , but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this ! At the time , she was n't really known for much . Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute ( yes , I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price ) , but she did n't hold my attention - - much . But here , she makes the most of her character - star 's niece who falls in love with the star 's ex - co - star - and - lover who , of course , turns out to be the niece 's father , and the star turns out to be the poor girl 's mother.I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy , or at least a novela . If you 've seen it , then reminisce . If you have n't , you 've missed a real classic , but not really . The DVD 's are made of a material that 'll last for at least 25 years , and this movie is timeless , so what the hell ."	1
The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.I bought it ex - rental for £ 3.00 , it looked interesting , so i took a chance.Within minutes of turning it on i realised i 'd made a mistake . The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire , where they could meet more of their kind.As for the Devin Hamilton ( Writer and Director ) , he should just be shot , sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.Avoid this film , If you see it in the shops run away.1/10	0
In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard . Or is it Travis Bickle ? or Rupert Pupkin ? Or Max Cady ? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro has played very very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER , THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts . I found it slightly difficult to believe that Renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho < br />The character arc is n't the only problem with this script - It also lacks a character focus ( A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat ) , for several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball . I 'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon < br />I will admit I was entertained by THE FAN ( Especially by the soundtrack ) but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by nutters as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , UNLAWFUL ENTRY etc had run out of steam a long time ago	0
Maybe you should n't compare , but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop . Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop , but they 've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break , of course for some it was and that 's nice . But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you 're wrong . It 's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce . Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned . They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . Yes , the rating for this movie is low , but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving . This is probably because although the story , the acting , the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful , the music and dancing is what the people love about it . Me , i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop ( i was so glad when round ' 86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared , like Krs One , Public Enemy , Ultramagnetic Mc 's , Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie to name a few ) , and i still do n't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it does n't work for me . I mean , Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic . Of course tastes differ and that 's alright . But as far as i 'm concerned , this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i ca n't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten .	0
This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion , its thought provoking , funny and sad with amazing performances all around ! . All the characters are wonderful , and the story is just brilliant ! , plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this ! . The Ending is very powerful , however I wo n't spoil it for you , and I thought the character development was top notch ! , plus you can really relate to all of the characters , especially Jeanie and Annie , as you will be rooting for them ! , plus I loved how it moved slowly , and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about . I ca n't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion , and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role , plus this is extremely well written and made as well ! . One scene that really got to me was when Madge(Marilyn Kagan ) , is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party , and the film has many surprising moments as well ! , plus the dialog is especially excellent .

Overall go see it immediately , it 's an underrated masterpiece ! . * * * * * out of 5	1
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was . The performances were extremely good , especially by Rea as the compassionate no - nonsense detective.Despite a low budget , no big FX or flashy camerawork , Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood films by just . Telling . The . Story.True stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang , and that 's the case here , but apart from that , this is a highly recommended detective yarn .	1
"When I first read Hamlet , I could n't help but think of the ending of OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE , where Bette Midler puts down the play because of how indecisive he is , and says , "" Give me Romeo any day . "" Five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not ? Seemed like overkill to me . But upon further reading , I grew to really appreciate the play . I 've seen the Olivier and Gibson movie versions(and part of the Nicol Williamson version ) , and all of them take their model from Olivier ; the melancholy Dane . Olivier at least did it without being self - indulgent about it , but Gibson and , from what I saw , Williamson , looked like they went to the "" Look , Ma , I 'm acting ! I 'm acting ! "" school.Now here comes Kenneth Branagh 's version , which is breathtaking from start to finish . It finished # 2 on my top ten of 1996(behind THE ENGLISH PATIENT , and ahead of LONE STAR , JERRY MAGUIRE , FARGO , SECRETS & LIES , EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU , FLIRTING WITH DISASTER , BIG NIGHT , and LOOKING FOR RICHARD ) , and it 's the best Hamlet , and maybe the best Shakespeare , put to film . Obviously , Branagh 's talents as a filmmaker , for making the full - length version , in 70 mm print , and not losing our interest for four hours , is great , but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role . This was my favorite performance of the year by far . Branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing Hamlet as a normal , regular human being , and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way . And unlike Olivier , who depended mostly on his voice , Branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that Hamlet goes through , but since he plays him as normal , none of it seems like scenery - chewing.The rest of the cast is top - notch as well . I did n't even mind Jack Lemmon , though I agree he was the weakest member of the cast . The most surprising turn came from Charlton Heston ; I 've always found him stiff as a board , but he 's quite commanding as the Player King . The other big surprise was Billy Crystal ; I thought I 'd find him all wrong as the 1st Gravedigger , but he was his usual funny self while being in character . All in all , a glorious film !"	1
"Yesterday was Earth Day ( April 22 , 2009 ) in the US and other countries , and I went to see the full - feature movie - version of "" Earth "" by DisneyNature . I guess , like the auto manufacturers , Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet . Maybe they really do care about the planet , I do n't know , but I do n't think it warrants a special unit with the word "" nature "" in it . I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse , and who am I to tell a one - year old my personal feelings about Disney ? < br />Aside from incredible cinematography , it was a typical Disney disappointment for me . Preceded by a half - dozen Disney movie trailers , rife with Disney cliché ( "" circle of life "" , "" falling with style "" ) , over - dramatic music , recycled footage ( Disney claims "" 40 % new footage "" ) . I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring . I like James Earl Jones , but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin . I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done , they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound - bites on it.And what is Disney 's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals ? There were a half - dozen such scenes , complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out . I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action - movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents . I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change . Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it 's still a controversial subject ? < br />I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix . Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the moment ."	0
If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics , spend your $ 9 on a used textbook , not this movie . I 'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool - Aid for shipment to Guyana . < br />I do n't think the directors really got any point across , but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several : 1 ) Science can explain everything we do , meaning that our lives are deterministic ; 2 ) Science ca n't be used to explain everything we do , meaning that we have free will ; 3 ) Science is , like , really cool , brother ; 4 ) We are God ; 5 ) The world exists only in our minds ; 6 ) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow and 7 ) here , put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you 'll see some really groovy stuff .	0
""" Holes "" is my all - time favorite movie ! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on DVD this upcoming September . I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were . The director of this film did an excellent job of re - creating the book into movie form . Also , all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters , especially Max Kasch as ZigZag . Props to all those involved in making this movie , it was a real success ! 10 out of 10 stars , I definitely recommend it for everyone to see !"	1
"I just want to say that I am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie . Bravo "" The Spaz "" , Bravo ! This movie is a ridiculous farce of film - making . Especially for a student film ! I just want to give credit to the Spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture , and then TO COMMENT ON IT ! Most people I know do n't have that kind of time , especially so few will end of reading it . Kudos to you sir ! Anyway , the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly . I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlie 's Angels but why hire such atrocious actresses ! Also , what kind of director has himself act , write , produce and also edit the picture ! Choose one job and put all your love into it man ! It 's such a shame because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush . Again , thanks to the Spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film , people like you are a rare find ."	1
I loved this show growing up and I still watch the first season DVD at age 19 today . What can I say ? I grew up in a house much like the one on Full House . I had a dad , two sisters , and a dog . I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad 's best friend . Also , I grew up with my mom in the house . I do n't know what I would have done without Full House on television . I think that Stephanie ( played by Jodie Sweetin ) , D.J. ( played by Kirk Cameron 's sister Candace ) , and Michelle ( Played by Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen ) are my favorite characters . I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steph , I am a younger sister like Michelle , and I am an older sister like D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values because I do n't really like any of the O.C.-like shows today . I like the comedy of Full House , too . Uncle Jesse ( John Stamos ) , Joey ( Dave Coulier ) , and Danny ( Bob Saget ) are hilarious as the girls ' uncle , dad 's friend , and dad , respectively . The story goes that , after the girls ' mom dies , Danny 's best friend Joey and his brother - in - law , Jesse move in to help raise the kids . Three men trying to raise three young girls = hilarious . Each character on Full House is full of heart , funny , and genuinely believable . Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid 's heart and soul . Jesse is the cool , motorcycle riding , tough - guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces , and later , his wife Becky ( Laurie Laughlin , from Summerville ) . Both kids and adults will love this show . Guaranteed .	1
This movie will confuse you to death . Furthermore , if your a Denise Richards ' fan , do n't even think of renting this movie . Besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about 10 minutes of air time if that , she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots .	0
"Contrary to its title , this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish . All Humor appears forced , theatrical , mechanical , staged , reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video , including even the mannerisms . Everybody is screaming , shouting and doing odd things for no reason . The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood 's ' Boeing Boeing "" . John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here . If we keep morality factor aside , even then the bizarre events looks trite . Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal , two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain . At least , the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless , buxomed bimbettes ( 3Bs ) who talk , behave and even scream in quite similar fashion . The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other ? Just to do some Sex , what else ? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways . Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily . But surely , great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial . Now for those who call it a situational comedy , I call it a pathetic taste . Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic , weird and maddening type of humor , where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things ?"	0
Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid , good fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie .... Have Fun with bad movies . Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70 's were for horror flicks Bad Effects , Bad Dialog , just bad movie making . Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it . While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection .	0
This is one of the weakest soft porn film around . I ca n't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes . The guy Mike is a major wimp and moron I ca n't believe he did n't want to take a shower with his bride - to - be Toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer Jan. He does do a threesome with Toni and Kristi but that was short I hate that every time in Soft Core Porn Films threesomes between a woman , a man , and a woman is short but a girl - girl thing is about an hour . To the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should 've have two threesome scenes not one but two .	0
Ok , first the good : Cher 's performance and the cinematography . Although I 'm no Cher fan , she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written . The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.The Rest : a thin plotline , Nicholas Cage 's performance , and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian - American family from New York . Firstly , everytime time Cage opened his mouth I cringed . I do n't know what kind of accent he was trying use . I honestly do n't , it sure was nt any New York or Italian accent I 've ever heard . It was quite surreal . And it was n't because I 'm some stickler for accuracy , his voice just cloyed in my ears . And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances . Secondly , and this is purely anecdotal , but I have many Italian relations , friends and acquaintances in New York City , and frankly I 've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided . And that would be on a boring night at the house . What a let down .	0
"Richard Willaims is an animation god . He was hampered in directing this film by the producer . The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story , but some amazing moments of animation ( like Emery Hawkins ' "" Greedy "" ) . Joe Raposo 's repetitive music does n't help either . It was made in wide screen so the VHS does n't show it in all it 's glory , let 's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday . Still it 's worth watching for some eye popping animation ."	1
"After repeated listenings to the CD soundtrack , I knew I wanted this film , got it for Christmas and I was amazed . Marc Bolan had such charisma , i ca n't describe it . I 'd heard about him in that way , but did n't understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this footage . He was incredible . Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On , etc . ( I 'm still learning the song titles ) . George Claydon , the diminutive photographer from Magical Mystery Tour , plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors . Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it , even though I put the spoilers disclaimer on this review , so you would just need to see this for yourselves . It evades description . < br />Yes , I love the Beatles and was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now , I finally find out it 's been on DVD for 2 years , but it 's finally in my home . It 's an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling . < br />Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user : < br />There 's two hidden extras on the Born To boogie double DVD release . < br />1.From the menu on disc one , select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2.On the extra scenes page goto Scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3.when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a "" Star+1972 "" logo appears 4.Press Enter < br />5.From the main menu on disc two , select the sound options 6.On the sound options page goto the 90/25 ( I think that s right ) option and keep pressing left 7.When the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a "" Star+Home video "" logo appears 8.Press Enter"	1
The Hazing is confused mumbo - jumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times . The problem is , it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie . This movie is nowhere near as original . The plot has been used before , by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons , and that was a lot more fun . This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings.Brad Dourif is , as usual , not given much to do here , but when he is on screen he puts in another over - the - top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous . As for the acting of the kids , it 's passable but by no means good . The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric . There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims , but it was never scary for a second . The gore level is mid - range to low , but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times . All in all , just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste .	0
Jeff Wincott is not only a Hunk , he can kick butt ! This movie has some of the best Martial arts moves I 've seen in a very long time . Ok , so maybe Bridgette Nielson is n't the first person I 'd hire to play a ruthless politician , she did a GREAT job nontheless ! And let 's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Martial arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd . So she 's not Cynthia Rothrock , Who CARES ? ! She 's just as good , if not BETTER ! ( just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie , one word : OUCH ! ! ) . My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible , because if you have n't seen it , you 're really missing out on some great martial arts action .	1
"When I took my seat in the cinema I was in a cool mood and did n't plan on changing it . But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse . I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward . So what have we ? Theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen , Denmark . It came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from "" Bend it like Beckham "" , where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister . Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother 's wedding by doing Kung Fu . And we have a love story and a competition of course , too . After I accepted this , this really turned out to be a gripping , emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful Kung Fu ( I 'm not an expert , though ) . The lead actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark 's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance , so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress . Rest of the supporting cast is okay , camera good , Kung Fu intense . Sidenotes : - The male Turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right . - The audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge . - Xian Gao , a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu instructor / actor ( Hidden Tiger , Crouching Dragon ) played the lead role 's master < br />If you get the chance to see this in cinema do it , you 'll probably have a good and intense experience and I do n't know if this works on small screen as well"	1
"Well , the movie is n't exactly "" funny . ""Okay , I admit , there are a few HUMOROUS lines , but definitely nothing that is laugh - out - loud funny . For example : Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars , sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he can not remove her shirt . Before leaving the room to retrieve the key , he tells her , "" Okay , do n't go anywhere . ""See , humorous , but not funny.The plot and acting are pretty good.But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show . She 's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one ca n't help but rewind and re - watch.There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.Overall , 5 stars . I 'd only give it three if not for Erika Eleniak ."	1
This movie was packed pull of endless surprises ! Just when you thought it could n't get worse , they added more joints and more pink fuzzy - lined vans with raunchy sex scenes . As you can guess , I was a victim of the original version . We were tricked into watching it thinking it was Supervan , the host box which promised lasars , jail breaks , and much more . Who would have thought a Dollar Store Christmas present could have been so much fun !	0
Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate . In the Stargate universe , humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa'uld such as Ra and Apophis . For millennia , the Goa'uld harvested humanity , heavily influencing and spreading human cultures . As a result , Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs , Mayans , Britons , the Norse , Mongols , Greeks , and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy . Many well - known mythical locations such as Avalon , Camelot , and Atlantis are found , or have at one time existed.Presently , the Earth stargate ( found at a dig site near Giza in 1928 ) is housed in a top - secret U.S. military base known as the SGC ( Stargate Command ) underneath Cheyenne Mountain . Col . Jack O'Neill ( Anderson ) , Dr. Daniel Jackson ( Shanks ) , Capt . Samantha Carter ( Tapping ) and Teal'c ( Judge ) compose the original SG-1 team ( a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons ) . Along with 24 other SG teams , they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the Goa'uld , in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.The parasitic Goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . Throughout the first eight seasons , the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists . They are a race of highly intelligent , ruthless snake - like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species , including humans . The original arch - enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis ( Peter Williams ) . Other System Lords , such as Baal and Anubis , play pivotal roles in the later seasons . In the ninth season a new villain emerges , the Ori . The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy , also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori , their followers , and their enemiesthe Ancients .	1
"How could I best express my feelings about this movie : hideous ? a headache ? lack of coherent writing ? plain stupidity ? Try all of the above for this travesty . And that just for the direction.Story ? Well I guess there is a story . Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course . They are mistaken for a ' world renounced assassin ' ( sarcasm ) and are ' hired ' by two ' mobsters ' . One thinks "" taking him out "" means a date , and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of . And of course , the turtle reserve for the farting turtle , that they build with the casino winnings.Sounds likes all this could be funny ? Guess again . They try to make it funny , but its not . Filming sequences are n't well done . I 've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies . Visuals are average for a late 80s film . But the problem is that its a 2007 movie.Not worth my time to ever watch this again . It still does n't beat Danny Glover 's "" Out "" movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time , but then again that film is in a class of its own . "" F """	0
Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore - fests , but the truth is that his films actually are n't bad at all . The Re - Animator sequels are n't as great as the original , but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned . Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series ; and Society is n't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece . This thriller certainly is n't a masterpiece ; but it shows Yuzna 's eye for horror excellently , and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging . I 'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry did n't turn up until 1996 , as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it 's running away from a tiger for the modern world . Dentistry does n't frighten me , but surprisingly ; I would appear to be in the minority . The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone . He has a nice house , a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want . However , his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife 's affair with the pool cleaner . And his life is n't the only one ; as it 's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger ... When it comes to scaring the audience , this movie really makes itself . However , credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme . The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I 'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes ! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline , only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there 's more to the film than what we 're seeing . It is n't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this wo n't be winning any awards , the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot . The acting , while B - class , is actually quite impressive ; with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge . I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie . The Dawn of the Dead star does n't get enough work , and I really love seeing him in films . The rest of the cast does n't massively impress , but all do their jobs well enough . Overall , The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies . The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans , and I do n't hesitate to recommend this film .	1
Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise . It 's easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters . The fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people , and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else I 've ever heard of . It does n't get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire , it 's just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem . The way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic- there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just do n't work , which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part.The other area that really stood out to me is the languages . The fictional city of Mallepa contains various cultural groups , and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak . Japanese gang members speak Japanese to each other , but Chinese when talking to characters of Chinese descent . Possibly the most amusing exchange involves an Australian and is conducted in English . The actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others ' languages , so it 's quite a feat that the movie was made at all . Which , I suppose , brings me to the lead actors.Much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of Japan 's biggest rockstars , Gackt and Hyde , as well as Taiwanese superstar Lee - hom Wang , whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them . In my opinion , Lee - hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character . However , any lack of acting ability on Gackt 's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over - dramatic . I was n't sure if Hyde 's character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across , but it does n't really detract from the movie either way.There are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns , which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally ( Although this does n't seem to stop a lot of people ) . I found it 's best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously- It 's perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends . It does have its flaws , but overall it was very enjoyable and I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who does n't mind a few subtitles .	1
"You sit there for a half an hour and watch a story , believing it all , then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling ... and then put back together again . Brilliant.One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary . I do n't know if - other than Andrew Jarecki 's "" Capturing the Friedmans "" - there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski 's "" Forbidden Lie$. "" It features , exposes , defends , reveals , and questions everything about Norma Khouri , author of "" Honor Lost , "" the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in Jordan.What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this "" exposure "" of Khouri is made with Khouri 's full participation.For the initial portion of the film , Khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in Amman , the story of the book . She sounds completely believable , convincing.Then her story is taken apart , exposed , by eminently believable and convincing people , such as women 's rights activists in Jordan , investigative reporters there and in Australia , where Khouri lived for a while.Khouri comes back and denies the accusations , taking a successful lie - detector test in the process . There comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations ( not all , but the essential ones in the matter of the book).And the Houdini act continues , with round after round in this heavy - weight , seesaw prize fight , surprise after surprise - and there is no "" happy ending "" in the sense of resolution . Brilliant ."	1
"Was this a comedy or was it a drama ? I begin this review by asking this question because the film that I just witnessed , Hollywood Shuffle , was neither funny or rather dramatic . While it tried so hard to make a point , because of this lack of definition ( comedy or drama ) , the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost . While I am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in Hollywood , even today , I do not believe that Townsend 's directorial debut did much to stop it . Instead , I feel it only added more fuel to the fire . Townsend 's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of , he was instead promoting and vice versa . The parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy . Townsend had a decent concept with this film , but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film . If you watch the preview before the film ( which I constantly do ) , you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see . The preview gives the impression of a very intelligent , comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers , but the actually film could not be further from the truth.The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not story itself ( because it is lacking in elaboration ) ; it is Townsend 's direction . He had a wonderful concept with this film . Exploit the Hollywood that exploits our race . Decent idea , but why could n't he execute it very well ? The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic . The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital , we are literally everywhere without any warning or map . It was obvious that Townsend had quite a bit to say , but only a short amount of time to do it in . So , instead of defining his characters , developing his themes , and actually creating a smart film , he just throws it all together and prays that it works . Sadly , it does n't . Instead of a smart comedy , we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas , comedic skits , and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable . What hurts Townsend the most are his brief , attempt to be funny , interruptions throughout the film . From battling a villain known as Jerry Curl to parodying Siskel & Ebert , Townsend 's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters . This is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally . While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in Hollywood , he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book . What could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.So , if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story , perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the Wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story . WRONG ! The Wayans are in this film , but Townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family . Definitely in their pre - In Living Color moments , we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon . Perhaps it was Townsend 's direction , or just maybe this atrocious story , but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film . I just thought that with the talent pool that Townsend had to pull from that Hollywood Shuffle would have been funny , bright , and a true stab at this obvious Hollywood dilemma . Sadly , it was none of the above.Finally , I would like to say that this was a workable film . There were some moments ( while they were few and way far between ) that had a smile on my face , the final product just did n't settle well with me . Townsend can be funny , but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself , instead of through his personal experiences and troubles . I realize that he was probably speaking the truth , but it never came through as that . Instead , we are threaded through a weak story , which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom , but surely did n't work for this film . Even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film , I would have to disagree . If you are starting fresh , either have a tight script or defined themes . Townsend had neither of these , and combined with the inability to control his actors , he just failed in a ball of flames.Overall , this was rather disappointing to watch . It reminded me of a grade school Spelling Bee where it is finally your child 's time to spell . The word is tough , but as the first two to three letters come out , you think that it is going to work perfectly , but then there is that random "" P "" and silent "" R "" that forces your excitement to come tumbling down . That is how I felt with Hollywood Shuffle . At first , I saw the potential , I saw the theme and the motive behind the picture , but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes , I experienced that deep fall feeling . Townsend sank his own ship on this one , and I do n't think Hollywood Shuffle will ever re - submerge as a pivotal moment of Hollywood cinema.Grade : * out of * * * * *"	0

"Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more , even from a score of 5.8 IMDb , the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal , the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a "" worst case scenario "" of playing "" strong "" feelings accompanied by some bad acting ... Do n't waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining , if you wanna cry it might suffice though , even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy ... I give this 2/10 it really was awful , if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it , its all the good things this movie is n't ."	0
This movie is among my favorite foreign films , some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog . The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films , is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson . < br />In Japan , a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life , sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio . In the instant that it takes his train to pass , he is enthralled by her . But is it only by her beauty , by her faraway glance , or a connection that they will both discover that they share ? < br />Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance . Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society , they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away . It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and , in itself , transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be .	1
"If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry ( Yash Raj ) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards.If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil , Akshay , Saif and Kareena , then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film . The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar . He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone can not make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film . That itself was a clear indicator of the director 's vision . Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted . Anil Kapoor 's gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times . And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.In short IT 'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER "" JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM "" . I would say that even "" Aaja Nachle "" was a better enjoyable movie than this.One can not understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved . The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay 's love story . After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music . Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song . The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically . Only one song "" Falak Tak Chal "" is somehow good of all in the lot . An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this : Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location ( probably Ladakh ) . In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car . I am still thinking who wrote this.If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts . You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD . Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved ? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar , If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out . As artists of such stature , you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers . People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively . I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie , the actors and the production house both ."	0
Do n't let the title trick you into watching this movie . I read the title , saw that it came on in the middle of the night , and figured it was one of those soft porn movies . This movie is bad . If you like soft porn movies , then I 'm sorry to say this is n't one . There are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so .	0
First I liked that movie . It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments . The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best ! ! ! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste ! ! ! But the script writers disappointed me extremely . The best ending would be the scene on the ladder , but instead of it , they decided that the father and his daughter should be together . Do n't like the ending . The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex - wife knows about it and finds it alright . It would be OK , if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body , but they did not , they only deprived him of memories . The actors were good , they were really funny . Cybill Shepherd was charming , Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : ) ) ) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting . For example , Corinne Jeffries , played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years ( it 's a long time ! ) , she was true to him , she loved nobody but him , and when she met him and was just about making love to him , after a scene with her friend Philip Train ( Ryan O'Neal ) , she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years ! ! ! It would be a good movie , if not the ending and some missed human psychology .	0
Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title ' Come Undone ' , April 25 , 26 , & 27 , 2001 . The cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling . Even with fall / winter backgrounds for the ' present ' and spring summer for the ' flashbacks ' there can be some difficulty following the continuity.Whether either lead is gay , the actors well - portray the budding relationship in real life terms ; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking . The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning . But as the end approaches , you really care about where these guys will be next summer ! You , too , will want a sequel to find out .	1
Unfortunately , this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original . Nicholas Cage , fairly wooden as far as actors go , imbues the screen with a range of skill from , non - plussed to over the top . The supporting cast is no better.The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse . Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold . It turns out it 's just a bill of poor goods . Disbelief can not be suspended , nor can a befit of a doubt be given . The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual , as the medium requires , and whomever scouted the location should be commended.There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos , literally , at the end.Disappointed ! Wait for the original to come on television , pour a whiskey and enjoy .	0
Everyone is either loving or hating this film . I am going with loving . It is so well shot and so well acted . Beautiful . This film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making . If you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this . But if you like the tops of acting , photography , story and development , look no further then here .	1
"I 'll keep the review of this program as short as possible . Skip it . Low budget , not funny , lousy script . Acting not quite as bad as the writing , but still bad . That 's all you need to know , but I will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary.This is a film with three segments , each one parodying some other type of movie . A MUCH funnier film with this same exact idea is "" Movie Movie , "" with George C. Scott . Very obscure , but worth searching out . MM parodied films of the 1930 's , and did it with elegance , precision and dry wit.This movie did not . It parodies three types of films , supposedly from the late 70 's , early 80 's era , only it is parodying films I 've ( almost ) never heard of . The first is , I guess , a parody of "" Kramer Vs . Kramer , "" in a way . Peter Reigert does his best with a dirt poor script . The second is a parody , of , I do n't know what ... a Danielle Steele novel ? I mean , you might see a story like this on Lifetime TV , but in a movie theater ? I mean , I remember the 70 's , I was there . This is a soap - opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power . These type of things usually parody themselves , so I do n't see how this was even necessary.We are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment , "" The Municipalians , "" which parodies cop movies . I noted elements of "" The New Centurians "" and some "" Dirty Harry "" , both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created . Yeah , nice and current . Robby Benson plays the idealistic young rookie ( over - the - top wimpy ) while Richard Widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car ( OH ! Stop ! My sides ! He 's actually drinking booze in the Police car ! How irreverent ! ) Note that this was the first film after "" Animal House "" to have the "" National Lampoon "" name attached . Wow . To go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking . I could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting - edge and original voices in American humor ( that would be National Lampoon , the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so ) to sell out and begin a long , slow slide into a world of crap , where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low - budget "" comedy "" films for a fee . Yet another reason why capitalism ( and cocaine ) sucks so bad.Anyway , this movie is a serious time suck . Do n't waste your 90 minutes . I want mine back . On the positive side , Fred Willard 's in it !"	0
One of my all time favourite films , ever . Just beautiful , full of human emotion , wit , humour , intelligence . The story grows , as does the lesson of life , just a wonderful film in so many ways.The cast are also fantasic ..... a great selection of the finest British talent around . I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film.Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this , - everything about this film works.<br / > I love it :)	1
This is an absolutely incredible film . It shows South African racism from the perspective of the victims , and provokes a feeling of anti - racism in everyone who sees it . It is the best historic film I have ever seen .	1
"This Peabody Award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st Season where a holodeck malfunction traps Captain Picard , Beverly , Data , and a Starfleet historian named Waylan within a 1930 's San Francisco setting . This episode is an homage to Raymond Chandler 's "" Maltese Falcon "" where Patrick Stewart assumes the Humphrey Bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat . The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in Bogey 's "" Maltese Falcon . "" < br />This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the Jarada that communicate with mostly a high - pitched buzzing sound . Communication with this alien race is difficult , and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin . The best part of this episode , though , is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B - actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of the gangster Cyrus Redblock . He was such a handsome man back in the 1940 's . Oh , well ..."	1
"I thought the movie "" I Do They Do n't "" was fantastic . In the past I 've watched Rob Estes on "" Suddenly Susan "" & "" Melrose Place "" and also Josie Bissett on "" Melrose Place "" and loved seeing them together again in "" I Do They Do n't "" . They have great chemistry together ( I guess being married in real life helps that ! ) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball . Of course they stumble , but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about . So many people have been talking about this movie - all good ! - and the movie left us wanting more . This would make a great series - appealing to many ages ! - it would be so nice to see a real life , down to earth , family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called "" Reality TV "" that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days . Someone tell the people at ABC Family they have the start of a new series here !"	1
I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT . Even he could n't make this movie enjoyable . The only reason I watched it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though . It 's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.If you took the actual film , dipped it in paint thinner , then watched it , it would be more entertaining . Seriously.If you see this movie in the bargin bin at S - Mart , back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake .	0
"I 'd completely forgotten about this film until now . This was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that I have ever seen . It 's message seemed to be : "" Do n't teenagers use their imagination ; they might take games seriously , go mad and hurt people . "" I can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that D&D style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship ."	0
This film is just another distortion , among many distortions , on the so - called ' sins of consumerism ' . Please note that ' Reverend Billy ' , an actor ( Bill Talen ) , is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the ' sins of consumerism ' . We might want to ask are questions , like : What does ' Reverend Billy ' do for a living ? How does he make his money ? Does he make his living off his ' tax - deductible ' organization ? How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a ' tax - deductible ' church or organization ? < br />Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized , but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable , and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . Everyone is not charitable . Everyone does not spend time with their families , friends , or extended families . But , holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity . Yes , America does have more than its share of problems -- but , with perseverance , Americans have and always make it through great difficulties . And , even in times of strife , America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world . That happens when Americans pull together and unite , rather than to separate and divide . Yes , there are problems with corporations and monopolies , but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses , along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities . Yes , globalization has brought us its share of problems , but it will take Americans to bring production back to America . Americans and the U.S. government need to learn how to stay on a budget , no matter how large or small it may be , and we must stop our dependence on credit . Our over - reliance on credit will make , and keep us poor , from the cradle to the grave . It is important to buy -- but , if we buy less , we will rely less on credit . And , if we are able to save , even a small amount of money , we will have money for a rainy day . Not to say that , as Americans , we will gain an equal share of wealth . Wealth is not guaranteed , and has never been guaranteed . But , stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of America 's wealth . There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper , middle class . And , who knows what can happen from there ? ! ? Be positive , work hard -- and , at the very least , you and I will be able to reach at least some ( if not all ) of our dreams . In life , nothing is guaranteed , but we always have that something to reach for . And , if you or I do n't have dreams , we might as well be dead . In America , there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams . As individuals , we are a part of the pack , but we always can become the leader of the pack.It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions , but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs , values , and perspectives . But , as far as the distortions expressed , within this film , I do not have any faith in such beliefs , values , and perspectives . I rank this film with a 1 out of 10 - -but , in all honesty and truth , this film deserves a zero . This film has no integrity , and I can not recommend it .	0
* * POSSIBLE SPOILERS**The biggest part of the movie that does n't work IS the Wendigo , and when your title character fails , your movie usually is n't far behind it . The filmmakers ' interpretation of the Wendigo 's form is interesting , and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror , for instance - and the tree - form was actually very good . However , as a monster character it never really comes to life . We do n't get much of an explanation for its behavior , and what we DO see from it does n't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself , or any Wendigo lore I 've ever read.I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is n't given enough to do , in the movie . When you boil this film down to its bones , what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element , instead of a movie about a monster.The cinematography is good , though a little cheesy ; the filmmakers use scenery , lighting , and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well . The character of Otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable , making him the real monster in the film . It might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo , which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend.I have heard unconfirmed reports ( from a newsgroup ) that the reason the Wendigo does n't do much is that , when the monster suit was built , it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves , the performer had to walk on his toes ) that it was nearly impossible to run , walk , or otherwise perform in it . Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still , and the obvious sped - up footage of it running . I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed .	1
I was expecting a very funny movie . Instead , I got a movie with a few funny jokes , and many that just did n't work . I did n't like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes ' and Moriarty 's descendants . It was confusing . It would have been more funny if they just had someone new , instead of Moriarty resurrected . Some of the things were funny . Burt Kwouk was very funny , as always . McCloud on the horse was funny . The McGarrett from Hawaii 5 - 0 was not even McGarrett - like . Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents . She is from Indiana , but played English and a New Yorker pretty well . Unfortunately , she was not presented much into the script . I was expecting a more funny film . Instead , I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script . Rather ironic , since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one . Maybe they were about to break up in 77 .	0
"This impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man , in a mortal world . Her "" community "" is open among it 's members , but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals .

Kim Novak is always a pleasure on screen , but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual ( but not fatal to the story).With re - newed interest in all things witchy and dark , this film deserves to be discovered and re - discovered by old and new audiences ......

World At War is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time . The historical research is virtually flawless . Even after a quarter century , it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about WW2 . An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war . I highly recommend it as a learning experience .	1
"Now , I 'm no film critic , but I truly hated "" September 11 "" . This film was , on a general basis , bad . With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu 's segment , which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter , the short films were at best boring , and at worst offensive . The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine 's pretentious segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers , even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause . The segment was completely off topic and , considering Chahine 's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever , a waste of my time and patience . The idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper , but in practice , it was tasteless ."	0
.... this movie basks too much in its own innocence . It does n't tell a story ; it 's more a big time snooze fest . While the actors are all personable , the story is so trite and goes nowhere . I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma , but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .	0
Although I generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time ; this film is an exception . I did n't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake , so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison.The story and the way it is written is no question : it is Capote . There is no need for more words.The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb . I have seen some movies with them , each in one or the other . I was certain that they are good actors and in case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother . This time this certainty is raised to fact , no question . His play , just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves .	1
"Is nothing else on TV ? Are you really bored ? Well , then watch Phat Beach . However , do n't rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it . That would be a big mistake.I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points . I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard . However , there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at . If you are looking for an extremely funny "" hood "" movie then watch Friday . If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie ( something that this movie tries at .. kind of ) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason 's Lyric . If you are lookin for some good black "" booty "" go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick , because the nudity in this movie is nearly non - existent . However , if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable , go ahead and watch it . You will be slightly amused.***3 out of 10 * * *"	0
I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young . I did n't know who any of the actors were , and I did n't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed . I sure loved it though.Warren Beatty stars as the crime - fighting 1930 's detective Dick Tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city . This time , Big Boy Caprice ( Al Pacino ) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend Breathless Mahoney ( Madonna ) who has her eye on Tracy . It becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is : this criminal has no face . He or she is very unknown . Plus , the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.I thought that this movie was very colorful and creative . It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child . Warren Beaty was just like James Bond of the 1930 's the way he played Dick Tracy.An ensemble cast of the film includes : Charlie Korsmo , Glenn Headly , William Forsythe , Dustin Hoffman , James Caan , Ed O ' Ross , Tommy Lee Jones , Mandy Patinkin , Charles Durning . Plus More!Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy . Take my word for it .	1
When HEY ARNOLD ! first came on the air in 1996 , I watched it . It was one of my favorite shows . Then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it . I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD ! THE MOVIE since it does n't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS . Nevertheless , having nothing better to do , I went to see the movie anyway . Going into the theater , I was n't expecting much . I was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens ' cartoon like the RECESS movie was . I guess I got what I expected . It was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more . There were some good parts here and there , but for the most part , the movie was a stinker . Simply for kids .	0
"I saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it . Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther . Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match maid in heaven . This film also introduced me to William H. Macy , who is now one of my favorite actors . Hank was great as the Blue Raja , and I especially loved that the character was n't really British . The scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes . I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball . Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and his character Mr. Furious 's false rage , and the fact that his threats and one - liners were all gibberish , and that they never made any sense . I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said "" fraculater , Freinken - puss , "" was said . But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie . I HIGHLY recommend this film for any occasion , and I give it my own personal two - thumbs - up ."	1
It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone , Brian DePalma , Al Pacino , and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage . It is nice to see people so rich and ' successful ' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable , trite , and pathetic pieces of film - making of all time . This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.What is this ? Is it based on a true story . Well , they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today . But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a ' cuban ' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture ; kind of like Rocky on cocaine . Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans ? For the life of me I do n't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie . The accents are totally fake , and scene with Antonio 's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values . The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show . Is this movie about Miami ? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida . Afterall , a palm tree is a palm tree . Is this a romance novel . The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo , and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other . Is this a drug movie ? Well , no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned . The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water . Admittedly , the acting is terrible.Let 's get to the rest . The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show . I think I heard a polka ? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective . Clearly , the photography budget was excessive . The sound is bleached in a number of spots , and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse . The writing is appalling . This is one of those movies were the script writes itself . You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next , each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.So I am going to ask , Is this even a movie ? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours . But at least a drama series has some kind of focus . Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together . Whatever it is , movie or not , it is a piece of crap .	0
"Slither is a horror comedy that does n't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other . It has one scene that is exceptionally good , any number of zingers that work , but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie . In addition , the script does not focus on the hero and heroine , and goes off kilter in several places.A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero ( Fillion ) to follow Grant Grant ( Michael Rooker ) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster . This whole part of the film drags - Michael Rooker 's character is n't that interesting to us as a person , and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster 's interest might be interesting if this was Grant - Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horror - comedy alien invasion movie . In the final analysis this movie 's problems are in the script - it is n't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates . The purpose of a horror - comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them , with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens . Instead we get an exploration of the alien 's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag . The ostensible heroine ( Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant ) is more central to this part , but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track , unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end.When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook , but once again the problem is in the script . By this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that Grant is not just suffering from some disease , and act accordingly ( shotguns ) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that "" let us get you to a hospital "" is going to help . Although their reactions might have been human and real , these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action . A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.<br / > * * * SPOILERS AHEAD * * * After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack ( a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie ) the script once again betrays the movie . At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien . The writer - director ( Gunn ) chooses as this character a completely new character , rather than one of already developed minor characters . Why ? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot ? By the time this character is attacked , we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her , even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath . Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters , he could have completely avoided introducing her family , and saved time and money . Furthermore , the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien 's plans without all the additional characters , and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.My last criticism is based on the movie 's look . Gunn is primarily a writer , or maybe it was budgetary constraints , but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting . Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field , and the screen simply looks drab . The sets in Wheelsy ( the fictional town where the action takes place ) look cheap . The whole movie looks cheap . Box Office Mojo states the films ' budget was $ 15 million , newspapers say $ 29 million , and considering they did n't use any name talent , I would say the money did not show up on screen . The monster is just repulsive , and rarely looks deadly.The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character 's actions . By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grant / the alien , one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals . At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff . A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered , and a local has been acting psychotic . Time to call the authorities . But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT.Although this movie is ostensibly a horror - comedy , the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions . Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story ( especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot ) and particularly the ending , in many ways it was stronger , primarily because the main characters were stronger , but more importantly because it looked beautiful . Although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither ."	0
"I have yesterday seen the second part . And I must say , it was actually better then the first one . At the begin , I realized , It is actually a sequel , not a remake but not a good one . I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica , because the cylons saw like toasters ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie ) and were completely harmless for the old galactica . This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . Many scenes were unnecessary , for instance the story of the "" computer expert "" - completely a crap . If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house , killed by the cylon woman . And the evacuation from the planet ? Oh , please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons ( why exactly 50 MT ? ? ) nukes , they would be dead killed by the radiation . And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ? Aha , it was possibly this computer virus , created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten - years - old school boy . The good side of the movie is , that the humans are at last defeated ! ! Really defeated , the population is near the extinction ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie : 1 . a baby ! ! ! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence ... ) . And the bad - asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci - fi galaxy fight movie . I also appreciate the design of the cylons ( not only of the humanoid cylon:- ) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons . The human ships are a good never version of the old ones . And galactica - really pretty with these docks , I liked that . But this is all , only the design is not enough . The acting was really bad , the whole plot was expectable ( only two things not - the human - cylon on the ragnardocks and the human - cylon at the end).The dialogs were trivial ( and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid , but that is not fault of the movie ) . The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series , but who would shoot such series ? What it would be about ? One star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity ."	0
2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.I thought with a cast of James Woods , Cathy Bates , Randy Quaid , Lou Gossett , Jr. , and Henry Thomas - how could it miss . I was wrong.I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week - end he cranked out this piece of dribble . I 'd long suspected Sam S. of being kind of nuts , this film , based on his play , confirms it.This is the kind of artsy b.s . that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . However , for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash , there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie.You have n't seen dysfunctional families until you 've seen this bunch . Pa is crazy , Ma is crazy , the son is crazy and the daughter is , oh yeah , crazy . They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush , especially the teenage daughter.In addition to the above , as if that were n't enough , the plot -- and it 's so thin you could read thorough it -- has a hole in it the size of Alaska.Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . As it turns out so is Pa. Now I do n't claim to be a real estate expert , but the last time I checked , property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . If only one of them owned the property , then the other could not legally sell it , so it would be pointless for that person to do so . Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact , and therefore , his plot does not work.Not that anything else was really working anyway.The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity , and I ca n't imagine why anyone would want to .	0
"... and in * no way * as clean , logical , and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27 , and I 've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations . Like the main character in the film , I was successful mainly because of logic : because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality , and to know what was really going on and what was n't . In the end , I was really successful because of medication , by the way , but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So , I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud . Not only does it cheat with the main character 's story ( who was n't faithful to his wife , who was bisexual - something really important here ) , but mostly , it shows a comforting , tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure , not a disease . A schizophrenic * is n't * a "" normal man with a disease "" , it 's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him , things like time , space , and people 's personalities are n't solid things . He feels it can be bent , it can change , it can mutate , and maybe even disappear . To cope with this , a schizophrenic has a rich , very imaginative inner world which "" normal "" people do n't expect - but he 's trapped in it because he ca n't relate with most people , and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank , delusive dead end.This is very different to what 's depicted in this ridiculous "" cure "" , tear - jerking movie . It should be violently frightening . People other than the main character should appear strange , weird and absurd , like in Lynch 's "" Eraserhead "" , for example . There should be * really * impressive , weird , gross hallucinations , because that 's what schizophrenia is all about . It 's not about * details*.I mean , watch "" Naked Lunch "" , "" Lost Highway "" , read P.K. Dick 's "" Martian Time - Split "" or "" Ubik "" , DO watch "" The Cell "" , "" Perfect Blue "" , "" Dark City "" , or play "" American McGee 's Alice "" on PC , and you may have a vague idea of what it 's like . Do n't watch the "" feel good "" movie of the month , with banal situations , cleaned characters and visuals , and stupid plot tricks . "" The Cell "" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic 's mind , his visions and his inner consistency - it 's violent , weird , confusing , and very , very scary.Once again , Schizophrenia is n't about details , it 's not a neat , tame trick played to you . It jumps in your face and wo n't let you go : walls fall apart , people turn into strange hostile creatures , you feel like you go backward in time , you 're not sure you 're who you think you are , everything feels ... strange , unnatural . Believe me , this is much much more than what 's depicted in this soap - like melodrama"	0
This movie is supposed to be taking place in and around Seattle . The , why is Porteau Cove P - R - O - V - I - N - C - I - A - L Park shown ? Provincial parks are in CANADA , and not the United States . The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to ' read ' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop . I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device . A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced . We learn half - way into the movie that this woman works in the District Attorney 's office . Then , in the correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender ! ! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional setting . The director really messed on this one -- this does n't happen in real life . The acting is adequate . The Plot is good . The Cinematography is good . However , the many errors found in the continuity lead to a 3 out of 10 vote .	0
Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non - aggression pact signed in August of 1939 . So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line , the line did n't change until a couple of months later . Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler , Eric Roberts as the youngest son , Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar , a Golden Globe , and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor . Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well . The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against , Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca , Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls , Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy , and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie . Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was . Lukas 's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas 's wife was given to Bette Davis . Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her , but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it . It 's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner , a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days . After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe , Davis Lukas , and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War . They 're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests , a friend of Davis 's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe , a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris . Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas 's anti - fascist background . < br />His suspicions are quite correct , it 's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they 've become . Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there . His health has not been the same since . His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes . Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman 's significant other . Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell , Kurt Katch , Clyde Fillmore , Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count . He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943 , but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls . Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti - fascist classic , Casablanca . < br />Though it 's an item firmly planted in those specific times , Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern anti - fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .	1

The threesome of Bill Boyd , Robert Armstrong , and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers , a working gal who sells salt water taffy . With the outbreak of World War I , the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar . The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going , with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one - liners and ' snappy ' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome . The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U - boat . These sequences are lively and well - filmed , but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy - drama with a flat ending . For fans of the stars only .	0

Set during WWII , Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun - filled fantasy adventure for kids , starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who , with the help of three evacuee children and a ' Professor of Witchcraft ' , thwarts a Nazi invasion.Brilliantly inventive , with loads of laughs , this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters , exciting story and catchy tunes . Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine , the not - quite - perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime , and her three young co - stars ( Cindy O'Callaghan , Roy Snart and Ian Weighill ) are equally impressive as the Cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty Hun.The special effects are somewhat dated , but let 's face it , kids do n't care too much about these things , so long as they are entertained . And entertained , they will be . With some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect , and more genuine movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters , it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism . In fact , only a rather drawn - out musical number set in Portobello Road mars the film 's perfection , but with so much else to enjoy , that can easily be forgiven.And besides , any film featuring UK television legend Bruce Forsyth as a ' Flash ' Harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me .	1
"Oh dear ... as an Englishman , and a small part Welsh , a fan of Anthony Hopkins ' work in the industry ..... to date , I am truly disappointed . < br />You see I am a nobody , who hoped for better . So my comments are as ' straw in the wind ' . But , that 's the point is n't it ? - I have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work . I , a full member of the great unwashed , go to see a movie to be transported to another place . To yes , suspend belief for a brief period . But not to enter a state of total disbelief.Had this been by an unknown author and director , I would guess that this ' production ' would have been castigated into oblivion . Unfortunately , its not , and I was left wide eyed and confused . Having seen some of the rave reviews given this work I am faintly worried .... Perhaps its that I try , without prejudice , to view each movie on its own merits . Regardless of author , director , studio or even the notoriety of the content.My advice , as many before me : Do n't Write and Direct the same production . It is fraught with danger . Movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility.As they say in school reports "" Could and can do better ... """	0
There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan 's ' Ned Kelly ' film did . Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations , and decided to see it for myself . Since then , I have acquired both the video and soundtrack , and have to say that after several viewings , I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film . It is also wonderful to see something Australian ! I appreciate its down to earth quality , that if you ask me is a rarity , as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films . This film proves that you do n't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point . The cast was a bonus , including a variety of well known , and might I add , good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters . It is interesting to note , that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what , and how they only said so many lines . However , if any criticism is due , it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded . In reality , these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history . For example , on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much , much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt , and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film . Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt 's efforts alone , that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery . Yes , this is their interpretation of the story , and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention . I feel that in this case , this is the only limitation . However , I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation . It certainly inspired me to look more closely . So , watch it and decide for yourself . You might not like it at all , that s your opinion , and that s fine . Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience ? For me , I 'd call it a breath of fresh air !	1
This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series , and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection.It took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films . I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date . So I popped this sucker in and sat down.From what I had read on the internet , and realizing the content involved in this film , I was expecting to test my nerves in full force . This ended up not being the case.The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point , and how long a human can tolerate pain.Sounds like one sick flick right ? Wrong . The film fails to shock . This may be because I have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror , but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease.On the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen . Though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence . Including the ripping out of fingernails , intestines thrown at an unconscious woman , and a needle through the eye.Overall I think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it , but I suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one .	1
This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s . They were terrible , but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence . New audiences had rediscovered the pair 's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind - numbing garbage geared to cash in on children 's interest . It was to be expected . But , how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of ... I ca n't even think of a word . I 'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival , but you ca n't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing . The impressionists ( I hesitate to call them actors ) do a Vegas act and that 's where it belongs . The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days , trying to stretch out two - reel ideas for a feature . If this film was someone 's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy , I 'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo 's reputation as senility gone amok . The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE . And , you know , these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie .	0
The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself . I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie I do n't know much about . It 's unfortunate when there are n't many comments for a certain tile , because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast , you do n't get an idea of what to expect . I read the review before watching this title and I do n't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from . Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered , even when the material was not the greatest . I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable . It is n't one of the great all - time classics , but a pleasant and funny diversion - much more than you can hope for in most newer movies . If you are a fan of these stars , you will not be disappointed .	1
I 'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film . But I ca n't understand how this one got made . Who made it ? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film ? Did they do a weekend course at some film school , get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiel 's family one by one until he agreed to be in it ? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend / distant relation doing this out of sheer , misplaced kindness ? I do n't care , do n't want to know . Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it , mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera . Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from Neighbours , there seemed to be absolutely no sound design , the script , the direction and editing were all abysmal , and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I ca n't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film .	0
I love this movie ! 10 out of 10 hands down ! It is that damn good ! I am not much of a fan of movies but I got ta tell you this one opened my eyes . Astounding color and fast energy . I was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the Zoinks ! Film Festival in Boston , and the story really enveloped me from the start . It had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended I wanted more . I hope they make a sequel . That would be fun . My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya . UGH ! She SUCKS ! I 've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance . I do n't what the director was thinking when he cast her . But if you ignore her you ca n't help but give this movie a big ten ! ! !	1
"I really enjoyed the reunion a lot ! I would have rated it a 10 if they had had "" Hassie "" and "" Little Luke "" . There was n't even a mention of where they are today or why they did n't participate in the reunion . They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.Anyway , I was glad that TNN ran the series again ! I had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series ( I may have missed a few episodes ) . Jenny Hanahan"	1
"Reviewed at the Sept 12 , 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival . The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him , but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc . The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager . He soon discovers the real - life market is run by a iron - willed "" 10 Items or Less "" checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega . When Freeman 's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that 'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path.While the film was enjoyable , it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress . There were two extended musical sequences ( One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children 's songs in the car , one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video ) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long.It 's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little . Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well , but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film.They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that . Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no ! ? In the real world it 's the exact opposite.Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits . The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious ! An early bit where Freeman 's chauffeur insists it is Freeman 's voice on a "" Books on Tape "" reading was also pretty funny.The director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q&A after the screening . Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there . Quite a compliment for both Silberling 's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it ."	1
"This movie was so bad it was laughable . I could n't resist watching it though . The plot is standard , the acting quite horrible ( supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors ) . Kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.The headliner who plays "" Kathy "" was just fascinating because I could n't decide if her deadpan , flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting ( I decided it was both ) . This leaves the script to comment on , which was pretty awful . Pat remarks , idiotic decisions , and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie . Maybe this is what was so riveting ; I do n't know . I just watched it to see how bad it could be . ( Actually the dialog does n't even qualify to be called "" cliche ' "" - but it 's almost completely inane.)All in all , very bad , cheaply made movie . The sets , the same scenes ( a house , a building ) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie - in to the action ; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play . A chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school : poorly shot , cheap props , minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the ending . Go figure ."	0
After the initial shock of realizing the guts of Mr Branagh to film this , I was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me . I was not disappointed . So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible . It blew my mind . I always enjoy seeing , or rather listening to , Branagh and it made me wonder ... is this movie dubbed in other countries ? That would be like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa .	1
Real cool , smart movie . I loved Sheedy 's colors , especially the purple car . Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella . I liked Sheedy 's reference to how her face had gotten fatter . The roadside dance scene is brilliant . Really liked this one .	1
"Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors . The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch . Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off . Geez , hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic . I kept wondering why the victim did n't start shouting "" None Shall Pass "" and "" It 's only a flesh wound , I 've had worse "" . It was one of the funniest scenes I 've seen in the past year.The "" gladiator / demon "" was a stitch too . Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable . Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br / >"	0
I did n't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this . Only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this . This is supposed to be a horror movie but there 's only filth in this . The most cool scene is the car accident , with real special effects from the best of hollywood . Avoid this movie at all costs . See this only for studies of how bad can be a movie ................	0
The plot of ' Edison ' was decent , but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen , and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad . < br />Whether it was an emotional scene , an action scene , or even a silent scene , Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it . < br />Do not waste your time watching this film . Do n't even bother downloading it , midget porn would be a much better choice.And Justin , if you 're reading this , stick to music . Even though you 're no good at that , you 've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .	0
I have NOT seen this movie , but I must . Having read all three of Thor Heyerdahl 's books ( Kon Tiki , Ra and Aku Aku ) I am actively looking for a copy of this movie.The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well . Considering that this crew had NO GPS , and only an old fashioned valve ( tube ) radio with a 6-watt output , their voyage was heroic to say the least.Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.I would be interested in buying it .	1
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl . Although I do n't remember much about it , I must say that it was a pretty good show . Also , I do n't think I 've seen every episode . However , if you ask me , it was still a good show . I vaguely remember the theme song . Everyone was ideally cast , the costume design was great . The performances were top - grade , too . I just hope some network brings this series back one day so that I 'll be able to see every episode . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that I 'll always remember this show in my memory forever , even though I do n't think I 've seen every episode . Now , in conclusion , when and if this show is ever brought back on the air , I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good .	1
"As the faux - Russian scientist says two - thirds of the way into the movie , "" I came for the science . "" This pretty much sums up the reason I watched this movie - anything that involves a half - man , half - hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist . Or , as they say in the biz , my girlfriend 's brother had the remote and the rest is history . To say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects . This is 2005 , it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background . Yeah , this was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming "" The Birds "" but in 2005 it just looks low budget . Spare me the cheap attempt at Sci - Fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief.However , having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film , let me tell you again that , as sad as it may sound , this is probably worth your time . If nothing else , it is a tour de force of bad Sci - Fi - worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day.The crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind , but also the ability of "" B "" movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines.This film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions - bad guys always wear sunglasses.If this were n't 2005 , I would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the Cold War . I mean , you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey inserting leaches into Chekhov 's ear.One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike , "" wait for Tom "" as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground . The thing is , Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never - ending banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov , or AK-47 , in layman 's terms.As the mad scientist says near the end of the film , "" my goal is to evolve the human species "" - suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind . The faint Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about ."	0
"What a waste of time and money ! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it "" might be funny "" . WRONG ! This movie is about 90 minutes too long . The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and ca n't get out . The jokes are weak and tired , and not even seeing Wilson 's naked behind can redeem any part of this film . The special effects ..... aren't . I half expected to see the harness and wires holding up Uma in her flying scenes . And when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero 's faster - than - a - speeding - bullet flying or fight scenes , they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely . Wilson 's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office co - worker . The sex scenes were n't sexy and the funny scenes were n't funny . I guess I just expected too much from these actors . None of the characters were really sympathetic , so I ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them . The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G - Girl as teenagers - at least THEY had some chemistry . Overall , a super stinko movie - I would n't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money !"	0
It 's such a shame that because of it 's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football . Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick . The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy , the jokes were laugh out loud funny , and the characters are well acted . Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules , putting in great performances both on and off the pitch . Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess ' worried father , and Jonathan Rhys - Meyers , who was so amazingly evil in ' Ride with the Devil , ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once , making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent ! Even if you do n't like football , go see this film . If anything it 'll make you smile .	1
"I first saw this movie when it was released in the U.S. in 1984 . I have seen it many , many times since . What strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa . Throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal . This continues up to the climax of the film . All these years later my friends and I still love to debate whether or not "" Carmen "" is really stabbed at the end . From the reactions of the other characters , to the stylized murder , it is open to debate . The passion of the dance , the quality of the acting , the love of art , and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that , once again , blends and twists the line between life and art ."	1
"I saw this when it was in the theater , it started out so strong I mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent AT THE time . Now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations , and other related psychological factors . Now as I said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining . It builds to an excellent climax then .... IT ends I mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it , besides being a very poetic description . In my experience , it was just not strong enough . My wife and I were well ... how can I say this ? We were upset , I mean we paid money , invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent . "" We both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly . In fact my wife said it best , it did not end , IT JUST STOPPED !"	0
I hope she can keep acting and directing . She 's surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art . Her work has a rare kind of generosity and her timing is spot - on ! Oy I 'm kvell	1
I had heard ( and read ) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series ( like Entourage , Sopranos or Mad Men ) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One . ( did n't make it past the first six episodes ) < br />The writing was unoriginal , contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing . The dialog felt forced , like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.The characters never developed enough for me to care about them , they were selfish and unappealing . I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother - in - law ( who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator ) and the removal of the Hodes ' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché , I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer 's loyalty.Episode after episode I liked the characters less and could n't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.Add to that I heard that Season Two was n't as good , so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.If you 're a fan of good casting and writing , I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like , unless of course you 're stoned and then all bets are off .	0
"THE JIST : See something else.This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel , but after watching it I ca n't figure out why . The film is definitely original and different . It even has interesting dialogue at times , some cool moments , and a creepy "" noir "" feel . But it just is n't entertaining . It also does n't make a whole lot of sense , in plot but especially in character motivations . I do n't know anyone that behaves like these characters do.This is a difficult movie to take on -- I suggest you do n't accept the challenge ."	1
Brilliant film , the next best film to The Drunken Master ( Jackie Chan ) . I recently bought it on an original VHS and i have n't seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then . The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film ( and many other old fashioned Chinese kung - fu movies ) great . The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic . I have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but Gordon liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Return To The 36th Chamber is played by a different character . It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung - fu .	1
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . That being the case I bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . Alyssa Milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as Poison Ivy , Embrace of the Vampire to name a few , the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . I 've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures serials I saw as a child . I can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though I do n't know if it was their own choosing or not . Please . please do n't renew for another season as enough is enough , Bob	0
"It is cheese . If all you want is a video game , complete with what look like straight - from - the - computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for , this is it . My friend and I actually had a great time seeing it , since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit . This movie REALLY requires heckling.Plot ? There was a plot ? OK , some stupid college or later types get invited to "" the rave of the year "" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ( "" If they 'd only stayed back in Seattle , they would have survived . "" - direct quote , or nearly . ) to attend . They get there and everyone is gone , and the site is somewhat wrecked ( but hey , the keg is still full ! ) . With the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman ( who acted only slightly less tough - and slightly less well - than Cynthia Rothrock ) , they fight lots of zombies ( some which spit acid ) , get an earful of freaky legends , and mostly get killed . That 's about it.It 's not quite as BAD as Demonicus , but not by much , and still better than Severed ( they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle , and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once ) . On the other hand , if you 're expecting a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil , run away ! ! ! run away now!!!OK , some real big questions ( without too many spoilers ) : Since when did Spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the Pacific Northwest ? ? ? ? ? Why is anyone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns , and to whom - CANADA , for crying out loud ? ? ? Why is a rave on an unnamed ( oh , excuse me , it 's called "" isla del muerto "" , shya , right ) San Juan Island - and outdoors , still keeping in mind this is THE PACIFIC NORTHWET . And the rave has about 30 people in attendance - "" the rave of the year , "" my patoot.Lucky thing there 's lots of hatchets around . Lots of them . Everyone has them . Must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.Finally , while the movie started out playing with a little "" parody "" ( with nudges at I Know What You Did and Jaws ) , it did n't carry it through near enough.OK , really finally - when the introductory comments ( in a voice - over , no less ) casually mention that one of the characters "" gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing "" you can be darn sure there 'll be some fencing by the end of the movie . Not GOOD fencing , but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords , anyway ."	0
no comment - stupid movie , acting average or worse ... screenplay - no sense at all ... SKIP IT !	0
This movie does have some great noirish / neorealist visuals , and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood 's sugar - coating , which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film . But some of the scenes go on for much too long ( the wedding , especially ) , and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.The dialog was particularly distracting , and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on . Most of the characters were either Italian - Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties , but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks . Toward the end I was laughing , and not because the filmmakers wanted me to . I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian , and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk . But it absolutely did not work for me.Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason : the main character 's son , born and raised in New York in the 1920 's , suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent . I 'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England.I give this movie an ' A ' for effort and intention , but a considerably lower grade for execution .	0
There are n't enough gay - themed movies and there are n't enough ` coming out ' movies . Every one is a welcome addition to the genre . Although the production values are high(the movie ` looks ' good , Matthias Freihof ( Philipp ) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans ) this is a bad one . It is a period piece : gay life under an oppressive regime(East Berlin , 1989 ) a life that seems 40 years behind the west . In a way we 're seeing our own history ; what it might have been like for gays in the 40 's and 50 's here(it often reminded me of ` Last Exit to Brooklyn : the book not the film).But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman . It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just did n't hack at random . Yes , it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes , life behind the ` Curtain ' was hard for gay people . A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience . A good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming - out movies and not one of the misses .	0
"Eight academy nominations ? It 's beyond belief . I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards . With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway , but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me , and I feel distinctly cheated as a result.So it 's a black comedy is it ? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi 's Honor ? It 's certainly tasteless ( the shooting in the head of a policeman 's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life ) but with the exception of a joke about ' your favourite Mexican cigars ' ( which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years ) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try . There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché does n't constitute humour in my book.Is it a romantic comedy of sorts ? Never . The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia ? Not in a million years . The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd , and it usually just has the feel of a really bad ( and cheap ) Mafia movie . It feels more like a homage than a parody.With one - dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them , the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces . Well it is n't enough ; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression , Jack Nicholson ( repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brando 's padded jowls in The Godfather ? ... Oh ! Who cares ? ... all I know is , it is n't funny).Throw in some slow , plodding direction ( this film drags on for 2 hours ) , some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as ; "" You remember the Camora ? Well we 're far bigger , we 'll track you down wherever you go "" , and clichéd mannerisms and you 'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say "" capiche ? "" . Prizzi 's Honor is far from being Huston 's "" masterpiece "" and is rather a very poor last work . It 's definitely one work in the great director 's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson River ."	0
"Everyone has a first love , and though it is hard to define that feeling when you 're younger , it is there , aching inside you . That is what Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature , a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple , straightforward fashion.Such an approach is especially convenient in this case , as the love story at the film 's core involves two twelve - year olds , and would therefore make any attempts at "" deeper "" analysis seem contrived and pretentious . That they do n't is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non - actors , Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip . The former plays Orked ( already seen as an adult character in Ahmad 's previous picture , Gubra ) , a lively , almost rebellious girl who , perhaps influenced by her "" British "" upbringing ( her mother studied in England ) , despises playing with dolls , preferring to play violent sports with the boys . Then one day she meets Mukhsin ( Naswip ) , who has come to spend the holidays at his aunt 's house , and all of a sudden she changes her habits : goodbye fistfights , hello bike - riding and tree - climbing . But what does this mean ? Are they just friends , or is something more implied , something neither of them is yet ready to understand , let alone accept?Given the young age of the protagonists , answering those questions borders on impossible , and so , like in several "" smaller "" films ( Lost in Translation comes to mind ) , there is no real closure , a choice that leaves a bittersweet , but ultimately satisfying aftertaste : the naturalistic , unfiltered acting ( especially Aryana 's ) gets to the heart almost immediately , and a strong supporting cast ( Orked 's family most of all ) helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing . The down - to - earth approach is n't always that effective ( the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early ) , and it is hard to justify the bizarre Pulp Fiction reference at the start of the feature , but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent Asian cinema ."	1
"Okay . Who was it ? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10 ? Are you tripping of your head on Ecstasy pipes ? There were so many of you . Did you do it for a dare ? Is this some kind of cult ? Or did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times under different names?Before I say anything else , I 'll say this . Just because you do n't understand a film does n't mean that it 's not great . Maybe you 've had a bad day at work , or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then were n't in the mood . Maybe there 's a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just do n't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it . BUT . And this is a very , very big but . The XXL elephant - sized mega - but to end all buts.PLEASE do n't confuse incoherence for complexity , and please do n't confuse this two hour non - squirter for an interesting film . Really . You may think you are pretty smart . You may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure : an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep - like naysayers . Please do n't . You 're embarrassing yourself . < br />Revolver 's a waste of everyone 's time . If you thought about if for a few minutes , you 'd recognise it too . It was a waste of the cast , a waste of the crew , a waste of the caterers , and definitely a waste of the precious minutes ( you ca n't get them back you know ) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable , wretched mess.""No - wait , "" comes a voice in the darkness . "" You just do n't understand . Its NON - LINEAR . That means the story does n't go in a STRAIGHT LINE . This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR . It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions . And anyway - they slated FIGHT CLUB when it first came out - did n't you hear ? -Because they could n't deal with the COMPLEXITY . They 're eating humble pie now . Bet you hate Lynch films too , doncha ? "" < br />Hate to disappoint you , but I am quite a big Lynch fan . I rather like Memento , so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion does n't necessarily fill me with fear . And although I 've only studied it briefly a few years ago , philosophy interests me greatly . I do n't dislike Revolver for these reasons . I dislike it because it purports to be about weighty , big - brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable . I 'm not much of a chess player , but Richie 's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old . I dislike it because the characters , without exception , totally alienated me . "" Aha ! "" cries the Richie apologist . "" Guy is cleverly tipping his hat to Brecht ! "" Just maybe you 're right . I think its more likely that he just ca n't write a decent script for toffee.Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually really instructive . Fight Club has acid - tongued , nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh . Revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one - liners that make your ears bleed . Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened . Revolver has , as far as I can tell , several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because ... well , they do n't make sense . If you keep pulling the rug out from under people , they eventually kick you out of their house . And then they lock all the doors and windows . And they never let you back in . Ever.Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz - phrases . Mostly they are spoken , but often they flash up on the screen with attributions . It 's almost pathological.But what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world . Ultimately its so inconsequential . You do n't care about anything . You do n't understand anything . You go home.Actually , there was a bit I really liked : the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence . He 's great . But I ca n't recommend you see the film just to see him . He 's only in it for a few minutes.Please believe me . It 's horrible ."	0
"Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I 'm still so bored I walk out , that is a stinker ! < br />Karen gets stuck in Paris , and befriends a sissily - handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon . Of course he 's married , ( "" But , cheri , why should that be a problem ? "" ) What could be an interesting clash of cultures is ( believe it or not ) just dull . I walked out . < br />Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left ; but it would have had to have gotten a LOT better to make up for a rotten beginning.My advice , if you find yourself in this , run , do not walk , for the exit . Save your time and your energy . Most assuredly save your money . It 's a shame the production company did n't save its money ."	0
Lost is one of a kind ... its so enchanting and full of suspense , thrill and emotions all at the same time . I have never seen any TV series like this before . It is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay . The actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost in the island myself while watching it . It is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form . The series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island . I am tempted to watch one episode after the other and I highly recommend this series for all the TV show lovers . Watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere .	1
This film had no huge stars in it , but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star . With George Sanders , Reginald Gardner , Harry Carey , Bruce Cabot , Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke , you 'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered . Most of this , I suspect , is because of a second - rate script , as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well - established man at the helm.The film is set in East Africa during WWII -- just before the Americans entered the war . The Brits are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals . One of the white men in the film is a double - dealer -- working for the destruction of the British Empire ! But , lovely Tierney , playing a sultan 's daughter ( ! ) , is out to help save the day for good ol' Britain.American film makers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro - empire films . Nowadays , with changed sensibilities , the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculous -- and it would be hard to root for either side ! Still , in its day , this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the British -- though when seen today , the film suffers from a long - winded script and silly casting . The one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent . Too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk -- losing some of its punch .	0
I do not envy Barry Levinson , Rachel Weisz , Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film . It 's , in one word , boring . Maybe the fact that is too predictable , the more - than - exploited Ben Stiller 's loser role or the not - at - all funny scenes make this film just something to forget . Even Christopher Walken 's appearance finishes in a pathetic way . I was very disappointed . I love Ben Stiller 's acting . I loved it in most of his films , the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad . About Jack Black ... Well , apart from High Fidelity I 've never seen him doing something good . What about School of Rock ? Ooops , frightening .	0

This is a fantastic series first and foremost . It is very well done and very interesting . As a huge WWII buff , I had learned a lot before seeing this series . One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds , comparatively speaking that is . It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today , it is just that most of these men were n't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then . One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver . I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII , but really think only the die - hards ( such as myself ) will want to buy this or watch it more than once . My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts are n't quite as accurate as we now know . Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places . That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR . Overall a fascinating look at WWII and a must see for any serious WWII historian professional or personal alike .	1
Unashamedly ambitious sci - fi from Kerry Conran , for whom this is clearly a labour of love . Unfortunately it 's just not that good . It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score , a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg . The movie also references many pulp sci - fi novels , serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still , Superman , Metropolis , Planet Of The Apes , The Iron Giant , Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me . The film however , fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons : the main being that it 's such a labour of love , so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world , Conran actually forgets about making a movie . There is little to no tension , atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles , dinosaurs and race - against - time set - pieces . Even the noir elements fall flat . This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green - screen just looks like a video game half the time and it 's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards . The actors do n't get to do much either - Jude Law is wooden , Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid , Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it 's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything . It is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday . Nice ending though .	0
Horrible . I see many user comments on how great this show is . It truly is a Wanna - Be - Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff . The jokes are lame as ... and the plot is ridiculous . The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines ( if you can call them that ) . The bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet ( or at least another continent ) . There are obviously reasons that TV companies cancel shows ... and none of then are when shows are doing well . Make sense ? Anyway , steer clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do ... go stand in the rain instead - more fun .	0
"My Comments for VIVAH : - Its a charming , idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao . The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom 's families sleeping on the floor , playing games together , their friendly banter and mutual respect . Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals . Yes , the central romance is naively visualized . But the sneaked - in romantic moments between the to - be - married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism . The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom , on the wedding night , tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries : "" Come let me do your dressing""V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage , beauty of Indian culture , beauty of Indian woman , last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about - to - be - couple waiting to get married .... playing by the rules ! Simple yet Beautiful ; Such a Simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films . Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST . He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION . Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families . I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well . She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance . I also liked the acting of all others for ex . the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash , Alok Nath , Anupam Kher , Shahid 's bro & sis - in - law . It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could . Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya , HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain . The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage / Relationship , Avoiding Courtship , Mutual Respect , Care & Space , Waiting for getting Married "" officially "" , Praying / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah . There 's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film . Some of the folks / audience are already excited after seeing , that they r thinking bout Arranged - Marriage :) That s Success if you ask me . it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress - from - Vivah { Result for a nice performance } has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 ! ! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo , even though Vivah , Shahid or Amrita did n't get any of the film - fare & other awards ; @ least this is news to CHEER about ! ! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride - to - be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way :) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today ! ! Imagine , to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Its no mean achievement ! ! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur ! ! They make a cute couple and their on - screen chemistry reminds me of { SRK - Kajol } or { Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla } ................. < br />Some points that I observed , few of the elements : - # 1 If u notice carefully , Amrita Rao looks so good because she s always wearing traditional dresses . She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film ! ! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early - marriage .... but PREM listens carefully to the step - wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher . Eventually "" Honesty "" & "" Trust "" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita . Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person . But according to what I saw in this film , I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also , Its possible ! ! ! # 3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together . Its unlike most other romantic / wedding - based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing / dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff . But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences : - Characterized by restraint , innocence & respect for the other ! # 4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao . These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters / girl - kids in some parts of India . # 5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes , songs are beautifully pictured ! ! Words like "" Jal"",""praarthana "" e.t.c . are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film :) Personally , I really am fond of many dialogs in this film . # 6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts "" sindhoor "" to Amrita when she s struggling for Life - is terrific . Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE / I - cant - do - without - U ; Its a Hats - Off feeling ! ! ! < br /><br / > * * * In many ways , VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya , DDLJ , Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness / on - screen - chemistry of the LEAD pair :) :) * * * IF U ASK ME : - Along with films like Rang De Basanti , Lage Raho Munnabhai , DOR , CORPORATE and Kabul Express , V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006 . IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time - pass / fuzzy / style / crap movies ! !"	1
"I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema . So after watching the trailer for "" Water Lilies , "" I expected to like this film because I thought I 'd stumbled on something unique : a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "" Beautiful Thing . "" < br />The main characters are young French women 15 years old . Marie is slender , reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way ; Floriane is outgoing , athletic and beautiful ; and Anne is loyal , pudgy and behaviorally immature . The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always simmering in this movie , if not at the surface , then just below it . < br />""Water Lilies , "" however , is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens ; it is about sexual frustration , suffering , ennui , teens working at cross - purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless , mechanical sex . It also proves that screenwriters and film - makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.In the extra features on the "" Lord of the Flies "" DVD , director Peter Brook says , "" French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex , "" meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism . Part of the downfall of this film is film - maker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.""Where is the joy ? "" I asked myself while watching this film . Yes , first love can be painful and frustrating , but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh , life - affirming way . These positive aspects are missing from this movie ; there is no balance.Organically , this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love . But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film . First , what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude ? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema , as evidenced by films like "" The Slingshot ; The Rascals ; The Devil , Probably ; The Little Thief ; Murmur of the Heart ; Friends ; Beau Pere "" and "" Europa , Europa "" ; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "" See , audience , I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude . "" Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would 've been an honest way to go.There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing . What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie ; it is film - maker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane warns Marie she 's about to request something that is "" not normal . "" Marie understandably asks , "" Who cares about being normal ? "" Then Sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie , because Floriane 's request is a phony , derivative and substitute question - not the authentic , heartfelt question the movie , Marie 's character and the viewers who 've invested their time deserve . < br />Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer 's nerves : 1 ) Since when do the French - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits , and with a turtle to boot ? 2 ) What teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that 's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved 's mouth?The three main actresses are promising and , if they find better vehicles for their talents , may become excellent actors . Louise Blachere ( Anne ) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles . Adele Haenel ( Floriane ) could become a leading lady , or a bombshell , or both . Pauline Acquart ( Marie ) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable . In the future , she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.All in all , "" Water Lilies "" was very disappointing . Will an honest film - maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love ! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle - aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with . And yes , to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema ."	0
This Italian semi - horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good , that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes . The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film . The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon , go berserk and seemingly kill them . They show the nudity , but they never really show the murders at this point in the film . Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her . He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one , she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience 's business . After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes , foxes and such . At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely . This movie just did not work for me , it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film . Explaining Evelyn 's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave . Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave , just not under her own power . The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too . I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull .	0
I want to add to the praise for the production of this film , especially the luminous cinematography . Firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery . The film was nominated for ( and won ) a single Oscar - the first given for editing . Mala 's performance is moody , penetrating and powerful .	1
My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky . It started out good , but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous . Most of the acting was poor , with the exception of the little girl , Abbie , who really was terrific . In addition , the dialog was predictable & lame - especially Gideon , the Angel 's . Also , without giving away anything , when one of the characters has a tragedy , she almost appears nonchalant . At first we thought it was ' shock ' , but then we realized that it was just a terrible script . We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart - warming stories , but this movie does n't rise to the occasion of being one . There are so many great ones - do n't waste your time with this horrible movie .	0
"Trying to compare or represent this "" swill "" as anything "" Hitchcockian "" is an out - n - out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Weak acting Weak story Weak script . < br />No real suspense , no thrills . You wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff ... You're left thinking , what the heck was that all about.And please , enough with the movement to make "" alternative lifestyles "" HIP and politically correct!! ... I ca n't recommend this to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the acting is ? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "" Mork "" . But those were MUCH more innocent times ..........."	0
I did not enjoy the film , Joshua , at all . Perhaps it is because I saw another , much better similar film titled Orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it 's really just because this film was not very good . I am going with the ladder . Sure , the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that does n't mean the film could not succeed . It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building , boring , uneventful and really did n't leave me thinking anything more than ' that was n't very good ' when it was all over.At the end , Joshua 's motivations are revealed . I wo n't give that away but the reality is that he did n't really accomplish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother , Abby , disappearing about 3/4th through the movie , all arrows point to her returning home soon . She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua 's Father / Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically . So .. should n't she be coming home soon ? Wo n't Joshua have failed ? Wo n't his Mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his Father soon ? I question the Father since his future is left open ended.At the end of the day , I did n't care about the characters . The evil demon child Joshua was n't really scary . The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring . Suspense fell flat every single time . When it was over I could n't believe I had sat through the whole thing . < br />4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil ' child ' go see Orphan . Now that 's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie .	0
"I must admit , I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it . I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin - off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon - wand.I was wrong!The pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers . The accessibility is marvelous ! Of course , seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot , which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War . ( 58 years before the events of the BSG pilot ) . The pilot also allows for newcomers , clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.Don't be mistaken : "" Caprica "" is not BSG . We are presented with an immersive , cerebral drama dotted by provocative , daring , and controversial ideas . < br />The casting maintains BSG 's standards ; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding . Morales ' portrayal of Joseph Adama , inspired by Olmos ' portrayal of William , gives a wonderful glimpse of William 's heroic father . Stoltz 's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what 's yet to come , RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG 's legacy of first - rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece ."	1
The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza . He shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer , paired with Dorothy Kirsten , soprano of the Metropolitan Opera . Indeed , I dare to say that he performs some songs better than Caruso ( check A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini ) . The MGM art and music departments also did a good job . This movie could be perfect , were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth ; we see that she is trying her best , dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable . Lanza deserved a better leading lady , and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions . Also notice that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza , giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .	1
Sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting , emotional man - helping - man plea , in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed off from each other after the Great War thanks to a new border , leading to disillusionment on the German side , as the French are the bosses . But when a fire begins on the French side , the common decency of the German men lead to assistance , safety and even friendship . This was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade , as a certain man from Pabst 's own side would break that piece and turn the Great War into merely a prelude . But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism , as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant , cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work . Also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions , but real people , with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well . These are ordinary , working - class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man , and in this day of individualist opportunism , I 'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to.(Note : Apparently the ending is cut on most prints , where the French rebuild the mining gate , closing off the men once again . This is a brutal turn of events , and may have made the film a better overall film , but I would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence , so in short , I 'm glad it was clipped . ) { Grade : 8/10 ( B ) / # 7 ( of 11 ) of 1931 }	1

Josh Hartnett 's dead eyes , the thick writing of it , and Harrison Ford being in a buddy - cop comedy ! Here 's 3 reasons to hate it , avoid it , and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.The buddy - cop movies are fun . However their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s . Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than ( Hollywood Homicide).What really did happen to this entertaining formula ? ! Since a whole decade the things had n't been the same . You 'd have a buddy - action stubborn flop after another . I 'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : ( I Spy - 2002 ) , ( National Security - 2003 ) , ( Taxi - 2004 ) , ( Starsky & Hutch - 2004 ) , and the worst of them all yet ( Miami Vice - 2006 ) ! < br />I believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and TV shows during 2 decades already . Add to that , particularly here , the negligent dealing and the dull humor . Actually the matter this time is totally unbearable . Yes , we 've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs , and the background of sinful city , but what else was new ? ! It 's not about cliché ; it 's about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made.The acting , especially from ( Hartnett ) 's side , is terrible . This guy is anything but a comedian ( or actor ! ) . So his character was wanting to revenge for his father 's death ! Revenge on yourself man , he probably died out of watching your acting ! ! . Even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy ( or that 's what they seemed here anyhow ! ) .The directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh , some parts managed to be highly dull ( arresting the black guy through the lack ? ? ) ; it 's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action / comedy ! They did n't utilize Hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm , or even as a place which 's full of shining or fallen stars ( cameos that could 've given it few interesting moments).It 's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars ' glamour , and as being a Buddy - cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non - chemistry on the screen ( one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! Guess who ? ! ) , and a Buddy - Cop destroyer more than movie ! God , do n't make me , or my children , live enough to witness ( Hollywood Homicide  Part 2 ) ! At last , look at Harrison Ford 's performance , he wanted to have a good time , but at least we did n't .	0
I love the newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the storyline with Kate falling for the principal . I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family next . I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad . I have always loved James Garner in everything he does , and it is a credit to his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believe in him as Kate 's Dad . This family is so real and funny . It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died , but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with . But generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun .	1
Of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film . From that point of view it is utter fantasy . But who cares ? It is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with Citizen Kane , Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching . Films like this are worth a hundred Citizen Kanes . It is about what cinema does best : great camera - work , great settings and great performances.The three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented , keeping the best till last.I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and ...	1

"Philip . K. Dickian movie . And a decent one for that matter . Better than the Paycheck ( Woo ) and that abomination called Minority Report ( Spielberg ) . But lets face it , the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me . Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending , and I was regrettably right . But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time . No , not at all . First half ( as already many here have commented ) is awesome . There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future ( we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN ) or is it simply over combining . But the paranoia is there and feeling "" out of joint "" also . Good one ."	0
What a bad , bad film ! ! ! I ca n't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious , amateurish excuse for a real movie ! ! I left the theater before the end , stunned by how bad the direction and camera - work of that movie were ! ! And to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry.At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film - making than anything else.Avoid at all costs . You 'll want your time back ! I know I did .	0
OK so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary : Genie comes out of ghetto boom box , gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes , the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what , shaq sucks at rapping , and i guess that s it.So mainly I laughed , I cried ...... but mainly I laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair.I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh.I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b / c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes.If I had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like Hollywood did n't waste money on making this .	0
If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot , then this film is NOT for you . Nope -- you'll hate it . However , for those who like sweet , slightly screwball comedies , then you 'll have a nice time watching this slight film.Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return . However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit , everyone in the family is thrilled to have company . They dote on him and treat him like one of the family, ... and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter , Debbie Reynolds . That 's really about all the plot there is . But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting . A really nice little curio from the late 1950s .	1
"It takes patience to get through David Lynch 's eccentric , but-- for a change-- life - affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight 's journey , but stick with it . Though it moves as slow as Straight 's John Deere , when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging , the painful regrets and secrets , and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation . Richard Farnsworth caps his career with the year 's most genuine performance , sad and poetic , flinty and caring . And Sissy Spacek matches him as his "" slow "" daughter Rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad . Rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family ."	1
Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific . I have seen Kilmer on The Doors , however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb . Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was kind of slow . Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around . At the same time , the John Holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed . The movie deserves being watched more than once . The seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing .	1
I really enjoyed this episode . Seeing The Flash , Cyborg , Green Arrow , and Aquaman ( even though all he did was swim ) made my eyes widen . To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what i 've been waiting for . This sounds a bit off topic , but making a live action Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode . This is the thrill i got from watching this episode . I wish they had made this episode a little longer , like a two hour special , because i felt that one hour of the Justice League was n't enough . Now before i bore you ( unless i already have with my rambling ) i just want to say , Smallville is cool again . It sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on Lana . But i 'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole . :( So enjoy this episode . Who knows when another good one 's going to come out . Catch it again this Thursday , Feb. 22 , if you missed the first airing .	1
I agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched , and I would also say rushed . It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school . But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it does n't fully make sense . For example Jane & Mr Rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage ! ! ! The actors do n't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . The actors are good but are n't given enough time to do this story justice . I 'm sorry to say it but I did n't really enjoy this version . The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles . I love it so much I watch it regularly . There is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins .	0
This movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof . I was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings , especially when you think that this is Zukovic 's first large scale attempt.One warning , do not take the movie 's message that seriously . It is not for mass consumption ( and that is not a compliment ) . The message is a somewhat stylized post - college , neophyte view of society.I did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious ' zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90 's .	1
"I really wanted to like this western , being a fan of the genre and a fan of "" Buffalo Bill , "" "" Wild Bill Hickok , "" and "" Calamity Jane , "" all of whom are in this story ! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor , and it sounded great . < br />The trouble was ..... it was n't . I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this , being bored to death . Jean Arthur 's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just did not look like nor act like "" Buffalo Bill . "" Cooper was n't at his best , either , sounding too wooden . This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.In a nutshell , his western shot blanks . Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one ."	0
An OK flick , set in Mexico , about a hit - man ( Scott Glenn ) who hitches a ride with struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a hit . He pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand.It starts well enough , but quickly struggles and dies.**SPOILER**The eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe . An absence of passion , and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other , made it ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and dull.**END SPOILER**Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the hit - man 's trail , but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is ...	0
Composed , elegant Carol ( marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke ) , her nice husband Eddie ( likable David Houseman ) , Carol 's wacky , constantly eating best gal pal Anna ( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan ) , and Anna 's hunky , amorous husband Pete ( a typically fine Eric Edwards ) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . Their usual routine gets disrupted when Carol 's lonely , repressed , but still alluring widow mother Jennifer ( a superbly moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles ) drops by for a visit . Pretty soon Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers ' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle , with everyone except Carol eager to seduce her . Writer / director Joe Sarno concocts a sharp , engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70 's sexual revolution ; Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot . Moreover , Sarno elicits uniformly first - rate acting from the bang - up cast : Welles and Brooke are both exceptional , with excellent support from Edwards , Jordan , Houseman , Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara , and Erica Eaton as saucy neighbor Mrs. Fields . Better still , all the women are extremely hot and enticing ; Welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit , but never raunchy or tedious . Stephen Colwell 's bright , polished cinematography and Jack Justis ' bouncy , melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . Recommended viewing for Sarno fans .	1
I first saw this at a foreign film festival . It 's a beautifully paced nail - biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold . It 's all shot in a gritty , grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully ( note : Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).There 's a lot of humor and some romance , too . I do n't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises , so I 'll just say this heist film starts from a great script , and the directing and performances are top notch . DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve - racking example of its genre --- I 'd put it up against RAFIFI , TOPKAPI , and it 's miles ahead of the new OCEAN 'S 11 , though ( deliberately ) not as glossy . RENT OR BUY IT NOW .	1
"Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I 'll never get back on this piece of trash . I heard someone online describe this movie 's villains as "" subhuman cannibals "" , and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent . WRONG ! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline . These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch . This movie is n't so controversial , I 've seen this level of gore in many films . This movie plain sucks . SYNOPSIS : A blonde who thinks she 's real hot ( but she is n't ) , her admirer , and her admirer 's friend ( no , I do n't remember their names ) go into the woods . Their car breaks down . They are warned to leave by a man named Mark . The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they ca n't find the admirer 's friend . Admirer impales his foot ( whoops ! ) . Do n't worry , he is much more upset when his car wo n't start than when he gets impaled by nails . After a nanosecond of coaxing , the blond leaves to find help . Events ensue that I can not remember . During this and throughout the movie , we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag . Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals ( even though all they are seen eating is intestines , which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food ) . Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard ( unsuccessfully ) to work up tears . Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can "" out think them "" . Mark ( the man who warned them to leave ) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family . Then there is some shooting , they leave the house , the shooting continues , then a random guy shows up and says he 's been watching them . Before he is shot , we are shown an acid - trip inspired scene of more killing . The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them . There 's more killing , the admirer professes his love for the blonde . Then a mysterious hand covers the camera . What does that imply ? I do n't know , hopefully not a sequel ."	0
"The movie deserves 2/10 . 1.5 stars for the girl , ( I 'm sorry I 'm biased , i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies ) , and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1 . I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating . I amazed myself being able to sit through it . < br />Lets talk about the plus points of the movie . The girl . Ueto Aya is cute . That s all there is to salvage the whole movie . The fact is , if the main character was male , i am sure that most people ( including me ) would not have touched the movie at all . < br />Now lets talk about the minus points . Firstly , it is real draggy , with lots and lots of repeated scenes . Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back . It seems more like a drama way of shooting . Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks , and this movie too . Secondly , the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting . I do not mind unrealistic movies . But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness , by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs , etc ... it reminds me of Shinobi , though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting . Moreover , to portray "" i - don't - know "" what effect , the director films people dying with blood spraying ( literally ) all around ... people not realizing their head was cut off ... etc .. etc ... etc ... Too many of these spoils the show . It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie . It degrades the show greatly . Thirdly , Is n't Azumi supposed to be an assassin . She seems more like an one - man - army to me , just that she is a female . I do n't think you see assassins charging into army camps . The only time i felt she acted "" assassin - liked "" was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1 . Lastly , the plot was thin in both movies . Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way ."	0
I have seen many , many films from China - and Hong Kong . This is the worst . No , the worst one was ' Unknown Pleasures ' . I watched ' Platform ' yesterday evening and thought that Jia Zhang Ke 's other two films must be better . This evening I was disappointed again . I will not be watching ' Xiao Wu ' tomorrow evening because I have just placed all three films in the bin ! Whoever gave this film , ' Platform ' ten out of ten , needs to watch more cinema ! The photography was very poor : it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close - up work . The storyline was so disjointed that I fast - forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration . I would not recommend this film to anyone . Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day . These are true masters of Chinese cinema , not pretentious con men !	0
"Good luck finding this film to even watch - it 's not yet released on tape or DVD . I saw on release in the early ' 70 's , was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheque 's preservation efforts , and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years.No reason to repeat rwint 's accurate comments here . As a come - out Director soon after the soaring success of Five Easy Pieces , Jack N has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible , and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re - cutting . But it 's also a memorable icon for it 's time : the all very intense clashes of late 60 's college sports , student movements , sexual revolution , and more . < br />Why see this film ? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes : the frisky male bonding in the after - game showers ; Karen Black 's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it 's the first use of a word I had n't witnessed in film before ; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall . There are probably others I 'm omitting.Look for a nice surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films ; a thin David Ogend Stiers ; Mike Warren fresh out of his powder - blue UCLA uniform and readying for a dark - blue TV uniform ; Robert Towne - Actor ; and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves.Now : any connection between Harry Gittes last name , Robert Towne , and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes?It gets a "" 7 "" based on Karen Black . You 'll see why ."	1
As a veteran of many , many pretentious French films I thought I 'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything . But not this . Pointless , relentless , violent , unpleasant , meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art . Avoid at all costs .	0
well , i said it all in the summary , i simpley adore the movie and the cast ... i would give each actor an Oscar ... great , great movie ... i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i wo n't cry and i always do , about 2 or 3 times ... ; ) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant , jeremy irons also .. just brilliant ... i wish the movie received more awards ... i really do n't know anybody who watched it and did n't loved it ... also , glenn close was fantastic ... the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much , and how blanca was close to her parents ...	1
Those familiar with the two previous Cube films pretty much know what they can expect : a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms , paranoia , bad acting ... This one is a bit different though . Roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube , where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube ( or at least five of them).I guess Cube Zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is , but you really do n't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films . Sure , there 's sort of an explanation in there , but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.Cube Zero looks rather cheap ( as did its predecessors ) , and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling . I also fell pretty confident in saying that there 's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future . They have brought back the traps from Cube 1 , though , ( by that I mean that they 're almost the same ones , which is a bit of a shame).I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one , but I just feel that it 's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was n't that great to begin with .

The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie . A blend of the two genres just does n't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere . This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary . If it is meant to be a thriller / drama this is too dull and monotonous . In either case , what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience ? That around us there are people who ill - treat others who are willing to be ill - treated ? That there are many crazy lunatics around us ? So .......... so what ?	0
""" A Thief in the Night "" is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low - budget ( which was obvious ) and its subject matter -- the Rapture of true Christian church and the fate of those left behind . Nevertheless , it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with Jesus Christ . It touched everyone -- showing even a pastor who preached the Word , but did not believe it , knowing exactly why he was left behind . This movie , and its sequel "" Distant Thunder , "" are must see movies . Even with the new "" Left Behind "" series coming out , telling the same story with a much higher budget , the impact is still the same--""A Thief in the Night "" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered ."	1
"I enjoyed this movie . Have n't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . I 've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he 's versatile.I was n't troubled that Dotty 's "" anxiety disorder "" may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . There are zillions of whatever - phobias and neuroses , and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . She is clearly a sensitive with extra - sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos . It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric.Although this is taken to be a light "" family movie "" , it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . Also , Hiram 's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . It 's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance ."	1
This is something new.There 's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it.A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator , mentally unstable , new hitler , etc . without repercussion from the governments side ( like , say , silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods ) . Oh , and they still claim that they are being suppressed , of course.See how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals ( how much more stupid can you get ? ? ) .And see how the people of Venezuela march to the palace , holding the constitution in their hands , and reinstall their elected government.This sounds like a Hollywood fairytale , but it happened for real , against the explicit wishes of the USA . The documentary is a historical masterpiece , shot from the center of the action , acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup : The good , democratic , freedom loving , benevolent USA ( who still channel large amounts of money to Chavez ' political opponents).Also highly entertaining and exciting . 10 points .	1
The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach . Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms . On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.Maybe there 's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we have n't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now . New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green . Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming . For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck . Obviously there 's no family planning in this world either.Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with room mate Edward G. Robinson who 's old enough to remember the Earth before catastrophe struck . There 's been a murder committed , Joseph Cotten an executive with the Soylent Corporation , a multi - national concern that has come up with a food product , some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world 's population . It 's latest product is Soylent Green.The investigation finds Charlton Heston getting his man , but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind . As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people , that we 've become a race of cannibals , the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative . We 've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had differing political views . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia , he passed away in real life . Not many did , but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.Though the timetable was off , it does n't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass . Hopefully we 'll have not just the intelligence , but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening .	1
"I had seen Marion Davies in a couple of movies and really could n't understand her appeal . She could n't dance for peanuts , she did n't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance . But I had n't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful . Rather than kidding her own image , as has been suggested here , to me it seems a satire on Gloria Swanson , who did start off in slapstick comedies , went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up marrying a Count . Marion , a top mimic , also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand , that was Gloria Swanson spot on!!!Colonel Pepper ( Dell Henderson ) has motored all the way from Georgia to Hollywood , determined to prove that his daughter , Peggy , ( Marion Davies ) will be the greatest star ever . Their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet Billy Boone ( William Haines ) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get Peggy a job . Peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic . They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success . Charlie Chaplin asks for her autograph but she does n't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely . "" Who was that short little guy "" - when she finds out she faints ! ! ! Peggy and Billy get a call from High Art Studio but only Peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way . There is a funny scene where she sees a star she does n't think much of - it 's Marion Davies!!!She finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she ca n't cry ! ! ! It is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds , she ca n't stop ! ! ! Her new leading man , Andre ( Paul Ralli ) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - Patricia Pepoire ! ! ! She also seems to have forgotten Billy and her dad - she has developed a "" STAR "" personality ! ! ! When the slapstick studio picks the same location as "" Patricia 's "" movie , Billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude . When she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew . < br />After a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day ) "" Patricia "" gets a call from the Boss . It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old Peggy back . She and Andre decide to get married , she dreams of being a Countess ( even though Billy says that Andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a Count than he is ) . On her wedding day , Billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that Billy is the one for her.It was amazing to see all the guest stars - John Gilbert is seen going through the MGM gates , Lew Cody is talking to Elinor Glynn , who not only wrote "" It "" but several racy romances that were made into MGM movies . William Haines , another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see , was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing . Harry Gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and Marion was at the top of them all - I 'm giving this film 10 out of 10.Highly , Highly Recommended ."	1
"Very bad film . Very , very , very bad film . It 's a rarity , but it defenitly is not worth hunting down . This Italian Jaws rip - off makes little sense most of the time , and no sense the rest .

If it 's at the local video store , you may want to watch it if you 're a fan of monster movies , but it 's not worth hunting down ."	0
Meryl Streep is such a genius . Well , at least as an actress . I know she 's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents , but she nails the accent every time . Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring . Mrs. Chamberlain , as portrayed here , was not particularly likable , nor all that smart . But that just makes Streep 's work all the more remarkable . I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations . About the film , well , there were a couple of interesting things . I do n't know much about Australia , but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story . I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago , but it came through loud and clear yesterday . And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery - inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues . A pretty good film . A bit different . Grade : B	1
Perhaps I would have liked this film more if I was n't so attached to the characters in Henry Fool . To those who 've never seen Henry Fool , I would n't worry . As Hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at TIFF , the film has lots of exposition and explanations.This film is very heavy in plot , which keeps the film moving . There are many humorous moments and the film certainly has Hartley 's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue . Over all , a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of Hartley who are just beginning explore his work . As for the older fans who loved his earlier works like Trust and Amateur , this film could go either way . I have mixed feelings about the film and Hartley 's later films in general . What Hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations , focusing on the intimate and idiosyncratic ways in which his characters interact with each other . Since his late 90s and onward , his films have widened in scope in terms of subject matter . Mass media in No Such Thing , Religion in the Book of Life and now Terrorism in Fay Grim . I do n't know if Hartley 's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he 's able to do it justice.Strangely enough , the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships , a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves . The only problem is , I 've seen Henry Fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film . You can tell this film was written long after Henry Fool was finished without any intention of a sequel . Somehow , the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of Henry 's books of confessions as a macguffin ( in the hitchcockian sense ) . Fay 's motivations for finding Henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in Henry Fool.I guess I 'm slightly disappointed in the film because it 's not true to the characters in the Henry Fool and it does n't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller . There 's too much irony and wryness in Hartley 's approach to such as big topic as terrorism . It somehow works and does n't work at the same time . All I could say , you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on Hartley 's work and how well you know Hartley 's work . Fans of Henry Fool , be severely warned for a disappointment . For the rest , welcome to the world of Hal Hartley and enjoy the ride .	1
Honestly I ca n't understand why this movie rates so well here , nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his finest film . I 'm a huge fan of Bakshi 's earlier work - particularly ' Heavy Traffic ' and ' Wizards ' , but frankly ' Wizards ' ( 1977 ) was the last good film he made . After that he turned to the mainstream , beginning with the diabolical ' Lord of the Rings ' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta , for ' Fire and Ice'.What can I say ? The story is puerile , the animation is TV quality - I insist that it 's considerably worse than his 70 's stuff - and whereas ' Wizards ' had real imagination , quirkiness , some gorgeous background art , and an underground , adult sensibility , ' Fire and Ice ' is just designed for 14 year old boys , and has the intellectual clout of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.Yes , if you liked the Gor books , you might like this . In my view though , this was just another blip in the slide in quality after ' Wizards ' from which Bakshi never recovered ( though he 's done some decent TV stuff fairly recently)4.5 out of 10	0
This is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen . I rented it as a joke , expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes , and let me just say I 've never laughed so hard in my life . The first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life . This is not a dinosaur movie , but more a movie that makes fun ( and does n't mean to at all ) of the action genre . I did n't see the first two , but judging by the complexity of the plot , I do n't think there 's to much I missed . If you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy , than I insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours	0
"After seeing "" Driven "" on a plane flight to America 3 years ago I truly believed I had seen the worst film ever created , and I could relax safe in the knowledge I would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again . Unfortunately as I found out last night this was not the case . Revolver is so monstrously bad I am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it , just so I do n't feel like I 'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this . Its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant , and I mean CONSTANT voice overs of the main characters , with totally inane pretentious nonsense ! I was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to Andre Benjamin 's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film , whilst all the time thinking - what would Turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster / con man , whatever he 's supposed to be , when he made his "" offer "" ? I 'll tell you what . He would have told him to f**k off , blown his head away , and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him . I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jake 's head when they offer him their "" solution "" to his problem ? They 're con men , therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases ! I mean ffs . Does n't he start to wonder why his symptoms are n't getting worse ? Does n't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of Richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from Avi to Jake to let him know he 's been conned . < br />Anyway , I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides , thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films  . bulls**t ! This film does n't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines , oh no . It somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny I genuinely did n't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can get , and not 1 person so much as smiled . Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny , and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy , but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask ? The unnecessarily baffling plot ! ? ? I sincerely hope not!By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end . It was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over , and they were free from their torment!I'll round this off ( I 've got to finish , writing this is making me angry again ) by elaborating on the "" end "" . I mean sh**t ! The ending  .. no , sorry I ca n't , your just going to have to go and see it . It ca n't be put in words , it just ca n't , and after you 've seen it you 'll know why . Uuhhhhh  shudders "	0
"Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson 's alter - ego Elvira , then this is a good place to start.""Elvira , Mistress of the Dark "" starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message . It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will . Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas , she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money.Unfortunately , the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell , Massachusetts . Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down , she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things : a house , a dog and a cookbook . The town residents have mixed reactions : the teens like her , the women hate her , and the men lust after her ( Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community ) . Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent ( W. Morgan Sheppard ) , because he wants her cookbook . Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock.The film is actually pretty funny , with Peterson a.k.a . Elvira using her "" endowments "" and sexiness as a joke ( "" And do n't forget , tomorrow we 're showing the head with two things ... I mean the thing with two heads "" ) . Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah , the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line , but ends up looking ridiculous ( The picnic scene is the perfect example ) . Deserves a peek ( The film , not her boobs , of course ) ."	1
Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children , so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet , the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil itself.Although the story is a bit silly , it never quite feels corny , despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film ; Charles Dance off - sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage.The Golden Child is very funny , action packed and really quite compelling in a charming , almost magical way.7/10 Great for all generations .	1

At the end of the movie .... it rains . I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie ."	0
"Rene Clair 's groundbreaking musical . If you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place . This is the story of a starving young artist who finds he 's won the lottery just as his creditors come calling . Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat , which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then ... oh but that would be telling.This is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung ( most people think this did n't happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber ) . Its the sort of movie that they do n't make any more , and rarely did when they did . Its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later . Clair moves his camera around in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing ( though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since Berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through "" the real world "" ) . Its an amazing little movie . and its a charming movie that will just make you smile . Its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment.I'm sorry I ca n't say more . Its just a nice little movie and that s really all you need to know ."	1
"In addition to being an extremely fun movie , may I add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful . This kind , fun loving woman had a great deal of money . Unfortunately , she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money . This woman was lonely since the death of her husband . He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down . To prevent that , she bought it . Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away "" their "" money and decided to take action . The character actors in this film were a great plus also . I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library , but as of yet , it 's never been released . Sad ."	1
Well it 's been a long year and I 'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004 . Panaghoy Sa Suba ( Call of The River ) placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival . As expected , it did n't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen . I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and director . His great vision and creativity really helped this film . He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film . Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio . She did a great job portraying Bikay , the younger sister of Duroy . I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres . I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well . The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.In terms of the story I feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film . I certainly wo n't be raving about the story of this film .	1
Are we really making ' video nasties ' again ? In the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8MM , this is quite a ride . Unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of Paris , Hamburg and Amsterdam . I am however being rather churlish for the ' depraved ' scenes , including everything from , hot wax , harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning , beheading and some . These scenes are immaculate and it 's a pity Bruno and his budget could n't stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures .	1
"These days Spielberg 's "" The Color Purple "" is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning zilch . What 's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was n't even nominated for Best Director . Needless to say , the film - makers deserved more acclaim than they were accorded.The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson ( Whoopi Goldberg ) , an African - American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband . The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie 's relationships with the women around her . It 's told from a decidedly female perspective but you need n't fear that it 's a saccharine ' chick flick'.The story is an interesting one , livened with humour at times although the central character 's struggles are paramount . Some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the film 's end but I did n't mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyes.The film received three Oscar nominations for acting : Whoopi Goldberg ( Best Actress ) , Oprah Winfrey ( Best Supporting Actress ) and Margaret Avery ( Best Supporting Actress ) . I think that Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was unaccountably stiffed.As already mentioned , Spielberg did n't receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts . Such an omission beggars belief , since Spielberg 's direction here is top - notch . I 'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones 's score but it 's not below average by any means.In the end , the story is a satisfying one , well - told by a master film - maker working from Pulitzer Prize - winning material . Give it a try and you 'll probably be as baffled as I am about how it could be so poorly treated on Oscar night ."	1
"Dick Foran and Peggy Moran , who were so good together in THE MUMMY 'S HAND , return for this very minor Universal Horror offering . But this time , instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick "" Babe , "" we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named "" Stuff "" . But the results are nowhere near as charming , and the scare level is virtually nil.Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as "" The Phantom "" who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself.This "" phantom "" is not very mysterious , and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . It 's always nice to see perky Moran , but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal 's instantly forgettable misfires ."	0

But < br />characters come and go for no apparent reason , continuity is < br />non - existent , and the acting , cinematography , and direction are ( to < br />put it politely ) amateurish .

Damn , was that a lot to take in . I was pretty much mesmerised throughout . It was pretty perfect , though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that . I ca n't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them ( Anton especially ) to get all of this footage without any serious ... beef . The Dandy 's did come off well - together , middle - class kids who took advantage of their situation ( and rightly so ! ) . I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton , which maybe was n't what a lot of other people felt . Great piece of film - making and great choice of subject(s ) . I recommend this to any music / film fan . You 'll probably learn something about film - making .	1
"REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES ( 2 outta 5 stars ) No , this is not a long - lost ancestor to the classic George A. Romero zombie flicks . This is a low - budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time ... but seems awfully routine these days . There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close - up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them . The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I 'm sure it had audiences gasping . The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control ... ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves . The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail 's pace so it seems feature - length , believe me ! There really is n't much to recommend it ... you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star "" wading "" through a "" swamp "" . The ending is interesting ... so I 'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once . More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap "" 4 movies on 1 DVD "" compilation at Wal - Mart for five bucks . Hey , it 's well worth the money ..."	0
This is a great film . Touching and strong . The direction is without question breathless . Good work to the team . I feel so sorry for Marlene , By the grace of God go you or I	1
I love and admire the Farrelly brothers ! How come I only got to see this great movie 3 years after it 's release ? It made me laugh , it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart . Big Time . It 's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway:The cast is excellent throughout - from the lead- to the supporting roles , the acting is great , the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited.I think that the Farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they 're deeeeeep ! They talk about what life is all about ( I wo n't tell YOU!).In my case , this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about:If you love somebody : Set them free , let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other.I'm not a sports - hater , but definitely a sports ignorant . But in this movie - the vibes get you . I could smell the atmosphere of Baseball . Finally , this movie explained to me what being a sports - fan can mean to you and what cool fan - families there must be out there.Thanks so much , Pete & Bob!P.S. : If you have n't seen it - please check out KINGPIN !	1
"Why every horror director wants to imitate "" The Exorcist "" is a complete riddle to me , as William Friedkin 's "" classic "" is a very overrated film and , in my opinion , not all that tense or shocking . And yet here 's another clean rip - off , a Spanish one this time , that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family . Paul Naschy ( who I must admit looks quite hot here ) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila 's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend . At first the priest does n't believe it but when John 's body is discovered with its neck twisted , Leila 's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "" Exorcism "" is not only very unoriginal , it 's also an insufferably boring film ! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore , and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that 'll nearly put you to sleep ! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments , albeit very stupid , and there 's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze . The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money . This is just an awful film , end of story . Other European "" The Excorcist "" rip - offs are "" The Antichrist "" and "" Beyond the Door "" and they suck as well !"	0
This is a great movie ! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park , where the Chaos Theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly 's wings , causing a tornado on the other side of the planet . Well , Bug is all about that ( or at least something , do n't worry this is no spoiler ) I 'm definitely not a religious type and do n't believe in pre - destined stuff , fate , etc , but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists ... further more , the acting and camera are excellent too , another prove that it 's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks	1
"Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake , "" The Money Pit . "" Older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia : Cary Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas were all "" superstars "" in an easier , less complicated era . Or was it ? Time , of course , has a way of modifying perspectives , and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary , there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older , seemingly less provocative films . In "" Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House , "" there may , therefore , be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 . There is political commentary , however subtle . Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience , only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like . Politics in the movie ? The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school ( which in real life would get teachers accused of communism ) . In real life , too , Myrna Loy was a housing activist , a Democrat , and a feminist . Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand : he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas , whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism ( and which ruined her ) . Jason Robards , sr . , has a small role in the film , but his political activism was no less noticeable . More importantly , his son , Jason Robards , jr . , would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat . Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant , whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping . But this was 1948 : Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner . It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films , and then not so subtly ."	1
"Certainly NOMAD has some of the best horse riding scenes , swordplay , and scrumptious landscape cinematography you 'll likely see , but this is n't what makes a film good . It helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things . And that 's where Nomad wanders.The story is stilted , giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a "" cool "" movie that "" looks "" great . Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place ( and it 's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez ) . If movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks , they damn well better use actors / actresses that look the part.Warring tribes , a prophecy , brotherly love and respect , a love interest that separates our "" heroes "" , are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence , the next action horse scene , or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during its filming , specifically the director and cinematographer . Ivan Passer ( director ) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov , and Ueli Steiger ( cinematographer ) was replaced by Dan Laustsen . In one respect , Laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here . Definitely a good thing . However , the changing over to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice . From what I 'm seeing here , the focus is on the battles and not the people , which I sense comes from Bodrov 's eyes and not Passer 's . A true travesty.The most shameful aspect is that this could 've been a really fantastic film , with both character and action focuses . Unfortunately , the higher - ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap ( intellectually speaking ) way out.Even though I ca n't give this film a positive rating , it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work . But that 's all ."	0
"Cut tries to be like most post - Scream slashers tried to be , a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies . Now , I am not bagging ' Scream , ' as I think ' Scream ' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy . Cut fails on most levels . It has its moments but overall it just does not work out , not even as a "" so bad it 's good "" movie , just a below average one.The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well , apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue ca n't really act , and ironically she gets her tongue out , go figure . Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off , which is apparently cursed . And , as you have probably predicted , one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.Unoriginal plot , poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow . There is plenty of referencing in the film , everything from ' Scream ' to ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . ' This is n't smart either , it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream . For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity , which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it . Really , I should be supporting this movie because I 'm Australian and we 're not as good when it comes to horror ( we do have our gems , though ) but Cut is definitely not one of them.However , it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so , so that is something good at least . I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans , who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for , but if you are looking for a good movie , stay away.2/5"	0
"Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ) , only more so . There 's more of everything , more animals , more varied African tribes , and scenes in which the thought must be , if this was good with three or four lions , forty would be better . Tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin , around and around , jaws flapping . Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . His friends are real chimps , people wearing larger ape costumes , and elephants . In fact , they use Indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than African oneswith costume ears attached to their heads . The human story : another white man , worse than the rest , shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . Tarzan wo n't show them the way , so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . Tarzan intercedes , and the bad guy shoots himbut , of course , he survives and returns to save Jane . Everybody else dies , Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their "" boys . "" People are expendable , especially Africans , and there does n't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes . There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . Apparently one of Weismuller 's friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not Maureen O'Sullivan . She , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . They still do n't need to talk a lot . They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . No wonder they 're happy ."	1
Jörg Buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times , even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify . They are artistically made , with also often deeper meaning to its themes . This movie is a perfect example of his work.It 's also really hard to label this movie . It 's not really a movie with a story to it , in a sense of having a beginning , middle and end in it . It also does n't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings , on 7 different days.All different stories are being told with lots of class , though some of them are of course more ' interesting ' and realistic than the others . They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story . The movie does n't feel disjointed at all . All different stories have a different feel to it and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words ( also typical for his style ) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story . It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch.Again , the production values all are n't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people . It however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark , disturbing and depressing themes.A Buttgereit movie that I ' enjoyed ' watching.7/10	1
As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite , this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man 's point of view . If you 've never watched this show , you 're in for an extended treat . Yes , there is violence and nudity , but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano , the thinking man 's gangster , with the reality of the life he has been born to and , quite frankly , would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up . Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist , then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage , and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew , take a break , sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar , and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football . Even Carmella , his wife , when given a chance for a way out , finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own . If you followed the whole thing , you know how it ends . If you did n't , trust me you 've never seen a TV show end like this .	1
It 's this sort of movie that you try and imitate . By attempting to realise something ... then flying through the air almost immediately . I 'd like to do that and I know you would too!Great stuff !	1
This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in , effected by , or suffering from an eating disorder . It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl , its causes and its symptoms . The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today , Alison Lohman , who was later so spectacular in ' Where the Truth Lies ' . I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools , as you will never see a better on this subject . Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding , and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder . If barometers tell us the air pressure , Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy . Her emotional range is so precise , each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma , on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity . Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother , and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman 's . Together , they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another . This film is really an astonishing achievement , and director Katt Shea should be proud of it . The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people . But even if you like nature films best , this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge . Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair . And if we do n't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair , then we are dead inside .	1
I would almost give it 10 out of 10 . However , there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss - leading which hurt the flow / continuity of the film . The story line is great and well composed ; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it . The characters are complicated and so is the story line , expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head , it 's a film where all is explained in the end . The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else I 've seen in animation . It is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it 's worth watching it on a good T.V , or plasma . The character voices do save this film in its English version , but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that its happening Paris , I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles . One the whole its well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it ! And personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like ; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence , this is just a personal suggestion .	1
Maybe the movie itself is n't one of the best Jackie Chan 's movies , but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made . There also was some memorable stunts , which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic . This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film ( like they could remake that chase scene , I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better ) . There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie was n't fighting . Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film .	1
"I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy - of - ills . With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s , "" Norman "" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings , not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers ! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark , this tale of an estranged married couple ( Foxx and Pearl Bailey ) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay -- and living with a mincing , prancing white homosexual -- has enough limp - wristed jokes to shame any early episode of "" Three 's Company "" . Bailey keeps her dignity , and Foxx 's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles , but the rest of the performers are humiliated . * from * * * *"	0
This is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago . It connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered.Clothes and music might have changed over time , but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up - to - dateness . And especially this movie does the job pretty well . Of course it is cheesy at times , but very touching as well.Jodie Foster 's performance is striking , and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies.Don't miss this one .	1
"There 's something frustrating about watching a movie like ' Murder By Numers ' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out . However , by the time the credits roll , there 's no saving it . The whole thing is pretty much blown by the "" cop side "" of the story , where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin 's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on . Although Bullock is strong in her role , it 's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing . Ben Chaplin 's talents are wasted in a forgettable role ( he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated ' Birthday Girl ' ) as well as Chris Penn , who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him . Anyway , the plot really is n't even a factor in this movie at all . The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie . Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well . It 's too bad they were n't in a much better all - around film . Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker . Bottom Line : it 's worth a rent if you 're a genre fan , but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it , except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks ."	0
In the mid-1930s Hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition . Although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly , it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look , how they should be structured and how they should be acted . The Informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story , asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue.This is not to say the Informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents . For one thing , many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative , and were overburdened with title cards . But what the Informer has is the self - assuredness to extend moments between dialogues , to focus on reactions more than speeches , and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere.Director John Ford , for all his capability , was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material . If he thought a story was silly , he just did it half - arsed . Luckily the Informer , with its depiction of community , honour , working class life and most importantly Irish setting , was everything Ford loved , and the result is one of his finest works . In it , Ford only really employs too kinds of shot . The first is of places  the Dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths can not be seen ; dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us . The second is of faces , striking close - ups against plain backgrounds , usually without dialogue , focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people.Lead man Victor McLaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him . McLaglen 's performance does not look like much , being as it is about 90 % drunk act . But the other 10 % is heartfelt emoting , as here and there his Gypo Nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity . With such performances are Oscars won . McLaglen is backed by a spot - on supporting cast , among whom there are no weak links . In particular it is nice to have Donald Meek and Una O'Connor , usually only seen in comic relief roles , playing straight dramatic parts for once ( although Meek 's appearance does contain one or two jokes , the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious ) . Not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances , their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy.RKO , who produced the Informer , were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios . Thanks to this , we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti - hero at its centre , which could easily have been a clunky , over - earnest mess , instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world .	1

With all of the violence on TV and in the local news , it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language , yet is still entertaining . My children look forward to watching with us every week . Each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judges . We all enjoy Elton Brown . We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient , unique vegetables and seasonings . We play along at home to guess who the winner will be.It is a great hour of entertainment , as well as informational . Best of all in our hussle , bussle life , it is an hour the family spends together .	1
"This low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places -- writing and acting . In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far . In low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but , surprising , it rivals film stock for brightness , clarity , and , saturation in brightly lit situations . This is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a "" Midnight Cowboy "" kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban San Francisco ."	1
"The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is pretty far down on the list . When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after World War I , one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions . And he succeeds , at least at first . A love triangle complicates the story some.This really was a tedious movie , with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who were n't . The dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable ( not the zombie part of it but parts related to the "" romance "" ) . And while I am not any student or expert on cinematography , the camera work did n't seem to help the film much either.While I have seen a few movies that are worse , this is unlikely to please anyone . It 's bad , and NOT in a so - bad - that - it - is - good kind of way ."	0
The Unborn is a very , very different film . James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the film and they performed quite well . this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going . Though I think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot . There is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me that 's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that 's it when it comes to that . There is a scene where Adams ' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real . The music is very different but very good . The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film that 's superbly unpredictable and that 's quite strange ! I recommend all horror fans to this movie !	1
Johnnie To 's ELECTION has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits ' design too , a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff ; as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored . I have found about To from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was quite eager to see a To movie . The one with which I began , ELECTION , is exciting and interesting , and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent ; the story of an Asian godfather 's scheming , it uses a puzzle play of elements , violent facts from the mobsters ' lives , the race for the scepter , true details , and as with Coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable . The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful.ELECTION is well made in the enjoyable , somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong fare ; the ending is bitter , true , straight and will scare the kids .	1
A fantastic Arabian adventure . A former king , Ahmad , and his best friend , the thief Abu ( played by Sabu of Black Narcissus ) search for Ahmad 's love interest , who has been stolen by the new king , Jaffar ( Conrad Veidt ) . There 's hardly a down moment here . It 's always inventing new adventures for the heroes . Personally , I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring ( there 's no need to ask why John Justin , who plays Ahmad , is listed fourth in the credits ) . Conrad Veidt , always a fun actor , makes a great villain , and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves , who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra , the father of the princess . He collects amazing toys from around the world . Jaffar bribes him for his daughter 's hand with a mechanical flying horse . This probably would count as one of the great children 's films of all time , but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together . And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time , Willis O'Brien 's stop - motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does n't even look remotely like a spider . 8/10 .	1
I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it . I was in year 10 ( and aged 15 ) so that may have has something to do with it . But for English this year , year 11 , we had to read Animal Farm , also by George Orwell . Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution , my opinion is that it is a terrible book , and I also hated it.But 1984 , I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen , and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet . I 'm sorry to everyone who loved his work , but I unfortunately did not . The themes in the movie were well portrayed , but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards . This is only my opinion , and I 'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film .	0
"Absolutely dreadful Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works , etc ... When our hero , Gaston , is given the grand show by Dr. Maillard , head of the asylum , we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific , such as men hanging around long in a dungeon , and comedic , such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building . Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both : a human man dressed as a chicken , yes , that 's right a chicken , that pecks around the ground for chicken feed . The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film , but , at least for me , it was the film 's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining . Ah ! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes . And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem . Yes , this is obvious , but some have distribution problems and others , of which this is one , have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once . This is definitely garbage . It has very little going for it . The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum . He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally , bellows orders , sashays with sword in hand , and praises the chicken . I got so tired of hearing him talk about the "" soothing system "" as his means to cure the mentally sick . What a bunch of ludicrosity(Hey , a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word ) . It wo n't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting . Cinematic chicken scratch !"	0
Just a regular Jason lee movie , There were some parts of the movie that were funny . The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess . These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties . It was an all right movie . It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention . I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot . Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie . This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central . I am glad that I did n't see this movie in the theater , I would have been angry . But I guess that 's why I did n't see it in the theater .	0
"I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival , with the great Dr. Uwe Boll in attendance.The film is , simply put , very , very bad . And no , not in the usual Uwe Boll "" so bad it 's actually entertaining "" way , but just plain bad . The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life ( because of a past criminal record , apparently ) , ca n't get a job , and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife . This man turns to his cult - leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus . Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys , and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.The acting is awful ( except for Dave Foley , who really tries , despite it all ) , the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion , and people taking a poo . It 's supposed to be satire , but I 'm not sure of what.Think "" Airplane ! "" , but done by the creators of South Park , and without any jokes ."	0
Three flash - backs introduce the main characters ( Abu , Jaffar , and the Princess ) who will interact with Ahmad ; three are the songs , each linked to those same characters . Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word ' Time ' , in his declaration of love to the Princess , answering her three questions at their first of three meetings . So strong is the impression he causes , that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys : deceit , hypnosis , and memory erasing . Yet , Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman : the whip , the power , and the sword . Three is the number of flying entities : the mechanical - horse , the Genie , and the The Genie and the magic carpet . The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters ; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges , and three are his considerations about human frailty , before he departs . Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn ( armed guards , giant - spider , and giant - octopus ) . Three are the instruments of justice : the magical eye that shows Abu the future , the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess , and the bow - and - arrow to execute Jaffar . There 's magic in the number three , and there is magic in this movie .	1
"Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed , this film was a disappointment . Yes , it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud , boredom and frustration of the grunt , but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that 's ALL there is to this movie . There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous . It 's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute . One of the best World War II films , "" Twelve O'Clock High , "" has very little action . But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension . The exception to "" The Story of G.I. Joe "" is a brief battle segment ( titled "" city under siege "" on the DVD ) which takes place in Italy . Admittedly it is one of the most fast - paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie . But alas , the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight . Another turn - off is Pvt . Dondaro , played by Wally Cassell , who is meant to be a "" romeo "" but comes off a pervert . By contrast , Sgt . Warnicki is a sympathetic , if flawed , man . As he says to Capt . Walker ( Mitchum ) when volunteering for another patrol : "" Every step forward is a step closer ... to home . "" But that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink . Too bad the rest of the movie does n't do justice to some otherwise fine touches . As for Meredith 's portrayal of Pyle ... it is practically comatose ."	0
"I being of Puertorican descent , had mixed fillings about this "" documentary "" . First I was offended that Ms. Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra . Also just a point of fact , Mr . John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent . His parents came from Columbia . Whomever did research on this was not very accurate . I feel that the future of our race rests on education . This message should have been resounding throughout this film , Education is our road to freedom and power I think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus . In my opinion , this film swayed toward an anti - American sentiment ."	0
"the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable , but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it . keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production "" i bet you will "" that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production "" supersize me "" i did not had my hopes up high . sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less . as with "" supersize me "" after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was . the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re - repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie , so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end ."	0
"The NSA , CIA , FBI , FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people . ( as MST3k Commentary states it ... ""Sanata has the dirt on every ! Santa 's Tentacles reach far and wide ! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization"")From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything . Its amazing that the CIA does n't have Santa on the payroll . < br />Satan 's dance routine is hilarious . Pitch ... he is so useless.The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous . Very low budget but so fun to watch . I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.You even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor ."	0
Otto Preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip - side of LAURA ... while that film was glitzy and features the high fa - luting Clifton Webb , this film is a whole lot seamier . Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves . Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked . Andrews is quite fine ( a lot less wooden than he 's been in the past ) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful ! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim . WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion - piece to Preminger 's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL ( also starring Tierney ) .	1
i watched this tape , immediately rewound it , watched it again and laughed twice as hard . I strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of , but uncomfortable around transvestites . It shows you that transvestitism is a feature , rather than the entirety of one 's being . The comedy is not single issue . This man is brilliant . All comics should aspire to his level of candor , intelligence and talent .	1
"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a "" thumbs in the middle "" review , remarking that I 'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode . I 've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006 . And as a lifelong Batman fanatic , I can say without hesitation : this show is utter crap.Everything 's wrong with it . Everything . Getting past just the lousy animation and design , the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.And for God 's sake ... is it just me , or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ? ? Is Gotham that much of a revolving - door justice system ? Or , again , is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains ( see "" no character development "" , above).And to make matters worse , every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.1 ) Joker gasses people.2 ) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.3 ) Batman saves the day.Pfeh.There was one episode I saw that was n't a Joker story . The title escapes me , but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster ... the "" Think Thank Thunk "" episode with the quiz show . That was the single - worst Batman story I 've ever seen , heard or read . Yes , worse than "" I 've Got Batman in My Basement . "" < br />I ca n't really say what I feel this show is because it 's probably against the ToS , but it starts with "" B "" and rhymes with "" fastardization "" . Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm / Dini / etc . era of Bat - entertainment , back from the Fox and Kids WB days . Stuff that good , and I should have known this , just could n't possibly have lasted forever , unfortunately ."	0
Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable AND WORSE OF ALL a bizarre almost Hollywood - like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie ( this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!).YOu will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones . The conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided . I did n't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner , is he / she trying to be racist?A truly bizare movie . Only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened.But on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent .	0
I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many , but this was simply not a very good attempt . Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen , and doubt I will . It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot , lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance / character from its supposed male lead ( Jimmy Fallon).Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that . He 's supposed to be a teacher you see , and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach . The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable , but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot . Not Fallon , who is neither funny , nor an actor , but appears to think he is both . Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role , or believe that there is any way these two people should , or would be together . Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore ( who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance ) tells Fallon that its over , too much has happened , and she 's moving on . And rather than feeling bad about the scene , or sorry for Fallon , you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago . But of course the plot mechanics wo n't allow that to be the end of it ( an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess ) , and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions . Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying , but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else .	0
"I wish I could give this movie a zero , or even lower , because sadly that 's what it deserves . I honestly never walk out of a movie , but this one was so dreadfully awful that I could n't stand another minute of it . Please , please , please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie . If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into , this is n't it.It has unattractive , unappealing leads , choppy structure , ridiculous dialog , and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way . On an absolutely basic level , it fails to entertain . Everything about "" Mango Kiss "" is so stagey , it is WORSE than any student film I have seen.As if that were n't enough , the entire movie relies on constant ( and I mean CONSTANT ) voice over narration . The script writer may as well have written a novel , because they insisted on TELLING everything , instead of SHOWING it . We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection , even though there is no character development to illustrate this . Also , this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes , and not in a natural way , but in a freeze - frame of the characters with their name written over the screen . There is no introduction , no development of any of the characters . We do n't really get to know any of them.This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen.I am a gay woman , who watched this film with my roommate ( another gay woman ) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema . I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it does n't matter how atrocious it is , people will still flock to it , and champion it , no matter how poor the quality is . Please do n't rent this ! ! Instead , let 's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting "" But I 'm a Cheerleader "" or "" Fire "" or "" Heavenly Creatures "" , instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community ( i.e. Queer as Folk ) ."	0
"A long - defunct prison , shut down for over 20 years , is re - opened and Ethan Sharpe ( the late , great character actor Lane Smith ) , once a guard there , is put in place as warden . As the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up , they 're instructed to break into the old execution room . This unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners ; cool - as - can - be low - key prisoner Burke ( Viggo Mortensen , showing real poise in an early role ) is thrust into the role of hero.I know it 's a no - brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere ( it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins , Wyoming ) , but it elevates this horror film to a higher level . It 's got a great sense of foreboding , established right at the outset . Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here ; it got him the "" Nightmare on Elm Street 4 "" directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies , thrillers , and horror films.It may have stock characters , but it 's got a capable cast bringing them to life : Chelsea Field as the young woman vying for prison reform , Lincoln Kilpatrick as weary veteran convict Cresus , Tom Everett as restless con Rabbitt , Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna , Tommy "" Tiny "" Lister as soft - spoken giant Tiny , and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton . It 's also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder ( as the vengeful spirit ) that helped * him * land the gig of playing Jason Voorhees in the "" Friday the 13th "" series.Decent special effects , moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer Mac Ahlberg , spooky music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone , great visuals , the incredibly gloomy location , and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining . It 's nasty , gruesome , and good fun for a horror fan.8/10"	1
"With this movie being the only Dirty Harry movie which Clint Eastwood not only stars , but produces and directs as well , you know it 's got to be good . Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series , I completely disagree . In my opinion , apart from the original Dirty Harry , Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series . Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences , it does n't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do . This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good , and it 's got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good . In Diry Harry it 's "" .. Well do ya , punk ? "" ; in Magnum Force "" A man 's got to know his limitations "" ; and in this it 's "" Go ahead . Make my day . "" Also in this film it 's nice to see a change of scenery , as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series . With great acting by Clint Eastwood and co - star Sandra Locke , and good directing by Clint , this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever ."	1
If you are a fan of Altman 's large ensemble casts , as evidenced in major films like M.A.S.H. , Nashville , Gosford Park , and lesser seen films like A Wedding , then you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH. Centered around a Health Convention where two women are running for President , HealtH contains many of Altman 's latter 70s regulars like Paul Dooley ( who helped write the film ) , Carol Burnett , and Henry Gibson , while also including top star Altman newcomers like Lauren Bacall , James Garner , and Glenda Jackson . Like a lot of Altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film , but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding , rather it has a more centered feel , perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park . The whole thing is an obvious satire on the Health movement , filled with over - top , outlandish , contradictive characters , with guest stars like Dick Cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing . Underlining the whole election process is Altman 's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having . This would be one of Altman 's last films like this for a while !	1
I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award , but after watching it , it 's easy to see why it did n't . Despite the beautiful photography , the film is incredibly slow moving , despite having hardly any plot.The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents ' death in what may or may not have been an accident ( the film is never clear on this ) , and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories . The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot , but they 're very short , and do n't really seem to have any point . < br />The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life , but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient , but that does n't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure . Perfect metaphor for this film really . < br />The photography of Skye is beautiful though , but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it 's infinitely better than this one .	0
Though Frank Loesser 's songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer , they 're bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation -- when it 's over it barely feels like you 've watched a musical . Mankiewicz does n't seem to know how to present Loesser 's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect : for example , one of the best numbers , the showstopping ` Adelaide 's Lament ' , concludes by having Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge ; and Stubby Kaye 's faux - spiritual ` Sit Down , You 're Rockin ' The Boat ' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there . Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue ( adapted from Abe Burrows ' stage book ) has none of the wit that his films like ` All About Eve ' have . Part of the blame has to go to the leads , just about all of whom are miscast : Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why he 's in a musical , Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential ( the songs are not tailored to his style ) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might . Only Blaine , as the lovelorn showgirl Adelaide , commands our attention like a Broadway pro should . The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets .	0
I am not a very good writer , so I 'll keep this short . World at War is the best WWII documentary that I 've seen . I 've seen different WWII documentaries ( not only English / North American ) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary that I 've seen . I think it could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler got to power , but it does a very good job at covering the war . It seems to be complete and objective / fair to everyone . It does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations . It has a lot of original footage , including color footage and many eye witnesses ( it was made in 70 's when a lot more were alive ) . It has great music and narrator . All - in - All I gave this one 10/10 , because it 's that good . ( I have n't seen specials in DVD version so I can not comment on those )	1
My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people . It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny , unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and could n't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such . I would n't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script . Stacy 's ( the carrier of the baby ) mother is a riot . She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window . Bobby 's ( the father ) best friend 's name is Dewey , and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn 's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High . This movie is horrid , simply because none of the characters are believable . Thank goodness it 's only made for TV , limiting the public 's chances of viewing it .	0

This film is a complete re - imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus . The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus . There is a border between them , and a constant state of war with the Israeli army ever present everywhere and the Palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs . The situation is bleak enough . We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap . But the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay , Noam from Tel Aviv and Ashraf from Nablus . To be gay is accepted in Tel Aviv . It is off limits in Nablus . The conflict between the two peoples , the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures , two ethics . But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension . Ashraf 's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in Nablus . Ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay . She can not accept it but accepts to speak about it later . From the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into Tel Aviv to set up a bomb attack . It takes place in a café in Tel Aviv and one friend of Noam 's is severely wounded . Bad enough . The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack , but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street . The funeral follows the wedding . The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack . Ashraf volunteers to take his place . The exiled lover comes back to Tel Aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister . He arrives at a diner managed by some friends of Noam 's . But Noam sees him and gets out to speak to him . Ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when Noam reaches him in the street . The vengeance reunites the two lovers in death . We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona , a neutral character that can impose peace , or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel . The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides . But the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film , a play that shows love in Auschwitz , between two prisoners , one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle . This is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking : gay love in Auschwitz . What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible . The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that can not but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on . We should never have let Great Britain deal with the region a long time ago . Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated . This will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution . But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations . So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden , of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on : so let 's procreate more and more little soldiers . But love is just an extra - terrestrial concept.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne	1
...... in a horror movie that is . Alright first off , lets start with Kate . Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney , looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over . Got ta love her . She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran . I mean she did n't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late . I mean the guy tried to rape her . I ca nt get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot . I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night . The movie kept going on . And as a result lost all its credibility .	0
"When the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster . But honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser . The movie has a Tag - line - "" Preeti Madhura , Tyaga Amara "" which means Love 's Sweet but Sacrifice is Immortal . In the movie the hero of the movie ( Ganesh ) sacrifices his love for the leading lady ( Pooja Gandhi ) even though the two loved each other ! His justification is the meaning of the tag - line . This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this "" Loser - like Sacrificial "" attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is , when they could have moved on with their lives . Ganesh 's acting in the movie is Amateurish , Crass and Childishly stupid . He actually looks funny in a song , ( Onde Ondu Sari ... ) when he 's supposed to look all stylish and cool . His looks do n't help the leading role either . His hair style is badly done in most part of the movie . POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT . Her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent . < br />The good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie . Also the lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are very well penned . The Director Yograj Bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner . < br />Anyway all - in - all except for the songs , the movie is a very ordinary one ! ! ! ! ! !"	0
After the reasonably successful MASTI which was tad better Inder Kumar returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL , HEAR NO EVIL < br />The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE(1994 ) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and deaf < br />This movie is a tedious exercise < br />The film has jokes of such nonsense that you do n't feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi 's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we do n't laugh at now but mock < br />The film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are funny sadly such moments do n't last long as the story never moves in this half even the comedy gets boring The twist is well handled and the second half becomes an action film where the blind guy and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all OTT chase scenes and fight scenes < br />Direction by Inder Kumar is bad Music is okay , one song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL < br />Vivek is awful in the comic scenes , his timing is very bad and is okay in serious scenes For some reason he keeps doing comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan is tad better but too wooden Amongst the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is okay	0
"Carnosaur 3 is bad ... awfully bad . Bad to the point where it is funny . How matter how much I try to convince myself , I just ca n't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons . I mean , come on , even the cover is bad ! OK , the special effects are absolutely ridiculous . Those "" Carnosaurs "" are really ridiculous . A scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast , yet when you see them run , they run at the speed of ... an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can . And the explosions are funny(there is no other word to describe it ) . At the beginning , a bullet hits a Jeep AFTER a guys says "" What was that ? "" ... And the other explosions are also laughable . But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so - called story . You do n't expect a good story(or , I do n't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie ) but at least the story has to try to make sense . I mean , how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent . Incredibly hard if you look at this . Oh , and if you think that it 's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters , tell it to the writers of this awful , awful piece of crap . I mean , what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead ? And they do lots of it . And if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action - packed , WAKE UP ! ! ! This movie is incredibly dull . The carnosaurs(who invented this lame name anyway ? ) attack(in boring action sequences where you do n't see much happening ) . The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but ca n't seem to convince even just one second ) . So , then , they attack the carnosaurs , but their idea does n't work(another laughable action sequence ) . Back to planning(with a few lame jokes thrown in ) in another ridiculous scene . And this goes on , and on , and on . And let 's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects ... and the story ... Oh OK , this movie simply sucks from A to Z.<br / >"	0
Horrendous pillaging of a classic.It was n't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates . He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him , but he still does n't help himself at all with his actions . ( inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel ; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues ; lying about the knives , etc ... ) This , in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him , but this somehow does n't happen just so they can play the ' mistaken - identity - murder - game later on . Which in itself is also ridiculous : ' So - and - so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him ! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative did n't need extending.It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again , but that 's about the only small pleasure to be had . It 's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock , and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you should n't be bothering at all .	0
One of the most heart - warming foreign films I 've ever seen.The young girl is an amazing talent . Stellar performances by her ( Doggie ) , the old man ( the king of masks ) , and Liang ( the Living Boddhisatva).(SPOILER ) The deplorable treatment of children , especially females is disturbing.Loved the music . The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.This is a MUST SEE -- enjoyable family film , although not for very young children . Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the DVD and the transfer had included the widescreen version .	1
Okay , first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE ! FIRST - This movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3D. It is for the most part , but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2D ! What ! ! ? ! ? ! It 's not that hard to film in a car ! ! ! SECOND - The story is n't very good . There are a lot of things wrong with it.THIRD - Why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film ! It made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed ! ! ! Watch it for a good laugh , but do n't waste your time buying it . Just download it or something for cheap .	1
This was the beginning of it all ! Granted , this is not Friends at its best , but this was the show 's pilot , let 's not forget and not a bad one at that . We 're introduced to the gang and Central Perk , where our story begins . Even from this first episode we get a sign of the Ross - Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years , when Ross says : ' I just want to be married again ' and Rachel storms in with a wedding dress on ... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a Monica - Joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back . Something else .. in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes , the so - called ' flashbacks ' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions . Nevertheless , the point is this a fine start to a great show . This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are accustomed to them , with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was ! Keep watching , first season is a blast ! !	1
I own almost every Seagal movie ( yes even ones like this that are low budget ) , and I must say , this may be the worst , not only of his movies , but of all movies ever made . The only highlight of this film , and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 , is that A. it is Seagal , and B. Seagal does have some sweet action sequences , specifically in the store , and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people , and do n't even bother with a story line , because the storyline not only stunk , but so did the acting , the fact that F-18 's and F-14 's somehow changed into F-16s , and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16 . Also the Stealth never had to refuel ? ? ? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point . last I checked , Afghanistan has no Air Force , we ( USA ) control the skies . Also , this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room , yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . Also , how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck , to the top ? PLease tell us why they jailed him , Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos ( unless they are Owen Wilson ? ) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries , considering Muslims do n't drink alcohol ? Also on top of that , since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the # 2 in charge ? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store , and the other 50 people he killed with a knife , as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .	0
"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject . There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight ( or gay ) man working in a gay sexual environment . The dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component . They may not all be prostitutes for hire , but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered . From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the "" dancers "" for private sessions . Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the "" dancers "" only playing to the women in the audience . This just is n't the reality of these clubs . It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples . So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients ? We learn very little . Instead we get filler . A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers . A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers ' lives and attitudes.The pictures of Mexico City are generic . The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous.This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing . The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men ."	0
For anyone with a moderate sensibility , a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition , for anyone capable of getting above the Hollywood ilk , for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of Seagals / Willis / Van Dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom , for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp , sympathise with , comprehend , laugh WITH , cry WITH natural tender heart - warming hilarious compassionate HUMAN BEINGS , ` Le Huitième Jour ' is waiting for you . Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece , that would have been too simplistic ; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling . Is it a drama ? Is it a comedy ? No : it is the story of Georges , a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality , a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome . It is a story which has you laughing through your tears , but this is not one of those classic tear - jerkers ; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration , warmth and even love . A successful banking salesman , Harry , bumps into Georges : they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas , problems and priorities ; skillfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship , but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road . This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other . The cuasi - surrealist scenes fit in perfectly : Georges recalls ( or invents ) past scenes of his life while either day - dreaming or sleeping ; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct . The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show - rooms . However , this does not detract from the whole . This film is a monument . Even if your French is not up to much , please bear seeing it with sub - titles . ` Le Huitième Jour ' is worth the trouble . As for anything else , well , just read the following commentaries  I go along with all of them . This film is a joy , it is majestic , it is unique . If you have seen ` Rain Man ' which I consider an excellent film , you must see this one : it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous Hollywood - produced world - renowned actors ; it has Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil  TEN oscars for these two , and three more for Jaco van Dormael . Who cares  ? Yes : 11 out of 10 if the IMDb rating does n't break down under the strain.Magnifique ! Chapeau !	1
"Billed as Takashi Miike 's "" first family film "" - by people who have n't seen Zebraman , presumably . YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family - friendliness , diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale . A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware . The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else Miike has done , with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures ( the YOKAI ) . Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors , but I think it 's probably just that he wanted to do something different . He 's really never been a one - trick pony , but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics . Regardless , it 's a great project for Miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.There 's a very cartoonish feel to the production , evoking thoughts of Miyazaki in places . The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales , which certainly influenced Miyazaki as well ( particularly SPIRITED AWAY ) . It must remembered that Miike has nothing like the budget of a Harry Potter film to work with , so the special effects are n't going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue - screening is especially obvious . Some of the special effects are great though , with some very well animated creatures ( a mix of CG , stop - motion and puppetry ) . I think the little sock - puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was * meant * to look really cheap , and is all the cuter for it :) The young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it 's so hard to find a pre - teen who actually understands the concept of acting , but 9 year old Ryunosuke Kamiki is a genuine talent ( I see he did voices in the last 2 Miyazaki films ! ) . Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece , though Mai Takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie - eared River Princess - yum yum ! Those looking for another violent , perverted gangster film are n't going to find what they 're looking for in YOKAI , but if you 're a fan of Miike because of his imagination and wit , there 's plenty to satisfy here . And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you 've got :)"	1
"The movie is about Anton Newcombe . The music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop . It 's only fair that Newcombe have the last word about the film , which at this writing you can find in the "" news "" section at the brianjonestownmassacre website . I 'd link it here but IMDb wo n't permit it.Documentarians are limited by what the camera captures , as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat - random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight - line with relevant happenstance . In Dig ! , fortune smiled on the Dandy Warhols , capturing their rise to the status of pop - idol candidates , as they formed slickly - produced pop confections for mass consumption , most notably "" Bohemian Like You , "" a song that made them global darlings thanks to a Euro cell phone ad . < br />No such luck for Brian Jonestown Massacre . The film captures little of what made the original BJM lineup great , with the sole exception of a single montage , lasting a minute or so , showing Newcombe creating / recording a number of brief instrumental parts , unremarkable in themselves , and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush , shimmering sounds that had to have been in Newcombe 's mind and soul before they could enter the world.Three commentaries accompany the film ; one by the filmmakers , and two by the members of the bands ( the BJM track is solely former members , and without Newcombe ) . Both the Warhols and BJM alumni point up this montage sequence as the "" best "" bit in the film , and I 'd agree that , given the film 's focus on Anton Newcombe , it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift , and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the "" tortured artist . ""Interesting thing about commentaries is that , unlike film , they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing.The Dandies do not come off well in their comments . If the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as I believe it does -- the Dandies are the popularity - obsessed preppy types , the ones who listen to rock because it 's what their peers do , while the BJM crew come off as the half - rejected , half - self - exiled outsiders ( to insiders like the Dandies , "" losers "" ) that are the real rock spirit . BJM 's Joel Gion , who talks a LOT , nails the film 's message for me when he says ( paraphrasing ) : "" You ca n't forget that Anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do . Make a lot of great music . ""The Dandies , meanwhile , laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of Newcombe 's meltdown ( all the BJM footage here ends at 1997 , before Newcombe quit heroin ) . Courtney Taylor - Taylor 's discounting of Newcombe 's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows : "" He 's 37 and still living in his car . You can download all his work at his website . He was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else , he 's giving it all away . He could be making a mint . "" You can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief.The film 's shortcomings ca n't be blamed on the filmmakers ; rather it 's the difficulties of the documentary form , and the loss of cooperation by the film 's subject , that makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary . But it 's likely the best we will get , outside of his music.I only rented disc one , which has the feature . Most of the extras are on disc two . Not renting that , as I 've put in my order to buy the set ."	1
Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow , Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film . It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981 . Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles ; as Holmes 's wife and underage girlfriend , respectively . The rest of the cast has such small roles that it 's impossible to get any dimensions from them . The film also stars Carrie Fisher , Ted Levine , Franky G , MC Gainey , Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton .	0
Oh man , it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science , well , I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics ! Al Gore tries to make this issue sound complicated , even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda!How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet ? By estimating the sun spot activity . Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate ? No , not even Gore himself ! So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past ? According to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be . How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen ( relatively ) equal much as on earth ? Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise?Use some common sense ! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a HOAX . Please research it yourself . What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild ( banking family that arranged live earth event ) to gain from this ? Well , the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits , that is tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions , and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money , centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers . Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits ! Is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world , especially if it goes into his own company ? < br />I do not want you to blindly believe me , please do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion !	0
"This movie starts out promisingly , with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against Gary Cooper 's marriage to his daughter , Anita Louise . Frank Morgan , playing an unabashed gold - digger , loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter , Anita Louise . I am a fan of all 3 actors . Frank Morgan is ( to my mind ) a Hollywood treasure , Cooper a legend , and Louise a very lovely , versatile and under - appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role . I also have nothing against Teresa Wright , and while not blessed with great range , she usually delivers heart - warming performances.From a promising opening , the story slides downhill all the way to the end . I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper 's would - be in - laws . The butler in such a fastidious , non - smoking household would never just blithely walk away , allowing Cooper to continue smoking , or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill - timed cigarette . Moreover , nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it . And finally , nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket ! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche . It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter . < br />The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived . Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent ! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it 's absurd ! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense , and that , too , is nothing to laugh about . Finally , the scenes of Cooper 's overly fastidious , neurotic attention to his baby 's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies . But to me they just seem tedious and slow . The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes , while paradoxically , the script writer went to sleep.The lines are just not in the script to generate humor . They just miss on all cylinders . The laughs come not a mile - a - minute , but more like a light year - a - minute . The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera.The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper 's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together . There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine , but none of it was extracted.In the end , one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt . Predictably , it is the Anita Louise character , who gets jilted on her would - be - wedding night ! While it is not on camera , that is her fate , and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end . She had n't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic ( unlike Gail Patrick , say , in My Favorite Wife ) . Consequently , I was expecting ( perhaps "" hoping "" is a better word in the context of the film ! ) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending , too . The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie 's end really undermines the effect of the "" happy ending "" for Cooper and Wright.I kept waiting for something to happen , for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era ... And it never delivered . A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here ."	0
"First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do n't read the books , play the games , wear the underwear or eat the cereal ( if there is one ) . I am simply a fan of the films.With that being said , I struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise . Taking this movie by itself , and not comparing it to it 's terrible predecessors ( EP 1 , 2 ) , I do n't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie . For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue , contrived scenes ( ie R2 suddenly being a badass , and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch ) , HORRIBLE acting , and noted plot holes ... how is this good ? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin ; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden . I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so ( which by the way was ruined by the "" NOOOOOO ! "" Frankenstein scene ) . When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one - liners when more could have and should have been said , this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE . For a film with such a "" dark "" tone , there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.I close with a question : From the beginning to the end of the film , was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place ?"	0
"The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals on the Summer migration to winter grazing . The basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a "" forgotten people "" and how they lived during what we in the West knew as the "" roaring twenties . "" A more drastic contrast could not be imagined . Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die . To make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place , a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end . The version that I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film . Having said all this , the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening 's entertainment . The crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple re - takes . The Western inter - titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day . Off - duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "" policeman 's ball . "" The producers went on to make the docu - drama Chang ( 1927 ) and the totally commercial King Kong ( 1933 ) . The migration theme is used again in People of the Wind ( 1976 ) and in Himalaya ( 1999 ) . Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into -- and then highly recommended for them ."	1
This was an adorable movie . A real feel - good movie when you need one . The story is light ( this is no Gone With the Wind ) but sometimes , one needs this kind of plot . Funny and warm characters , fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe.Parminder K. Nagra ( also from the TV show ER ) is WONDERFUL in this role . She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood . All should keep an eye on her , she 's going to be BIG in the future.Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie . A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes . I was dancing throughout most of the movie.Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need .	1
"A must for any punk rocker , this is the movie that made The Ramones a household name back in the early 1980 's ( when it first appeared on premium cable stations ) . This was one of the first and best of the American Punk Rock movies , with a cult classic status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Originally the producers wanted Cheap Trick as the stars , but the release of the "" Live At Budakon "" album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie . Very good luck for the Ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market ( which sadly never happened until after the bands demise ) . The band , Dee Dee especially , always disliked the movie through the 80 's but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into Ramones shows . This movie , like most classics , is stupid fun with some classic Ramones footage in their heyday . Do n't expect more , you wo n't find it . It 's great fun , so enjoy it . Another Allan Arkush classic movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy , featuring Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear ."	1
"I have never seen a worse movie.It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.Mistake 1 : absolutely no connection to any of the characters . In this movie you do n't bond with any of the characters because ... you do n't get a chance.The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand : Salish as played by Clint Howard . Except for this unique character , the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.Mistake 2 : the worst gunfight scene ever . I love gunfights . I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house . heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes . But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is "" Apathetic "" I 've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME . In this movie it looked and felt like the "" Actors "" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.Why ? Where 's the trash talking ? where 's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire ? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad ... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters , I recomend Sam Rami 's Evil Dead series . DO NOT see the disaster that is house of the dead . I hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie ."	0
"A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth . ( Things must be pretty bad back on Mars . ) Two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash . Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy 's Pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.The diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning . Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge . The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus , although he did n't notice who they were . The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed . One of them is an alien , but which one ? All of them are suspect . There 's the crazy old man ( Jack Elam ) , of course , who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit . There 's a blustering businessman who must get to Boston ( John Hoyt ) . A young couple on their honeymoon . ( Execrable performance by the husband , Ron Kipling . ) Except for the couples , nobody has noticed anyone else . And even the couples are suspicious of each other . Bride to newly minted husband : "" I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin . "" The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason , the lights go on and off , the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.It 's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle . There is no discernible "" depth "" to it . It 's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens . It 's not a warning of any kind , just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.I always enjoy it when it 's on . It 's especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman , knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM 's version of Shakespeare 's play . And here he is -- with three arms.Oops ."	1
"This is one of those movies that 's trying to be moody and tense , and instead , ends up tripping all over itself . Having seen it at a queer film festival , I was intrigued by the "" young college threesome gone wrong "" write - up , however , over - all ended up quite disappointed.It 's hard to critique a "" true story "" since there 's not much that can be done about the plot - but I found this disjointed , melodramatic and wholly depressing . It 's dark and almost sinister , painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close - ups . It just does n't work - some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe , my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes.The story has an interesting premise , but this just spins downward into a dark , miserable spiral ."	0
"This really is one of the worst movies ever made . I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting , lame "" special effects "" a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies , AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or whatever to offer . This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate , maybe worse . Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job ( no zombie film though).This flick is not even funny , not speaking of anything else . Really bad and redundant special effects , zombies that look like normal people ( except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces ) , WAY TO MUCH fake blood ( I like realism a lot , the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable , but the presented gore is just plain silly ) . The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes , it gets boring and you can not help but wonder , why the zombies use WEAPONS ( ! ) to kill their prey . I will not go into the details of the dubbing ( others have done so ) . Although I am from Germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version , I will NOT waste more of my time with this movie.Keep away from it , as far as you can ."	0
"Brutal , emotionless Michael Myers stabs his sister to death at age six on Halloween night in 1963 ; on October 30 , 1978 , he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield , Illinois . He is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist ( Donald Pleasence ) who knows just how evil this young man is.It opens with a bang , and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire . It 's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were ; subtle , and scary . It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings . How many movies are there , really , that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before ? Not very many.Pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career ; Jamie Lee Curtis , in her motion picture debut , became a bona fide scream queen after acting in "" Halloween "" as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures , and she is an intended victim worth rooting for.Co - writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie , making excellent use of shadows and dark skies ; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall . With this picture , he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels , many imitators , and an upcoming "" re - imagining"".It 's very quotable - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis ' ( Pleasence ) speech in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff ( Charles Cyphers , a reliable repertory player in several of Carpenter 's earlier works)?It 's fantastic , and worth seeking out . This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time.It 's not totally infallible - there are script holes , after all - but overall it makes a solid impact.9/10"	1
"To be honest , I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it . That 's how I watch movies whenever possible . No preconception . I thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something . I was wrong , kinda.Loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me . I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do.Another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but I beg to differ . These kinds of things DO happen . I 'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "" implausible "" . Really sorry but the reality of the WORLD is that they DO happen . The creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices . Sometimes things turn out good , sometimes they turn out bad and such is life.I highly recommend this movie ."	1
I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho - hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period . Frank James was never mentioned , Cole Younger , ditto , and Bloody Bill Anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script . Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about . how sad . The costumes were wonderful however , as was the location shooting in Missouri . I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again , or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .	0
"Ye Lou 's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization ( Purple Butterfly ) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai . Ding Hui ( Zhang Ziyi ) and her ex - lover Hidehiko Itami ( Toru Nakamura ) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.I agree with the reviewer from Paris . The film substitutes a convoluted , semi - historical conflict for a plot , without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes . The sudden time shifting does n't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless . Normally I do n't mind dark movies , but the absence of light , the bone - jarringly shaky camera footage , and the generally bad film - making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in . I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film "" has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography "" , but I do n't think that helps the movie . The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century , and I do n't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film . The overly melodramatic moments do n't add to its watchability.The actors are all suitably melancholy . Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films , brooding and looking generally annoyed . However , at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love - making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.All in all , a very disappointing film , especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He . 2/10"	0
The acting in the film is really well done honestly , but the movie is so slow and so boring , as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt . I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this , he did a great job , so did the other actors as I mentioned but man ... this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen . Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good , but other than that , avoid it . This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous . < br />I never , ever , walk out on films , but watching this one at home with family , I walked out . Yeah , it was that boring . Apparently my comment does n't have enough lines to post , so here 's some more filler . I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched .	0
Sam Kleinman ( Peter Falk ) comes to his son 's place unexpectedly . His son Ben Kleinman ( Paul Reiser ) is quite surprised to hear that his mother , Muriel Kleinman ( Olympia Dukakis ) has left his father . Ben 's wife , Rachel ( Elizabeth Perkins ) and his three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father go see a farmhouse that 's for sale . But that 's not the end of their journey . Their road trip turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father . Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks ( 2005).Paul Reiser is behind the screenplay and he has done a remarkable job . The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing . And he did work with the script for twenty years so no wonder it 's this good . Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk ? Nobody , I can tell you that . And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part . Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh . And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie . It 's just hilarious when they go fishing . And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick . The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times . But it can also be touching from time to time . You could n't tell a story any better than it is told here .	1
"This is not a very good movie , but it 's not a stinker either . It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.My GF and I have figured this movie out ( we think ) so here it is:***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***Firstly , this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious - dream - state junk ( 95 % of the movie.)Ignoring the junk , what REALLY happened is this : A group of school friends go to a rave one night . They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die . That 's the simple cut down version . ( That 's right , I said Sean , bear with me)Right after the accident , Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie . This is where the dream part starts.The movie is called SOUL Survivors , right ? Cassie 's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls ( Annie , Matt , Raven , the 2 weirdos and Jude ) along with images conjured up by her mind ( Sean , school and everything else around her ) . The souls continue doing what they were defined as : Annie the rave - going chick , the 2 weirdo - killers ( from opening scene ) , Father Jude still helping people etc.We are then taken on a very long ride , shown lots of images ( many of which my GF and I still ca n't tie in ) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie 's time to die.At the end , Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "" dead "" for a while . Her family and Sean are there . This is reality again . She 's OK.Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled . But this part is really just a nightmare , and she wakes up beside Sean , obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience.Due to space restrictions , we did n't cover every little thing , but feel free to drop us an e - mail if you want to.<br / >"	0
"As I reach the "" backside "" of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed , drug influenced teens of today . It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today . This film drives that point home to the core . If you are a late 70 's fan you 'll love the film . From KISS - posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! < br />Watch for a young Laura Dern . Why they did n't have more songs from the Runaways I 'll never know ? < br />I did have a problem with Randy Quaid 's character deflowering a 16 year old girl . While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude 's house . The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff.Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge , Fast Times , Dazed & Confused , and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks.I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all ."	1
"Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I begin?!?This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made . This one is fun to laugh at , where as Manos was just painful to watch . Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term : "" 80 's cheeze "" . The acting ( and I am using this term loosely ) is atrocious , the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see , and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed . The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3 K , and that version is the only way to watch this mess . This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one - liners they have ever done . If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots ..... God help you ! !"	0
"I must admit that I had my doubts about this movie before I was going to watch it . The main reason for that is because it was compared to a Hitchcock movie . I 've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by Hitchcock or that could have been made by the ' Master of Suspense ' himself , but so far I have n't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time . In my opinion Hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some ( cheap ) thrillers , but on the other hand I must admit that I was intrigued by it because this is a European movie . Normally it 's the big Hollywood studios who like to abuse Hitchcock 's name if that can raise their income . But this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic European countries ever and I 'm sure that most French would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an Englishman . That 's why I decided to give this movie a try and I must say that I 'm glad that I did.""Sur mes lèvres "" or "" Read my Lips "" as it is called in English , tells the story of a young secretary named Carla . She is a hardworking and loyal employee , but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues . That has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency , which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company . But when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her , all this is about to change . Paul Angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex - convict . The man is a thief , but Carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed . She hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like , but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life ... Since I still believe that the name Hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - I will not make any comparisons between Hitchcock and Jacques Audiard 's directing . Fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie . I had n't heard of him before , but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end . That also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course . I doubt if there is someone in Hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role , instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband ( you know , the typical TV - movie story).Also worth noticing is the acting in this movie . Vincent Cassel is quite famous , but Emmanuelle Devos was a complete mystery to me . There is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles , but they both did an excellent job with their characters , making them feel very believable and realistic . Paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and Carla the typically helpless woman , but thanks to their performances , you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.All in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting . Despite the fact that I had my doubts about it , I 've soon become one of its greatest admirers . I give this movie an 8/10 . Do n't hesitate to give it a try ."	1
OK , let 's get this clear . I 'm really not into sci - fi , but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1 . < br />Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate . A round device that creates a wormhole . It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . It might sound like your usual sci - fi - series , but it 's not ! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci - fi - series . I find that great . It gives you things , happenings and such you can relate to , and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology , there 's not many . < br />The series has a nice blending of action , humor and drama . If you enjoy loads of special effects you 're not going to find it here . They do n't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .	1
"I know that originally , this film was NOT a box office hit , but in light of recent Hollywood releases ( most of which have been decidedly formula - ridden , plot less , pointless , "" save - the - blonde - chick - no - matter - what "" drivel ) , Feast of All Saints , certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion . The film -- like the book -- loses anchoring in some of the historical background , but it depicts a uniquely American dilemma set against the uniquely horrific American institution of human enslavement , and some of its tragic ( and funny , and touching ) consequences.And worthy of singling out is the youthful Robert Ri'chard , cast as the leading figure , Marcel , whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his ' coming of age , ' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the Southern plantation world of Louisiana , at the apex of the antebellum period . When I saw the previews featuring the ( dreaded ) blond - haired Ri'chard , I expected a buffoon , a fop , a caricature -- I was pleasantly surprised.Ossie Davis , Ruby Dee , the late Ben Vereen , Pam Grier , Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage , voodoo , Creole "" aristocracy , "" and Haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion , hate , love , family , and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us ."	1
"Recently , I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City ( Olathe , KS . ) of this title . It is difficult for me , being a lover of the art as I am , to report the following , but , the truth sometimes hurts , and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe ( I 'm using the slang definition here - worthless statements or writing ) for an hour and a half , I feel obligated to share ( WARN ) any interested parties . Let 's begin at the beginning , a good place to start as always . The first 15 minutes are not really that bad , a couple of laughs , and decent development , but then it is downhill from there . This is the story of a woman , in her mid thirties , that ( as the writer would like for you to believe ) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled . The first major difficulty occurs when if you do n't know that fact going into the movie , you wo n't know it when she suddenly risks it all for , in my opinion , a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman . There is little development ( drastically insufficient development ) to justify her actions for the affair she has , and when it occurs , one feels , as I did , that she is just of low moral character . The word "" slut "" comes to mind , hopefully , they 'll let that pass the review and post the comment . This , in my opinion , is the first fatal flaw of the film . If you 're married or have ever been in love , irregardless of whether you are male or female , its going to turn you off . Quite frankly , I feel that it would have made a much better "" blue movie "" - that 's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving . The second fatal flaw is the casting , Diane Lane just did n't work for me here , and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job , believe me . The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin , the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places , conveying a subtle yet very blunt ( I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate ) portrayal of an emerging teen . Bravo , well done . I 'm not going to give the ending away , but I was disappointed , being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing ... but an ending like that .... Well , if that teased you enough to see this picture , do n't say I did n't warn you , but you better look fast - if this celluloid is released , I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames . I 'd say wait for the video , but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value . Hmmm , Dustin Hoffman produced this , you think he 'd learn after Ishtar . This film once carried the working title "" Blouse Man "" and should have been left on the rack . If you 've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film , give this one 35 - 40 minutes , the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin , if you can stomach the fact that you 'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home , which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you 're off to the movies to see this one . That 's my two cents , for what it is worth ."	0
For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry 's highly respected novel , this film will definitely impress you , because of how honorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot , Sturla Gunnarson 's feature film debut is an almost dead - on recreation of the book ( down to the last line).For those of you who have not read the novel , this movie might be a little tricky . It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story . Instead it has a strong element of realism to it , but I would not have it any other way . The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale , Hindu version of ' Fiddler On The Roof ' . Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman , the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 's Bombay during the time of the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan . He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life , including his sick daughter , his individualist eldest son , a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money , and an unhealthy neighborhood . The Ending is not a happy one , nor is it a sad one , but that is essentially what realism involves . < br />Such a Long Journey is a fine little movie , but if you want to see it , then good luck finding it . Unlike the novel , it has received very little release .	1
I found this film to be the usual French slap in America 's face . The camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . While the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . There were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in Glencoe and neat , organized homes , but Malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . < br />I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst elements . I can assure you , as a frequent visitor to France , that all is not well there . Foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . But Americans are not eager to unmask the French for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the U.S. , so we 're not likely to see films on the subject .	1
""" Return of the Jedi "" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right , and that is a shame , because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling . It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale , and does so very convincingly.Yes , there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit . But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga , where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader , the most recognizable villain in movie history.Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook : it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline ( which went from slightly implausible in the "" Empire Strikes Back "" to very convincing here ) , an exciting opening at Jabba 's Palace , a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor , Luke finally coming into his own , the resolution of Solo and Leia 's romance , and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.Yes , there are slight annoyances . But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who 've had time to nitpick every single scene . It 's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter . It 's not a ' good ' movie - it 's fantastic !"	1
"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films . That is their great attraction . They take from life and serve it up raw . American films , rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society . Too many hang - ups and a morbid fear of financial failure . The Almighty dollar , determines their selections . Something which invites European directors . In addition , audiences world wide remain hungry for "" different "" films , especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched , suffering body of humanity .

This is one of the best comedy ever ! The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast , well just look at the names of the cast and you 'll understand why it is so great .

I watched this movie every chance I got , back in the Seventies when it came out on cable . It was my introduction to Harlem , which has fascinated me ( and Bill Clinton ) ever since . I was still very young , and the movie made a big impression on me . It was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up , trying to decide whom they wanted to be , and making some bad choices as well as good ones . I was dazzled by Lonette McKee 's beauty , the great dresses they eventually got to wear , and the snappy dialogue . As someone being raised by a single mother as well , I could really identify with these girls and their lives . It 's funny , these characters seem almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles !	1

"God ! Zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as Tarzan , and probably had about as many actors in the title role . < br />This Serial is one of my own personal favourites , and as previously stated , it is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials . Oddly enough , this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 . * By the time of this production in ' 39 , Zorro was really well known as a ( Pulp ) literary and movie character . The film opens up with a little foot note about the History of the Mexico 's struggle for freedom from rule by a European Monarchy , namely Spain . The story invites comparison with the American Revolutionary War.The story concentrates its attention to the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its ' Council ' . It is being addressed by Benito Juarez**on their gold mine 's relation to the new Republic of Mexico . Gold shipments must get thru to Mexico City.Don Francisco Uncle to Diego Vega , states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys . A thug from the Don del Oro mob , stages an ' insult ' to himself and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords , Don Frasncisco getting run through.Suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark ' Z ' on the face of the bad guy , he dispatches him to the hereafter . Don Francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward Ramon ( William Corson ) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles . He also attempts to tell of the true identity of Don del Oro , but expires before completing statement.There is a big reception for Diego at Don Francisco 's Hacienda , where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister ( also ward of Don Francisco ) with his timid act . "" A FOP ! ! "" , she declares.Later , Diego and Ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers . When they ask , "" who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead ? "" , Ramon declares "" Zorro , we are Zorro 's Fighting Legion ! "" Well there is a big battle with the Legion , now all clad on gray , with masks and capes , protecting the Gold Train . Then Zorro seems trapped at a man - made avalanche intended for the convoy , when , well , you know cliffhanger end of Chapter One.Wow ! That was a lot of writing for one Chapter , but like most other Serials , the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line . Let 's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good , well made , action filled Chapters following.ZORRO 's FIGHTING LEGION has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action . We have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups . There is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of ' Don del Oro ' . We had soldiers , renegade Whites , hostile Indians and the Legion.In short , it 's safe to say that there is everything one could want , and then some , in this Serial . And , incidentally , they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any Mexican accents.As to just what is there here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest ? What makes it different or unique ? Well ........ First of all , it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen . The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the Cantina in Chapter One . This is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track.And yet there is one more feature that really sets the Fighting Legion saga out in front from all others . That is , the film not only has a heroic musical theme , but it also sports Lyrics , yes , the Legionairres sing ! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several Chapters ! It really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing.When the Serial was first shown on our local television ( circa 1955 ) , all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as belonging to ' Captain Braddock from RACKET SQUAD , the TV Series . Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive , deep voice . * * * He also handled the role very well . His costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional.There is a small slip up . A sort of minor anachronism occurs by having Benito Juarez(Carleton Young)addressing the San Mendelito Council , as Juarez was about 18 years old at this time ( 1824 ) and , though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in Mexico 's History , he surely had n't achieved such prominence yet . His inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of Warner Brothers ' JUAREZ that year , which starred Paul Muni in the title role.This is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial , but also my favourite Zorro film.<br / > * We are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year , what with GONE WITH THE WIND , MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , THE CITADEL , JUAREZ , THE WIZARD OF OZ , OF MICE AND MEN , ONE MILLION B.C.,ZENOBIA , WE WANT OUR MUMMY all counted among the output that year.<br / > * * Once again , Juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 , about 25 years later . Also , the political sub - divisions are referred to as ' Provinces ' in the story . In actuality , they are called ' States ' .

* What I Like About SPOILERS * Teenager Holly Tyler ( Amanda Bynes ) goes to live with older sister Valerie ( Jennie Garth ) to avoid moving to Japan with her father ; but she does n't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on , and not only to her , but to her sister , her friends Gary ( Wesley Jonathan ) and Tina ( Alison Munn ) , boyfriend Henry ( Michael McMillian ) , crush Vince ( Nick Zano ) , Valerie 's boyfriend Jeff ( Simon Rex ) , first boss ( then firefighter then husband ) Vic ( Dan Cortese ) , annoying colleague Lauren ( Leslie Grossman ) and second boss Peter ( ? ) If you do n't have a funny bone in your body , please skip this ; if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this is n't for you ; if you like a funny , sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead ( and none other than the fabulous ' Mary Cherry ' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast ) , then what the hell are you waiting for ?

"This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does n't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes . What she does do however , is shine when she 's on screen . The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day . JANCIE RULE shows promise and it 's a shame she did n't become a big star . RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the "" go - getter "" with aplomb . Better if this was in color . The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well . What 's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes . If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you 'll like this one ."	0
Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river . They are pacifist Ed ( Jon Voight ) , adventurous , violent Lewis ( Burt Reynolds ) , obnoxious Bobby ( Ned Beatty ) and nice guy Drew ( Ronny Cox ) . The first 40 minute are great -- there 's the incredible dueling banjos sequence , interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond . Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby . One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes a nightmare.Just unbelievable . The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place . To be truthful , Beatty 's rape has never bothered me -- I'm very aware it 's being faked despite the good acting . This movie also shows how the characters change -- Ed has his pacifism tested , Lewis becomes weak , Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane . Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.The acting is mostly good . Voight is just OK in the lead -- he 's been better . Beatty is also just OK -- but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role . Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart . And Reynolds is just superb -- one of his best acting jobs EVER ! How this was n't even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me . Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.A powerful film -- NOT for children . Try to see an uncut version -- the TV version is butchered . Also letter - boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images .	1
"Except people apparently buy into this garbage ! As shows like "" Moral Orel "" have shown , even if you tried to make the most outrageous , over - the - top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of , it would n't come close to the hilarity of this show . It 's hard to tell what 's even going on when you 're watching it . Is it a news show ? A talk show ? Who knows ! ? They start out by reporting on various international news stories , but at seemingly random points , the news is interrupted by this odd , troll - like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face , mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.Pat Robertson does n't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance . He just seems like a senile , yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs ( like most of our grandparents ) . But this is a man who has called for an assassination , who has befriended and offered aid to not one , but TWO murderous dictators , who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines , who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China , and who regularly implies that Caucasians ( straight American male Caucasians in particular ) are superior to all other races.Still , this would all be funny , except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later ( either that , or enough money to bribe some TV executives who do n't give a damn what they show ) . The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people , somewhere , must be watching it and hanging onto every word . Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is , people still listen to him . I do n't know if it 's funny or scary . I guess a healthy mixture of both ."	0
Another British cinema flag waver . Real garbage on offer here once again . I can not understand ( and I am British ) why this over the top , patriotic nonsense was ever made . EIGHT years mark you , from when the second world war had actually ended ! Other commenter 's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage . This is extremely poorly observed . The archive footage is in abundance . Model aircraft swing from wires in the ' action scenes ' like so many children 's kites in the wind . The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event . Guinness must have his worst acting performance ever . The shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable . Hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area . Ealing made many great movies . This clearly is not one of them . They should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot !	0
"Airwolf The Movie , A variation on the original 2 part pilot , Yet the movie although shorter , does contain extra footage Unseen in the 2 hour pilot The pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot movie is normally the same ( 2 parter combined ) But the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.Worth a look , even if you have the season 1 DVD set , I 'd still pick up a copy of the "" movie "" It 's still in some shops like virgin , Woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores , although it generally needs ordering , But it saves needing to buy online ( as many of us still do n't do or trust online shopping ) but if you look around airwolfs in stores < br />Airwolf was truly 1 of the 80 's most under rated shows.A full size Airwolf is currently being re - built for a Helicopter Museum :) Info and work in progress pictures are over at http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It seams she 's finally here to stay :)"	1
"Before I start , I should point out that I know the editor of this film . We 've never met , but we belong to the same fanzine(those things which came before message boards ) , and we have talked on the phone , so I do have a bias here . Anyway ... Somehow , it 's ironic how while the "" Rat Pack "" culture of the late 50 's and early to mid-60 's made a comeback in the mid-90 's , this movie , from the son of one of the original Rat Pack , and which was made in a similar fashion , was a flop . Not only that , it was a critical flop ; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not savage this(he gave it a mixed review , as I recall ) . And while I do n't think this is the greatest film in the world , and I am not a fan of the Rat Pack , or "" cocktail , "" culture , I do think this is worth seeing.For one thing , this looks stylish , and moves right along . For another , the core performances are all good . Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium , and has a droll edge to him . Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre - blockbuster days , like THE BIG CHILL . And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie , she does it entertainingly . Admittedly , it 's not a great film ; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns , and a lot of them do n't work(like the whole "" Zen of Ben "" speech ) . And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here . Still , I was entertained , and if you like gangster films , you might be too ."	1
"I have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like Friday the 13th / I Know What You Did Last Summer , this movie was n't that bad . In fact it was n't as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently . The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that , original . The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low - budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan / Lions Gate has been offering . My only real complaint that was n't due to the film 's budget , which must have been small , was the contrived "" twist "" ending . I 'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me . The ending was just stupid and tacked on . Before that I was a little bored , but actually enjoying it . 4/10"	0
"In this day and age of incredible special movie effects , this one was a sore disappointment . The actors seemed stiff and uninspired , as was the dialogue . Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days , but movies like "" Silverado "" prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . Considering that , it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing , much less creating such a weak film as this one . If you love and are looking for a good western , keep looking !"	0
I rented domino on a whim , not even knowing it was inspired by a true story , and even though it 's the least likely and true biopic you 'll probably see . i found it to be rather awesome.With Richard Kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment . And once you 've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it . < br />Domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career . It has an edgy acid trip style provided by director Tony Scott . And with fast paced music and editing , it provides the visual flare to keep your attention , with slick performances and unexpected comedy , the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience . < br />I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours .	1
"I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast , so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio ( a skateboard chase scene ! ) . Jodie Foster in her first "" grown - up "" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess . Two hours out of my life that I 'll never get back ! No noteworthy characters , unbelievable storyline , questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all , I could n't have cared less . The story of California teens in the 1970 's , where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots . Do n't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie ."	0
"THE CAT O'NINE TAILS ( Il Gatto a Nove Code ) < br />Aspect ratio : 2.35:1 ( Cromoscope)Sound format : Mono < br />(35 mm and 70 mm release prints)A blind ex - journalist ( Karl Malden ) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter ( James Franciscus ) to investigate a series of murders at the lab , unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE ( 1969 ) , Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo - thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner , toplining celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON ( 1969 ) - and rising star Franciscus ( THE VALLEY OF GWANGI ) . Sadly , the resulting film - which the ads claimed was ' nine times more suspenseful ' than "" Bird "" - is a disappointing follow - up , impeccably photographed and stylishly executed , but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles , and cinematographer Enrico Menczer ( THE DEAD ARE ALIVE ) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi - tech world in which Argento 's dark - hearted scenario unfolds , but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak ( THE LIBERTINE ) as Franciscus ' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding . Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black - gloved assassin in a crowded railway station ( edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli ) , and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer 's devious machinations . But despite these flashes of brilliance , the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next , simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil . It 's no surprise that "" Cat "" failed to emulate the runaway success of "" Bird "" when released in 1971.(English version )"	0
This is a good family show with a great cast of actors . It 's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late . There is nothing else quite like it on television right now either , unless you count Joan of Arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too . Anyway , Clubhouse is worth a look because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character ( Pete Young ) a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly . Dean Cain , Christopher Lloyd , Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round out the rest of the main cast members , and each is terrific in their role . I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete 's sister Betsy ; she is quite a pill , but she still cares about her mom and brother , even though she hates to show it . It may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs , but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while , so check it out people -- you'll be glad you did !	1
"Well to answer one persons 's question of "" why does n't anyone remember this film ? "" it 's because really , not that many people saw it in 1978 and it 's not been shown much on TV since . ( If it 's on video that 'd be news to me ! ) Even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the ' 70s , movie - goers had the smarts to avoid this film . Unless they love Billy Crytal , Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "" that "" much ! < br />Paul Lynde was funnier on "" Bewitched "" or "" Hollywood Squares "" than here . Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter 's lack of weight ! Har - har Joan ! It also seems like every "" somewhat "" famous name from the era is in the cast . ( Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of "" Everybody Loves Raymond"".)Anyhow , a somewhat good idea for a storyline , a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here . With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was "" on top "" instead of him , he gets pregnant ! ( A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men).Crystal 's stomach grows , he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings . Unfortunately , he is now a socially misunderstood outcast ! He 's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out ( I guess).He 's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby ... in a barn . Or if you will , a manger ( God only knows where it may have exited from ! Ewwww ! ) It turns out ( no shock here ) to be a girl ! < br />Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable , the humor is high school level or less.2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ Billy Crystal . Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test , it flunks big time!I ca n't believe Roddy McDowell signed on either ! ( END )"	0
"UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young , the journalist on whose real - life experiences this movie is based . The key word here is "" based "" . How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom.Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York , where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It . This involves him selling out , and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity . However , they are not overdone : the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney 's misadventures . The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid , well - meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart , moderately obnoxious skilled writer . This contradiction is never that much of an issue , because Simon Pegg ( as Sidney ) projects likability too well.Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney 's editor a little too effectively , and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidney 's affections And , with regard to Megan Fox ( who plays an airhead bimbo starlet ) , I can say only this : just say the word , Miss Fox , and I will leave my wife , sell all my belongings , and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort . Of course , given that I 'm a fat 56-year - old English accountant , you might not find my offer too enticing , but it 's there on the table anyway . Given how short her career has been so far , one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become : however , she does it sweetly , with some skill , and extremely sexily . This girl will go far.There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK , Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US.There are several laugh - out - loud moments , and I smiled most of the way through . As ever , the F - word makes appearances when it really does n't need to , although at least a couple of these are very funny ."	1
Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80 's . It 's a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch . In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate on . The screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters . Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date . He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line , in each move . Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career . Jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical Hollywood 's typical character elements . After the war none is a hero . Everybody is a loser , and this movie is about that simple truth . None can mend up his pieces after a war , just like the heroes of this movie . Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates . Simply magnificent movie .	1

There has been a political documentary , of recent vintage , called Why We Fight , which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation . It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq . Yet , a far more famous series of films , with the same name , was made during World War Two , by Hollywood director Frank Capra . Although considered documentaries , and having won Oscars in that category , this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop , more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal 's Triumph Of The Will , scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes . That said , that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries ( such as the BBC 's lauded The World At War ) lacked , nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable . They are skillfully made , and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store , I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase . I chose Goodtimes DVD 's four DVD collection of the series.Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable . While there are no extras on the DVDs , and the sound quality of the prints varies , these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago , when racism was overt ( as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro - war cartoons of the era ) , and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts . The seven films , produced between 1942 and 1945 , are Prelude To War , The Nazis Strike , Divide And Conquer , The Battle Of Britain , The Battle Of Russia , The Battle Of China , and War Comes To America.Overall , the film series is well worth watching , not only for the obvious reasons , but for the subtle things it reveals , such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars , rather than the modern singular , or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria . Yet , it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars . The lesson of World War One ( avoid foreign entanglements ) was not applicable to World War Two , whose own lesson ( act early against dictatorships ) has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since : Korea , Vietnam , nor Iraq . The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today 's information - clogged times . It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today , but at least you 'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position , nor will you be the last .	1
"Some funny bits , but come Bill ! A film ? Quoting Zeitgeist ? Keep the TV Show and the interviews , but a film ? I 'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film ... I do n't know . I laughed , disagreed , agreed ... this film is very confusing and inconsistent.Bill 's a funny guy ... but also very cocky ... Bill 's rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks , a brilliant comedian . But like many comedians , the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying . I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility . This might be just a personal taste , but comedy that constantly demeans somebody can not be taken as truth . Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism . I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible , but the response to it can not be sensible . It will create unnecessary turmoil . We can do better than just react to fundamentalism . His conclusion is that "" we do n't know "" and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything , to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion . His humility that he only knows that he does n't , is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non - sense.I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist , the movie in Bill 's film . All the astrotheology - influenced non - sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing . Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship . It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources . Astro - mystic sources that reduce everything to "" the stars say it all "" seem to be from the Middle Ages . This film is a confusing statement from a confused "" agnostic "" . Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as "" we do n't know"".This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.Watch the film ( it has hilarious interviews and bits ) but PLEASE do not behave like Bill . You can not expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line . His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting , provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation .. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues ."	0
Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ' movies , it was n't until about 6 years ago that I first saw ' Follow the Fleet ' . I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record ( yes , vinyl ) but knew nothing of the plot.Unfortunately , while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers ' character is sweet and funny , you just ca n't like ' Bake Baker ' . While trying to make up to his longtime partner , he continually sabotages her career . His character does n't have the usual humour and elan of the other films ' Astaire characters.Worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers .	0
Could anyone please stop John Carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation ? How low can you go ? It seems this man has lost any self respect.This episode looks like it has been done by a film student , it is n't even worth beginning to talk about WHAT was bad , because it was just a borefest , directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation ... Come on , Mr. Carpenter , please retire immediately with a rest of self - esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from Escape from L.A. to Ghosts of Mars.Get drunk instead .	0

"Seldom do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmgoers . Perhaps it 's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth , or are we missing something ? I 'd watch it again if I had some incentive.So what 's a happenstance ? To the French it is "" Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon "" Serendipity ? Fate ? Perhaps it 's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings . We 've all had these ( it 's called life ) but when looked at in this way , you begin to get the feeling that "" random "" might be more like "" fated . ""A ' happenstance ' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble . All these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture ? Dominoes . Multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen . And I think that there 's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this . But then this is the magic world of cinema.We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer / director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these French citizens . If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape , here 's the place to do it . Or if you 're recovering from surgery and are n't going anywhere anyway , this will engage you while your stitches are healing . < br />""Happenstance "" will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following . Stranger things have happened.<br / > Soren Kierkegaard is attributed with the following : "" Life can only be understood backwards ; but it must be lived forward . "" If you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences ( meeting your first love , finding the perfect gift , your last auto accident ) you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it.That 's the answer ! I forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain "" Happenstance "" to me ."	1
"It is said that David Lynch 's films and shorts wo n't appeal to everyone . Neither will Dumbland , maybe more than ever . I have a feeling that Dumbland , as people come across it , will be a true mark of ' I get it ' or ' what the hell ' . It 's not surrealism exactly , but absurd to the point of no return . It 's also very , very , very stupid . But in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it , that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is , and this self - consciousness is a plus , not a detraction . < br />It 's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts- the kind that might not even make it on Hertzfeldt and Judge 's Animation show ( which , I might add , Lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work- centered on a lummox with an IQ of 20 who has a constantly quivering - with - fear wife , and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and/or an alien . The episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill , a salesman who can recite the Gettysburg address , watching over a sick brother in law , ant hallucinations , and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around . All the while , Lynch is still experimenting , as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off Inland Empire.For one thing , he 's going back to the roots of his very first short , Six Figures Getting Sick Six Times , in the usage of repetition as a means to an end . This sometimes works excruciatingly well , and sometimes not . Sometimes , like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around , the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect . And even an episode like with the guy 's friend coming over is funny more - so for the Beavis & Butt - head comparison ( both laugh like idiots , and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep ) . What ends up working is how Lynch shows up front delirious abstractions , in the crudest ways imaginable , and excessive violence . < br />In what comes closest to surrealism in "" ants "" , the guy mistakenly sprays bug - spray ( just called "" Kill "" , one of Lynch 's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions ) on himself , and envisions ants in a musical chorus line , solos included . And one of the most harrowingly funny things I 've ever seen from the filmmaker is "" get the stick "" , where we just see the guy , cheered on by his son , getting a stick lodged in his mouth . Soon the neck breaks , eyes pop out , and once said stick is removed he does n't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover . Other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices , and it 's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul - mouthed language ( mostly from the man , as well as from the ' grandmother ' , who in one of Lynch 's voices for the characters is the deepest of all ) , and a shaky quality that 's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from ( early ) Hertzfeldt.All the same I 'm still not sure if Dumbland is something I would put into someone 's hands if they have n't seen much of Lynch yet let alone anything by him . There are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in Lynch 's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life . However in general there 's not a whole lot that should be read into it , which is why I 'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion . Those who dig the bottom - less pits of animated comedy , be prepared have a blast ."	1
Watched this film having really enjoyed Gregory 's Girl many years ago . This was drivel . The plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14 - 15-year - old girls in very short skirts . Previous commenters seem to think that this does n't matter , but I found it rather nasty . If you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils . We were surprised that the censor let that through . Apart from that the film was just a waste of time . The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image , slightly wacky and off the wall . Why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible . This film failed on all counts for me . Dreadful . Please do n't waste your time watching it . Life 's too short	0
I became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other I have ever watched . That may be because I can see the characters as my own grandparents , attempting to make sense of a world at war . The ending and use of Pachabel 's Cannon are both amazing .	1
"I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film .... the road side bar scene in Russia . In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "" 50 Dollars .. you Drink and Talk "" , but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could , so I declined to take this speaking part on . I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience .... and who knows ... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "" I 'll be Back "" and "" Quite Frankly My Dear , I Do n't Give a Damn "" . Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as ' Heavy 1 ' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski . < br />As time goes on , I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.Even though I spent a whole day on the set , in South Wales hot - spot Barry Island , no one could tell me what the actual storyline was . The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it ..... things could certainly have been worse if I 'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films .... Still ..... On the positive side .... I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break . I had no idea who he was , as "" Notting Hill "" was yet to be released , and not an inkling that he might be Welsh . Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s . It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production ........"	0
""" The Lady in Question ( 1999 ) "" starring Gene Wilder is a well - acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black - and - white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series . Both Perry and "" Cash "" kept me guessing right up to the end . There were many suspects with a motive for the murder , but I had no idea which character it would be.Gene Wilder has a special charming wit about him , even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part . The portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well . I 'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off . I am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie . Even his singing was a delight . I like him in this role more than his former "" sillier "" roles like "" The Young Frankenstein "" and "" Willy Wonka . "" I am hoping A & E will continue this series . They ought to call it something like "" The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries . ""The music fit the period . I enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes . I was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period . And I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script . To me , that always distracts.Overall , my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well - crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites : Raymond Burr 's Perry Mason ."	1
"Good movies are original , some leave a message or touch you in a certain way , but sometimes you 're not in the mood for that . < br />I wanted something simple , no thinking just plain action when I watched this one . It started of good and was quite entertaining , so why a bad review . Well in the end the movie lost it 's credibility . The storyline was n't that cheesy at all , the action was not too special but overall good , acting was OK , so more than enough to satisfy my needs . But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top , and it left me with a bad feeling . They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the "" no thinking just plain action "" category . So in conclusion if you know you 'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical : do n't watch ! otherwise I 'd say go ahead ..."	0
"Many critics have felt offended that R.W. Fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist Wilkie and the Nazis in this movie in a human - like manner . Connoisseurs of other Fassbinder films , however , will realize that "" Lili Marleen "" ( 1981 ) belongs to Fassbinder 's "" women movies "" like "" The Marriage of Maria Braun "" ( 1979 ) and "" Lola "" ( 1981 ) . Fassbinder was convinced that "" stories can be told much better with women than with men "" , because , according to Fassbinder , while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society , "" women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner "" . Dialectics , however , means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black - and - white world , but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide . Moreover , dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished . Concretely speaking : Starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state , the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do , and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation , so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender . Fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme , that transcends classical logic , in his play "" The City , the Garbage and the Death "" ( 1975 ) which was filmed by Daniel Schmid under the title "" Shadow of Angels "" ( 1976).Therefore , approaching an a priori controversial topic like Nazi Germany , in a dialectic manner , the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial , especially for people who can not or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light - switch schema , but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis . The mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized , since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones . In a synthetic viewpoint , the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness . They are mutually related . In a world - view based on classical logic , a relation between good and bad can not even been established , and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic , the bad conscience of the survivors of Nazi Germany , feeling ( illogically enough ) responsible for the deeds of their ancestors , exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well . From Fassbinder 's dialectic viewpoint , it follows that neither Lili Marleen nor Lola nor Maria Braun can be condemned for their "" misuse "" of the ruling system for their private purposes , because they do n't misuse them , they just use them . In the opposite , since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims , because "" good "" and "" bad "" are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two - valued logic , their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world , that is not black and white at all , much better than a black - and - white logic ."	1
< br />Not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak English ( with an Australian accent ) they ALSO call their stars by the SAME names our Earthly astronomers have given them!And topping all that off , all alien life knows just how mean , evil , wasteful and destructive us humans are . And they 're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is.If you ever have the chance to see this movie , do n't . Well , unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia.This movie tries to get a moral , ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon .	0
"* * * * * WARNING , MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE . * * * * < br />Heres some good advise to anyone living in the U.K. Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80 's comedy on late at night , read a book instead . I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure , due to reading some of the comments on this film on here . I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic ! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commie 's our borders ... I found this film dire in the utmost pretence , maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny , who knows ? But in all aspects , this film is not just awful , its teeth grindingly terrible.I've never been a fan of Bill Murray , and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him . Do n't get me wrong , I loved Ghostbuster 's , which was made only three years after this film . But this just sums Bill Murray up really . I can safely say that I have n't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here , though these two films have more in common than you would think . For 1 thing , they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end , and 2nd . They are both riddled with cheesy Cliché 's , throughout.Heres one thing , these guys are supposed to be in the "" U.S Army "" . Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp , Willy nilly , seducing female Military Police Officers , and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters . Talk about Random ! This film is just terrible for this I 'm afraid . Now do n't get me wrong , I 'm no feminist sympathiser , but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them , letting them go free ... Twice , is just insulting to the female race . The fact that one tatty haired , fat lipped bum ( Winger ) and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MP 's underwear , to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous.Then there is the training scenes , where you get to meet the Squad "" Phycho "" who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff , followed by the overweight bloke ( played by the late and great John Candy ) who claims he joined the army to "" avoid paying $ 400 for anger management classes "" . Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the "" Giant Toe , "" ( WTF ? ) ' Drill Seargent ' who honestly could n't organise a pi$$ up in a brewery , let alone his band of recruits . All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes , with people saying "" way to go ass hole ' ! "" all the time , etc etc.The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course , leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle , peppering a watch tower with bullets . ( Just like that . Yep , told you this film was random ... He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well ... ) Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade , where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours . ( Bugger me , Miracle ! ) Thanks to some wise words from Murray , to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric ' General ' in front of the rest of the squads . All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand , who really should 've been arresting them ... Everyone laughs it off though . This bit is nothing short of amazing though . He then chooses them to guard a new Multi - Million Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy ( which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside ) , claiming "" This is exactly what this Army needs ! "" righto ... Then there is the dire finale , where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top - secret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany . To which the Hapless Captain ( John Larroquette ) then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle . To which they then take a "" wrong turn "" en - route and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia , where they are captured . ( Like we did n't see that coming ... ) Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray + Birds in hand , to which is where a big fight , loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up . With them coming back as National Heroes , humiliating the Russians by calling them "" pussies , "" etc etc . The end . That s right . No Courts Martial , nothing . They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle , drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could 've sparked WW3!This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness . I know its meant to be a Comedy , it got all the right actors for it , but where in the hell is it ? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out ? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers , and female Mud Wrestling . ( like I said , Random ) Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film , of course . This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old 's , sadly , we have to watch it instead . 1 star out of 10 - Total Tripe . My advice , do something a little more useful with your time . Like Castrating yourself ..."	0
"Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform . However , I was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story . David Duchovny,(Dr . Eugene Sands),""Connie & Carla"",'04 , was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine . Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie,(Claire),""Taking Lives"",'04 , who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands . Timothy Hutton,(Raymond Blossom),""Kinsey"",'04 , plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections . Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed . Gary Dourdan,(Yates),""CSI - Vegas TV Series "" , plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so - called body guard for Raymond Blossom . Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men . This film is not the greatest , but it does entertain ."	0
"It 's a strange , yet somehow impressive story , about love . Personnaly , I never run over such a twist - off story in real life . But , I can image there is.It 's a story that promises to be "" sick "" from the title . But , after I watch it , I did n't get this feeling of "" sickness "" which I would surely have regarding society rules . It 's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... which I can not contradict using any moral or society rules.The movie focuses mostly on relation between Kiki and Alex . You can see how this relation starts , evolves and finally ends . You feel the moment when this love blossoms , the first whispers , touchings . You feel the connection . And no moment I though this is immoral . You even hope it will not break in the end .... it can not break ... it 's not right . You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end ... But , I need also to add a negative spin to this comment ... I do n't know if the story is not somehow * showed * to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form , but not in content . You do n't have the total story , but only fragments . When movie has started , the relation between Kiki and Sandu was already in place . So , no clue about the nature of the relation . You feel only a tension between them ... a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation . I think this line of Kiki to Sandu says all : "" I want to stop ... and if you love me , you will do as I ask you"".This movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral ... and where 's the limit between them . I do n't know if the idea of this movie is "" love conquers all ... even social and moral standards "" or "" love is beautiful ... no matter how or where "" . But in my opinion , this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ..."	1
Born Again the Limerick : < br />If a man could come back from the dead < br />And live in a little girl 's head < br />Revenge he would get < br />For the murder he met < br />By the guy that 's now in his wife 's bed.For me Born Again is a highly under - rated , classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X - Files for me before I started watching it . I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil , but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl . I tell you I could n't sleep for weeks ! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy . Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge . Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night . You 'd think her parents would have been worried . And maybe they were we just do n't really see that part of the story . And was was with the telekinesis ? Other than adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already creepy story , there really was n't any kind of good explanation for it . But even with its little flaws , in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it . 10 out of 10 .	1
"In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape . The Thakur goes south . Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style . The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north . The severing of the hands of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in Aag . So make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered Kurta covers up for the cut fingers . Moreso in the climax where the Thakur uses his legs and says""Tere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai "" here Narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain . Babban , the new avtar of gabbar is also different . He is not from Bihar or UP . He is Bambaiya . Gabbar 's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued . Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba . he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba . Babban is more intelligent this time . He tosses the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover laws of gravitation . Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo . Nisha Kothari can not play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like ' entertain ' and ' too much ' with gay abandon . Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role . The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful . The water tank turns into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide . Jai was composed and serious . Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him . But he also bungles on the Mausi sequence . He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ . Jaya 's role played by Sushmita changes careers . A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed . She too lacks the pain that Jaya displayed . Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time . Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe . He does not have to point guns and answer questions of Gabbar this time . He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den . Horses give way to Jeeps and auto . The Gabbar 's hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj . All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else . RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic . But we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues . So we call it a spoof . So Mr . RGV(Sholay ) and Farhan Akhtar ( Don ) and JPDutta(Umrao jaan ) stop making remixes and start making originals ."	0
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see . i was talked into it and dragged into the theater , but boy am i glad for that . i thought it was going to be just another love story , but it turns out to be SOOO much more than that . definatly an intellectual flick , one of those movies you have to pay attention to .	1
But the rest of us , who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying .. enjoy ! < br />Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick , a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother , Eugene , played by Ray Liotta , who is a doctor and who works very long hours . < br />Due to Eugene 's work schedule , Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls . He really just wants to be a good boy , to do the right thing , and to make his brother proud of him . He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started . < br />Not about to give anything away here , but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking . Those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story , its loving characters and a great song I can not quote here , that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate .. but you hear it in a bar.I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie , since he was for ' Amadeus ' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning . No such luck . Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact , but then he does later on . All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does n't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget .	1
"How you could say that Peaches , with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues , is "" a small TV idea "" is beyond me . Besides I can think of many films that have "" a small TV idea "" in their plots . Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ( "" Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background "" ) is confusing . particularly as you are having such "" a great time "" working in TV . If only we could all be so talented as Ms Smith ( no , I am not a friend or relative ) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ , Road from Coorain , etc . All made for TV . Come to think of it , what about those other "" small TV ideas "" like "" Against the Wind "" , "" Bodyline "" , "" The Dismissal "" , "" Scales of Justice "" , "" Blue Murder "" , "" Water under the Bridge "" , etc . I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested , and most of my friends as well , from start to finish . It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years . Who knows , with a few more viewings ( there 's so much to think about ) , it might just be up there with classics like "" The Year My Voice Broke "" , "" The Devil 's Playground "" . I really did enjoy this film much more than "" Somersault "" and "" Three Dollars "" . These films , I think , had their moments - surreal , atmospheric , realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues , but as for sheer entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer and me , it was very ordinary if not boring . When I go to a movie , I am always conscious of the audience 's reaction to a film ( through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo ) . Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads , some with negative criticisms , but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience ."	1
""" Ardh Satya "" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema . Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani , this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success . Even today , Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.The film tells the Real - life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s . Unlike any Police of other cities in India , Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether . Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.Amongst various Police officers & colleagues , the film describes the story of Anand Velankar , a young hot - blooded Cop coming from a poor family . His father is a harsh Police Constable . Anand himself suffers from his father 's ideologies & incidences of his father 's Atrocities on his mother . Anand 's approach towards immediate action against crime , is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction . The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand 's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . This leads to frustrations , as he can not achieve the desired Job - satisfaction . Resulting from the frustrations , his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars , also turning him to an alcoholic.The Spirit within him is still alive , as he constantly fights the system . He is aware of the system of the Metro , where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end . His compromise towards unethical practice is negative . Finally he gets suspended.The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core . One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty 's house to arrest him , followed by short conversation which is fantastic . At many scenes , the film has Hair - raising moments.The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch . Alcoholism , Corruption , Political Influence , Courage , Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today . Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.Finally , the films belongs to the One man show , Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly ."	1
It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties . It is about passion and feelings , about Russian soul , and very romantic . This movie IS NOT action packed , it flowes slowely . In second part one can find great songs - Russian romances . It is much more better than Doctor Zhivago . The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example .	1
Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan . However , this film is not for me . Many far - fetched arguments are trying to support this film 's claim that dragons possibly ever existed . The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries , but fails to investigate them more thoroughly , which could have given the film some credibility . The film uses ( nice ! ) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon 's life . This is combined with popular - TV - show - CSI - style flash - forwards to make it look like something scientific , which it is definitely not . In many cases the arguments / clues are far - fetched . In some cases , clues used to show dragons possibly existed , or flew , or spit fire are simply invalid . To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes . Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it , but this one just does n't have it . Bottom line : it 's a pretentious fantasy - CSI documentary , not worth watching .	0
"First off , this is an excellent series , though we have sort of a James Bond effect . What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006 , it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 , Dr. No ( 1962 ) being the second , while in Golden Eye , the first film with Pierce Brosnan , Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male "" M "" so how could she have been in place in the beginning before Bond became a double-0 , aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older ? This is more or less a "" poetic "" license to thrill . We need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained . No , the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago . In the 1960 's communicators were fantasy . ( now we call them cell phones ) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons . OMG , do you think 400 years from now , they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean - Luc Picard ? So , please , let 's give the producers some leeway.But to try and make things a bit consistent , let us just ponder about the Cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of Battlestar Galactica . If that is the case , where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from ? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space . Well , what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with the Caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship , loaded with human - looking Cylons , wound up not only jumping through space , but through time , back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One . They colonized it , found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves , but not before they themselves sent out a "" ragtag "" fleet to search for the legendary Caprica , only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet , which they colonized to become the humans , who eventually invented the Cylons . Time paradox ? Of course . Which came first , the chicken or the road ? Who cares ? It 's fraking entertaining !"	1
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on . bad acting-- bad plot-- bad casting-- bad directing-- bad cinematography-- if they had set out to make a bad picture they could n't have done a better job . i hope they are proud of his turkey . i 'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood . do n't waste your time !	0
""" Chinese Ghost Story "" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I have ever seen . It 's a brilliant mix of fantasy , comedy , romance , horror and martial arts . The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights . I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue . Truly original and refreshing film and another Embalmer 's fine recommendation ."	1
Reportedy based on actual historical events , this disturbingly violent , bloody , and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era . Ms. Bolkan 's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force . Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences : her witnessing of the hated local Duke 's casual rapist activity , her forbidden love affair with a Jew , her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed ( Anthony Corlan ) There are some painfully realistic gory sequences ( human flaying ) in this film that are not for the squeamish , but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest . Deserves to be seen , if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world .	1
"This programme bugs me ! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called "" fun "" ! It 's just far too educational for my liking ! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing . The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again . Where 's the fun in it ? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much . Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes ? I think it 's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like : Inspector Gadget , Bananaman , The Smurfs , Snorks , Moomins , the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows ! I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse , so what 's going on with that ? ! 3/10"	0
Cross - eyed is a very original and funny movie . I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way . This film is smart , concise , and consistently entertaining and funny . As a writer / director , Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable . The story is definitely something you have n't seen before which is good . It 's unique and fun , and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy.A very promising first film .	1
The scenes are fast - paced . the characters are great . I love Anne - Marie Johnson 's acting . I really like the ending . < br />However , I was disappointed that this movie did n't delve deeper into Achilles 's and Athena 's relationship . It only blossomed when they kissed each other .	1
Since September of last year , I have been borrowing four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library , which boasts an impressive DVD collection . ( The HWL truly is a circulating library : three - quarters of its films are out at any given time ! ) Recently , I was thrilled to find The Short Films of David Lynch . Yesterday , knowing little about the animated series , I picked up Dumbland . I 'm here to report that , for David Lynch fans , watching the eight episodes is half an hour well - spent.The most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their soundtracks . Each episode has its own rhythm . Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion . Outrageous voices accent pauses ' ends . Physical violence supplies the beats . Chirping birds and buzzing sockets brush along the edges . Many other elements fill out the orchestra . The pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound , but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch 's primary interest in creating and disseminating this work . In a way , these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms.That said , the situations are odd , ugly , profound , dumb and funny as hell . And there 's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be . I ca n't say that I 'll watch the collection again , but for anyone who revelled in the movements that is the suite Inland Empire , Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time .	1
"I 've always knew Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor , now I know she is a great writer / director also . I have been a fan since I first saw her in the movies "" Perfect "" , "" My Favorite Year "" , "" DC Cab "" and "" Stardust Memories"".It 's so rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything . She has been missing from the screen for far too long . It 's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit - com . This is her best work since "" the Last Picture Show "" . If you grew up in an Italian American family you will love this movie . I was n't expecting a lot when I started watching this movie , so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie . If you get the chance , watch it ."	1
This film has to be the worst I have ever seen . The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope . The story line of the film is laughable at best , with the acting so poor you just have to cringe . The title ' Zombie Nation ' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total . This can not be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80 's music when the zombies ' attack ' . The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a La Roux video . If you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so , then burn the copy .	0
"A have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an SOB who has a long term girlfriend . Of course the SOB is very good - looking , charming , etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman . Watching Jean Pierre Leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends . It 's tragic , and you know she 's going to end up very hurt , but there 's nothing you can do . Leaud is brilliant . Totally empty . A blank throughout , he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants.The scene two hours in when Leaud and Lebrun have made love , and the next morning he puts on a record and , very sweetly and charmingly , sings along to amuse her is brilliant . The "" What the hell am I doing here with this idiot "" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.It 's a long film , but see it in one go , preferably in a cinema . Takes a while to get into , but then the time just disappears ."	1
I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie . I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between class . But , for once a TV movie caught my interest . More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye . I really was n't a big fan of hers prior to this film . Sure I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets . But , something about this movie really did it for me . I would now see myself as a huge fan . This movie comes with high marks from ... me . Give it a chance , it wo n't let you down .	1
"I can hardly believe that this inert , turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works I 've quite enjoyed . The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE ( and no other word but "" enduring "" will do ) , left me in a vile mood , a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112 . For not only has Rohmer attempted ( with success ) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but , as ali has pointed out , has shown ( at the cost of alienating his audience ) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times . The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult , but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor ."	0
"Some of the acknowledged Altman "" masterpieces "" seem sadder to me now . Maybe it 's me . Like the last reviewer , I even like this "" lesser "" Altman ( shown recently on FMC ) , although I do n't think he was aiming at a wide audience . Organization politics as a "" microcosm "" for public campaigns . Some of this satirical "" docudrama "" is now dated , like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show , but I found much of the dialog funny and insightful ( e.g. "" You are for real . That means you 're no threat to anyone "" ) . The story is n't "" profound , "" but I liked it . And the performances are funny , especially Cavett ( as "" himself "" ) , Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figurehead , Glenda Jackson ( who actually became a member of Parliament ) as a left wing ideologue ( in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics ) , and Carol Burnett as a basket case . All in the inimitable Altman style , although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual . But pretty inimitable ."	1
I saw this movie in the theater , and was thoroughly impressed by it . Then again , that was when Claire Danes was a good actress , not the foolish , arrogant , Hollywood - ized bitch she is today . Anyway , this film really struck me as one of the more raw , realistic , beautiful friendship films . How far would you really go for your best friend ? I was moved to tears at the end , and still tear up when I watch it now ( I own it ) . I remember as soon as I left the theater , I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her . This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend . However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you 'd do something like that for her ....	1
We should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there . Only five others joined before the movie began.There is nothing at all to redeem this movie . The acting is awful ( especially Ms Hurley ) . The script is banal . The effects we 've seen a million times . The film direction the worst that we 've seen . Meandering and disjointed . No - one laughed including the kids.We left after 25 minutes . It would have been sooner if my wife had n't gone for a hot - dog!!!Do not waste your money on this film . If there 's nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks , popcorn and hot - dogs and do some people watching . You 'll have a much more enjoyable time!!!<br / >	0
"Best show since Seinfeld . She 's really really funny . Her total self centeredness , the hulking gay stoner neighbors , the departures into song or cartoons , make this the freshest show on TV . One of the few shows I make point of watching . The scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ( "" oh wait now that you 're close you do look old "" turns face with finger and walks away lol ) , the cough syrup overdose , sleeping with God , it 's all so funny or so stupid it 's just a lot of fun . The shows weak points are her sister and the cop - only because they 're too darn normal ! ! I really ca n't wait until the next show , something I have n't felt for any show in a long time ."	1
"Having not read the novel , I ca n't tell how faithful this film is . The story is typical mystery material : killer targets newlyweds ; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease . Yes , it sounds like a soap opera and that 's exactly how it plays . The first 2/3 are dull , save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.Acting is strictly sub par , though it 's hard to blame the actors alone : the screenplay is atrocious . During the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting , but that 's only the last 1/3 . Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element , but there 's only so much he can do with a TV budget and the network censors on his back . He 's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses , though he managed to squeeze in a couple "" under the floor "" shots during the murders in the club restroom . Unfortunately , as this is made for TV , the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found . Note to producers : give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.Summing it up : this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards(watch CSI , instead ) . If you 're in the mood for a film like this , I 've some excellent suggestions : pick up a copy of Dario Argento 's "" Deep Red""(my highest recommendation ; superb film ) , "" Opera "" , or even "" Tenebre "" . They 're stronger in every category ."	0
"The freedom of having your own Sea Going Power Boat , the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged , an 's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed ! ) assistants in fine Bikinis were all definite selling points for "" SEA HUNT""(1958 - 61).Just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going "" gun for hire "" * series . Let 's look closely now . There must be a some clues around.If we were to look back just a little , we see the RKO Radio Pictures production of UNDERWATER ! ( 1955 ) . It starred Jane Russell , Gilbert Roland , Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive Scuba Diving Adventurers working on salvage in the Carribbean , including a Pre - Fidel Cuba . The film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits . Fine , shapely Women Folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits ( Woo , woo , woo , woo ! ) are always a plus for the Guys ; and the presence of rugged , athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake "" poses "" is equally pleasing to the Gals.And there is one element that is a true legacy of this old RKO Feature . It is on the Soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes . It is the Recording of "" It 's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White "" , written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and His Orchestra.Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song ( with Lyrics)will not soon forget it . Its Carribbean Beat is so very lively and its rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is Powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory . The 45 RPM Record of this Song made it to the Top 10 most Popular Songs of the Week for many Saturday Evenings on NBC TV 's "" YOUR HIT PARADE "" . We ca n't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got . ( Maybe some one can fill us in on that one item , please ! ) So , we got back to "" SEA HUNT "" and its own odyssey in getting on "" the Tube "" . The public had taken to UNDERWATER ! all right , but would they go for a TV Series.ZIV TV Productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that , for the most part , did n't get signed on by the Networks for the multi - station hook - up treatment . But they had been having some great successes with Television Syndication . * * By that we mean , offering a Series for Stations for showings on a one to a TV Station per each Market Area . ( Much like the various Newspaper Syndicates "" sell "" Comic Strips to various Papers around the Country , and World , even.So , we got ' Mike Nelson ' , himself , in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges . Mr. Bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of Boston Blackie movies ( with Chester Morris)to THEY STOOGE TO CONGA ( 3 Stooges 1943 ) , SAHARA ( also 1943 ) , HOME OF THE BRAVE ( 1949 ) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS(1951).Lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization , along with a fine , convincingly athletic physique , having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities . He took very well as the Diver 's Diver , whether it 's performing duties on board ship , or fathoms beneath the Sea.And Lloyd did take to the role quickly , but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there , he was not familiar with S.C.U.B.A. * * * prior to landing this Mike Nelson gig . But the Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a quick learner , as so many of the close - up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it , that it was Lloyd with the mask , the bubbler(air tank ) and the flipper fins.Stories almost always involved the helping - out some client for pay , much like a Private Detective would . So what if the client was a lovely Lady who looked good in the Bathing Suit , all the better.Like so many of the other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions,""SEA HUNT "" possessed a fine , haunting Opening Theme and Closing , along with some original incidental music and queues.At one time , I believe that "" SEA HUNT "" was the top syndicated TV Series , a success that ZIV Series had known before with the likes of "" SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE""and "" HIGHWAY PATROL "" . As far as the showing venue for this underwater saga , here in Chicago it was shown late night ( after 10:30 P.M. ) on WNBQ TV , Channel 5 ( our NBC Affiliate , now known as WMAQ TV).And I can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was . And there were even on scene commercials done by the Star ! How well we can remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson , riding on his Power Boat . And as we were being invited to return the next week and watch "" ..... another adventure of "" SEA HUNT "" , sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse , Wisconsin ' the makers of Old Style Lager Beer ! "" , all while Mike was toasting us , raising an Old Style Bottle . ( Shame on you , Mike ! Drinking Beer on your moving Boat ! We 're tellin ' the Coast Guard ! ) Then , the Boat would leave the dock , accompanied by the Sea Hunt Theme and rolling the Credits.NOTE : * More figuratively than literal , Mike was for hire and things ran very much like a Deterctive Story.NOTE : * * ZIV 's Syndicated successes included "" SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE "" , "" WEST POINT""(and its clone "" MEN OF ANNAPOLIS "" ) , "" SEA HUNT "" and "" HIGHWAY PATROL"".NOTE * * * And of course , SCUBA is a acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus ."	1
"How come I 've never seen or even heard about this junk - movie before ? It 's right up my alley with bloody teenkill , laughable plotting and an irresistible 80 's cheese - atmosphere hanging around it . For some reason nobody is really interested in , the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath . Freshly recruited teacher Julie Parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behave strangely . This movie is hilariously bad ! There 's absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally meaningless to the others . For example , there 's a girl killed and her body dumped in a container . Then , and for no reason , the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed . Not even by her boyfriend ! The acting is pitiful and there is n't even a bit of nudity to enjoy . The revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... It 's not , guys ! "" Splatter University "" is easily one of the worst horror - turkeys ever ."	0
I regret that I 've seen this movie . Ca n't believe that the creator of Best Intentions and Pelle the Conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film . What a waste !	0
I just ca n't understand the negative comments about this film . Yes it is a typical boy - meets - girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by . Henstridge ( talk about winning the gene - pool lottery ! ) is as magnetic and alluring as ever ( who says the golden age of cinema is dead ? ) and Vartan holds his own.There is simmering chemistry between the two leads ; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots ! It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together ... Ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue , watch this flick , you will feel so much better . If you are already happy , then you will be euphoric.(PS : I am 33 , Male , from the UK and a hopeless romantic still searching for his Princess ... )	1
Man 's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called ' Hoovervilles ' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration . The proposition of this film is that a man 's home is still his castle even when it 's just a shack in a Hooverville.Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much . But in a part very typical for Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco , the start of a slew of classic roles , he 's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young.One of the things about Man 's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men . Women had some additional strains put on them , if men had trouble finding work , women had it twice as hard . And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal . Spence takes Loretta Young in who 's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle . Pretty soon though they 're in love , though Tracy is not the kind to settle down.The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man 's Castle . And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage . Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp , Marjorie Rambeau who 's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl , a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well . Hohl brings the plot of Man 's Castle to its climax through his scheming . < br />Man 's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression , not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment .	1
I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone else 's bad reviews . I thought : Even though I do n't read the books , that does n't look anything like the Nancy Drew I 've heard of . But I was wrong . Sure , it was n't a carbon copy of the books , but when you make a movie out of something , you have to modify it to become big - screen entertainment . The plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character . There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements , at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz . She was intelligent , conservative , polite and genuine . One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy , romance , suspense and heartfelt moments . I loved this movie . What a flick , what a flick ! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this , be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was , like , freaking out ! Go see it or be a bum - bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made . I love it , I wanna own this movie ! I love Emma Roberts now , too . She 's like a mini - Bree Van De Kamp from DH . Love it , love it .	1
While the ' special effects ' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some , I have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when I first saw it at around 8 years of age . The story of this girl 's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years , and I have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything I have seen.The fact that this is a true story , and the fact that I was only a child when I first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie . Each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s I would be riveted to the television , drinking in each scene with an interest I can not explain . I suppose watching this for the first time as an adult ( and with a jaded view of the world ) it may not be as enjoyable to some . I actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so I could show this movie to my son.This , like many other movies , is not for everyone . If you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories , are partial to Peru / Macchu Picchu and/or the Amazon , then I believe you might enjoy this movie as much as I have been enjoying it for the past 30 years .	1
This is one of the best military films ever made . And it is great because of its focus on values . It 's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor , loyalty , love , and determination.Gooding and DeNiro are superb in the lead roles . It 's wonderful to see the Master Chief 's racism evolve toward respect and love through Carl Brashear 's determination , drive , and yes , sense of honor . The title indicates the source of their bond . I never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant Carl Lumbly 's portrayal of Carl 's father , Mac Brashear , was . In a way , it 's a cornerstone of the film in that it 's Carl 's memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times.I am selective about what films I purchase . This is one of those rare ones that I want on my shelf . It will be seen many times in the future , I 'm sure .	1
Hey look , deal with it , there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black America than this . Although I think this story is weak , my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story , which I have mentioned , blows.This was made in the mid-80 's and is horrible in the music / score department . It 's funny to see Oprah as a latter - day crack - whore type.The scene where Bigger stuffs Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator . Pure classic cinema . First off , I do n't care how drunk you are , you will react to 1200F degree flame ( no matter how bad your acting ) . But they really milked that scene ... it was comical . I 'll tell you what though , I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn in a faux death ; she annoys me .	0
SPOILERS : I 'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews . It was awful . The script and voice acting alone ruined it . Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game . You almost pray for their deaths . And worst of all , there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in The Beast Within.The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing . If you 're expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story , forget it . This game 's story has very little to do with vampires . You wo n't even see any till about the very end and even then , you wo n't get to fight them.The story has radical , and pretty much blasphemous , views of Christianity . I 'm amazed it got off the drawing board . I 'm not even Christian and I found it offensive . Mostly , the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure . The kidnapping of a royal baby , which should have been the focus , really gets pushed aside . There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby . In fact , he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks.The graphics are pretty bad . The characters move about at a snail 's pace even on the best of systems . They are chunky and outdated . And it 's hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred.The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes an awful turn , too . I really do n't know why it was so horribly rushed , but they do sleep together . And it 's not fun . Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he does n't think she 's the one for him . And he seems really grossed out that they slept together . But he 's so unlikeable throughout the game , that you almost do n't even care at that point . His dialogue was the worst in the game . And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game . By the end of the game , Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter . I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were.I found the story to be annoying and boring . I was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires . And I was expecting to get to see and fight vampires , maybe even have Gabriel or Grace turn into one . But no . Instead , the story focused on the author 's warped vision of Christianity . What a shame . Here they had the elements for a great adventure , and instead we got this.For me , the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end . We do get a few action style puzzles at the end . But it was n't worth suffering through the entire game to get to them.I ca n't really recommend this game . I had gotten it back when it came out , years ago , and I hated the game engine so much that I shelved it for years . I only recently dusted it off to see what I 'd been missing . And now , I 'm very sorry that I did . My favorite characters were ruined . I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series . And I hope they get it right next time . It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment .	0
Shamefully , before I saw this film , I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.I had to do some research , in order to assure myself she was n't actually afflicted , as was her character , with ( well ? ) , what she was afflicted with . I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady . She pulled it of flawlessly.Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants , and needs , of a unique young lady , could be interpreted as tender , and romantic ? Well , they can be , when the right performers present them in the proper manner , as they did in this wonderful movie . I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie . I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth , but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did . Thank you for letting me express my opinion .	1
"Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this , despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being much bigger stars than her.Basically this is a bit of a spin on the "" Alien lands on Earth "" film . Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise . A bit of nudity and partial nudity , a pointless sex scene all feature along the way.The film stumbles through a few obvious set - pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs . I quite liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene.It was fairly obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending , it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed to Eggert ."	0
This really is an incredible film . Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States up for its dishonesty , subterfuge , and blatant disregard for human rights and self - determination . Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice . These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before.And in the cross hairs we see the USA , once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality . It 's heart - breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we 're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens . The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future . Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience . These Irish film makers deserve our gratitude . Long live Chavez.We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit . First phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are , and this documentary does a great job of doing just that .	1
This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean - Claud Vam Damme stars in this movie . There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie.The acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White Can not act at ALL.And this movie by far has to be one of Jean - Claud Vam Dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch Blood sport , KickBoxer or Sudden Death.Over all this movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10 .	0
""" The fallen ones "" falls under the waste of life ( WOL ) category . I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained . My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy . I felt sorry for the actors ( Wagner ) . I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot . It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all . In my humble opinion , The 42 foot mummy should have been 8 - 10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons . The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges . Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people . The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong ."	0
In 1993 , with the success of the first season of Batman : The Animated Series , Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit - show with producing a feature - length movie , originally slated for Direct - To - Video , but bumped up to theatrical status . It would become known as Batman : Mask of the Phantasm . Ten years after Phantasm , we have had an additional three feature - films released from the boys at the WB , Sub - Zero , Return of the Joker , and now , Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm : A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin . Now , Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.The animation is the sleeker , futuristic style that was utilized for Batman : The Animated Series ' fifth and sixth seasons ( AKA The New Batman Adventures ) . , it 's quite nicely done , and just as sleek as Return of the Joker 's animation . There is also some use of CGI , but it 's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub - Zero . The music was alright . Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score , although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans ' rodent - shaped hearts.Kevin Conroy , as always , does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman . It 's also great to have the old Batman : The Animated Series alumni back ; that includes Bob Hastings ( Commissioner Gordon ) , Robert Costanzo ( Detective Bullock ) , Tara Strong ( Barbara Gordon / Batgirl ; her cameo hints at the romantic - relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond ) , and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne , the old mob boss from the original series , appears for the first time since the fourth season.Overall , while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago , MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films . And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan , you will love the five - minute short Chase Me .	1
"Lil Bush is a 30 minute cartoon show comprised of 2 15 minutes episodes shown on Comedy Central . It takes place in a fictional , cartoonish Washington D.C. , and centers around the satirical , childish representations of George W. Bush , Condoleeza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney . Other politicians are also satirized in the same manner , and act as minor characters.The pilot of little Bush , much to this commentator 's expectations , proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production , which barely delivers on its featured promise : a satirical look at the current presidential administration . While one must admit that premise of the show does have SOME merit , even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired , execution that can only be described as sloppy at best , and downright awful at worst , has marred what little potential the show had.Lil Bush , which may be technically classified as "" satire "" , tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar ( but not particularly original , entertaining , or funny ) ways . The show 's consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording Bush / Cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television . As such , most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clichés , some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already . Comparing the Vice President to Darth Vader , for example , may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the Daily Show / Colbert Report / Letterman / Conan O'Brien / Leno monologue / any late - night - talk - show - ever , but it is not funny here . As if that were not enough , the show 's plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old , tiresome Bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program.In the show 's defense , when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke ( which seems to be a rarity ) it is often somewhat humorous . If the show were to expand its depth somewhat , and place its characters into new situations , exotic situations , rather than the same old mistakes and "" quagmires "" perpetuated by the Bush administration , therefore not having to rely on the same old Bush jokes over and over again , the show might be considered somewhat tolerable , and possibly even innovative.Ultimately , it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the Lil Bush series the most damage ; its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality , or its painfully narrow minded ambitions . It is reasonable to expect that Lil Bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans , that is , if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing ; so long as the program continues to lampoon the Bush administration thoroughly . Even so , the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is , a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire , and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation ; The Price is Right , perhaps ."	0
"dear god where do i begin . this is bar none the best movie i 've ever seen . the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best . why the script writers for this movie are n't writing big budget films i will never understand . another is the cast . it is great . this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure . i know some of you out there are probably thinking "" no way he has plenty better "" but no your wrong . raptor island is a work of art . i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors . i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER ."	1
This is the crappiest film I have ever seen but in all fairness it 's watchable and rather funny . I do n't think the film - makers intended it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality . It 's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow ( as it 's the middle of winter ) . He then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it 's own . This film is really stupid but it 's funny . The killings are hilarious . I would n't advise you to go and buy it ( like I did -the cover looked good!)but if it happens to be on TV one night and you 're up for a laugh then stick it on .	0
"This is hands down the worst movie I can ever remember watching . Everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded . The acting was horrible too . The camera work was n't bad but that still could n't redeem it . The writer / director of this film must suffer from down 's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career . I want the hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this crap . I would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this . I ca nt believe IMDb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but I feel that this movie is so bad that I must continue to warn others about it . The reason I came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the Kris Kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled "" Disappearances "" . I do n't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my DVD player but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time , pain and suffering . In conclusion , the director / writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street ."	0
A very engaging , intelligent , and well - made film . Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly . The cinematography is outstanding . The fight scenes are amazing . This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again . One of my favorites .	1
"With a title "" borrowed "" from Werner Herzog and liberal helpings of Kubrick , Haneke and Noe it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our British cinema churns out . "" Robert Carmichael "" ( for short ) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the Iraq war . The problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of "" extreme "" filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists . As a critique of the Iraq war , a film about youth violence ( by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual)is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about . There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this . Like Kubrick and Noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film . People liked "" Clockwork Orange "" and "" Irreversible "" because they liked the rapes and the violence , but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated . So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke ( a serious and moral filmmaker ) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years . ( I am not against violence in film . To do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered Alex in "" Clockwork Orange "" showing how Kubrick 's supposed intent was missed by miles . Gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art - film directors . )"	0
"The pre - release version of 1933 's "" Baby Face "" would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment . Mentored by a Nietszchean professor , Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father 's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank . Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault , the film has no victims , except Lily 's childhood , which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father . The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily 's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate . While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach , the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors . Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930 's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women.The plot moves fast , and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher . Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard - bitten roles , and she is in top form here . Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung . Only her African - American confidante , Chico , receives Lily 's affection , trust , and loyalty . In more enlightened times , the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris , who plays Chico , would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her . Stanwyck often appears overly made - up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris . However , despite Stanwyck 's tough demeanor , obvious tactics , and artificial visage , she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men , including Douglass Dumbrille , Donald Cook , and a young John Wayne.The preferred version of "" Baby Face "" is the 76-minute restored cut . The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts , which the longer cut restores and makes explicit . Perhaps Darryl Zanuck , who wrote the story under an assumed name , intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche , whose views on women were controversial . However , despite Alphonse Ethier 's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life , Lily 's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor . However , the philosophy is but a distraction . Short , fast paced , and entertaining , "" Baby Face "" is as contemporary in its morality as "" Wall Street . "" Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche , and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be "" greed is good . """	1
"Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart . Brennan ( Ben Tatum ) is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne ( Red River/ Rio Bravo ) . He 's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend . "" You 're wrong Mr. Dunston "" . Jeff Webster(Stewart ) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he can not desert Brennan . John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it . Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people . The loner can do neither and suffers for it.The caption above plays on Tatum 's assertion that he ca n't live without his coffee . This nicotine addiction proves fatal . Probably the first and last time on the screen.I recommend this film and now own the DVD ."	1
This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen ! ! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie . I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it . There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you ca n't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it . I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half . Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this movie for I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life .	0
"A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante . Their previous collaboration on the first season 's "" Homecoming "" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways . This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered . The supposed "" payoff "" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing . If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "" cleaning "" of the planet of it 's human infestation , why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion ? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King 's "" The Stand "" instead of having the male population butcher the females ? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous . The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it . I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm 's work but this was just unwatchable ."	0
This film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac ( Olivia Dunne ) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod,(Zack ) . The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture,(Jill Dunne ) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and Zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface . Jill Dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often . There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter Olivia dislikes and just can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs . In many ways , Olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and Nick Mancuso,(Richard Grant ) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner . This film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror . Enjoy	1
Until I saw this special on HBO , I had never heard of Eddie Izzard . I sure am glad that I have now ! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen ! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie . I could not stop laughing for the entire show . If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special !	1
Though Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story , Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them- this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years- still in love . The whole cast does a nice job from Aiello to John Mahoney- it shows a real slice of life . Though I saw this long ago- I am glad it finally catapulted Cage to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent . From the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments- this is a very entertaining movie .	1
"I saw this movie twice . I ca n't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie . I 'm also a movie / theatre director and I know what I speak . This is not Romania anymore , but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September . No story , no plot , nothing . No conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . Just empty images.What most of Romanians do n't know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . They really believe that is the reality in Romania . Also for teenagers . Pintilie should stop making movies . I do n't really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we 've got such an image in Europe . This WAS a reality , but is n't anymore . A good friend of mine from the Brithish embassy said : "" You have no idea what a long way Romanian people walked from Ceausescu "" ."	0

Picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s America and return to the Jarada rendezvous . Picard greets the Jarada correctly and a new day dawns between Humanity and the Jarada . This gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there	1
In the future of 2001 , Freddy is after the last surviving teenager of Elm Street . Forsaking ANY scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos ( come on .. Roseanne ? ? ? Tom Arnold ? ? ! ! ? ? WTF ? ) , this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got . Wow was this a piece of crap . Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stench of this movie go away . And when they hell did Freddy ever have a daughter ? ?

"If John Waters had written and directed "" House of 1000 Corpses "" after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object , the result would probably be something like "" The Blood Shed . "" It 's mildly entertaining for the first half hour , but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives , cutlery and pliers . Susan Adriensen ( Sno Cakes ) is incredibly annoying and Terry West ( Elvis Bullion ) is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the camera.Maybe the best thing about "" The Blood Shed "" is that it wo n't take most viewers very long to forget about it ."	0
"To call this episode brilliant feels like too little . To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too , 'cause there 's never been a far - from - great Sopranos episode so far . In fact , the title might be a smug invitation for those who are n't real fans yet : Join the Club ... Picking up where Junior left off ( putting a bullet in his nephew 's gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season ) , the story begins with Tony being absolutely fine . With no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him , he 's attending some kind of convention . Only he 's not speaking with his normal accent , and there seems to be something wrong with his papers : apparently , he is not Tony Soprano but Kevin Finnerty , or at least that 's what a group of people think , and until the mess is sorted out he ca n't leave his hotel.Naturally , in pure Sopranos tradition , that turns out to be nothing but a dream : Tony is actually in a coma , with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate , his family and friends worried sick and Junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened . Unfortunately it did , and Anthony Jr. looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father 's life.Dreams have popped up rather frequently in the series , often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists ( most notably in the Season Five show The Test Dream ) . Join the Club , however , takes the metaphysical qualities of the program , already hinted at by the previous episode 's use of a William S. Burroughs poem , and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way : Tony hallucinating about his dead friends ( the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning , four seasons ago ) is one thing , him actually being in what would appear to be Purgatory is radically different . The "" heavenly "" section of the story is crammed with allegorical significances , not least the name Tony is given ( as one character points out , spelling it in a certain way will give you the word "" infinity "" ) , and none of it comes off as overblown or far - fetched : David Chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set - ups just for their own sake ; it all helps the narrative . Talking about "" help from above "" in the case of Tony Soprano might be stretching it a tad , though ."	1
Monika Mitchell 's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence . I would n't say blood - soaked ; but there is insult and injury . Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen , but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after . There is always a producer 's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks . Well , the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts . The rewarding career is just a swing , push and shot away . Other cast members : Rene Rivera , Molly Parker , Jennifer Beals , Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh . Well , that 's show business ... or is it ?	0
Eddie Izzard is genius with his non - stop humor . I could listen all day . His unique approach to life is quite logical .

I mean COME ON that s funny cause its so bad ! It has such horrible jokes that they 're funny ! But after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap . I really started to fall asleep . Trust me though , the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time . Though I have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do . Heh heh mindless movie , which HAS to be nominated for the MST3 K line ! !"	0
The writer / director of this film obviously does n't know anything about film . I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey , because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun . < br />The story was awful , the characters were very one dimensional . For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans , that someone is kidding their self ( it was probably the writer / director ) . No poker fan in this world likes this movie . Even your money man hates this project . To go into a casino and play a few hands does n't give you the experience to write about poker . Keep your day job . And if it 's playing poker , then you must be hurt'n .	0
Oh , those sneaky Italians . It 's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the , in this case , author of the novel . Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema , mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it . James M. Cain 's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it 's a great movie nevertheless . This of course not in the least is due to the movie it 's great strong story , that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism . It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story , with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it . These early drama 's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch . Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end , when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts . The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.Nevertheless , I do n't really have much else negative to say about this movie . It 's simply a greatly made one , based on some equally great and strong source material . Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti , who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies.8/10	1

"Though derivative , "" Labyrinth "" still stands as the highlight of the mid - half of the six - year - old show . Finally a story allows Welling to show how he has grown as an actor . It 's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of "" truth , justice , and the American way "" on a weekly basis with very little variation . His performance , permitting him to show how one might react if he / she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie , was quite believable.Welling rose to the occasion marvelously.As always , Michael Rosenbaum , as the "" handicapped "" Lex , delivered , as did Kristen Kreuk as a too - sweet - to - be - believed Lana . Allison Mack , the ever - present Chloe , also scored as a slightly "" off - her - rocker "" version.The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama ."	1
"When this film opened back in 1976 , legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure . I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes.Apparently these people did n't understand the movie , which is not that hard to comprehend since it 's very esoteric , dark , and layered in ways that still astound me . Reading through many of the reviews here I find ( even after about 7 - 8 viewings over the years ) many elements of the film I had previously glossed over . But even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story , it 's still a cracking suspenser ... even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes Polanski 's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it 's two hour running time.Examining the source material --- an excellent novella by underrated novelist Roland Topor --- uncovers more intriguing layers . Polanski 's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order . Though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul , one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life , letting it direct him . He seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes . He finds himself gently pushed this way and that , but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless . This vague sort of wishy - washy - ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie , but there are hints of it early in the film too.Making a play for the apartment of a woman , one Mademouiselle Choule , who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt , appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted ( even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain ) . He soon finds , however , that he is paying for his "" good thing "" in more ways than he cares , as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic , control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life , such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door.Instead of taking a stand though , Trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation , and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution . He becomes obsessed with Choule , imagining himself to be like her , dressing like her , etc . as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity.If anyone has ever doubted Polanski 's fearlessness as an artist , they 'd be well - advised to see this film . His trademark black humor is prominently ( and sometimes embarrassingly ) on display here and --- god bless him --- he makes himself the butt of it . It 's a tour de force performance in one of the richest , riskiest , most Gothic horror movies ever made . That more people have n't seen it is a true crime ."	1
I was true to my regard for Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg . I watched the entire film with my family and some friends . I have no idea what the movie was about . After much discussion , we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts.It does n't hang together very well . It is too choppy , and there is little comedy . I am disappointed . It could have been much better.I waited months to see this film based on the liner notes.Don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of Mr. Glover 's and Ms. Goldberg 's films.It was a poor way to spend an evening .	0

A rousing adventure form director George Stevens ( before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948 's I REMEMBER MAMA and 1956 's GIANT ) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow . Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling 's poem of the same , GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century India . The noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold . Their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades , and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger - inspired space opera STAR WARS ( 1977 ) to the similarly - plotted RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC ( 1981).The biggest reason for the picture 's success , however , is the pitch - perfect performances by the film 's trio of extremely charismatic actors . Victor McLaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy , Cary Grant is the ultimate comic foil , and Douglas Fairbanks , Jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival Errol Flynn . The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon , and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what 's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous Sam Jaffe , who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength . A huge hit in its day ( the film was reportedly the second - biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful GONE WITH THE WIND ) , and it remains arguably the best film of its kind .	1
This film is awful . Not offensive but extremely predictable . The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60 's . The father , the principal at the school , is going through a mid - life crisis . Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students ' minds with some thought - provoking stuff , like think for yourself . The principal does n't agree with her teaching but she is pretty . You can connect the dots . His teenage daughter ( Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick ) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live . She gets some bad advice , hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning was n't being taught at her school . Shocking ! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV , this movie plays like a more adult version of an after - school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms .	0
"This truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters , just about every voluptuous middle - aged female in Hollywood , and a touching , funny love story . The Capomezza 's and the Malacici 's are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York . They are also at opposite -- extreme -- ends of the taste scale . Their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet . Naturally , they fall in love . On stage ! The mayhem and confusion that this causes , as the parents feud with each other and their kids , is played out for us against the backdrop of the Capomezza 's magnificently tasteless home , and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings.Besides the four over - the - top parents and the charming young lovers , the characters include a vaguely wise priest , a plain - speaking grandma , a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called The Blessed Roscoe , a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car , and two doves . There is not a sight gag or a punch line that does n't click in this fast paced movie.Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun . "" Capomezza "" could be interpreted as "" low - brows , "" and "" Malacici "" could mean "" stuck - up snobs . "" < br />If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes , you may not like this movie . If Bette Midler embarrasses you , you may not like it , because all of the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart . The rest of us should love it !"	1
"I suppose it was for Temple Matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse . SPOILERS : It is much similar to the original . Melody , Ariel 's new daughter is threatened by Ursula 's sister , Morgana . Morgana escapes , but keeps her promise to take Melody away from them . Did Ursula have a sister ? ! And she is not that great a villain as Ursula was . This is where there is similarity . Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured , but she does n't know a thing about it , because it all happened when she was a baby . A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out . She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian , who is not as funny or fun as in the original . She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana . Here is a similarity ; Morgana tricks Melody , making her happy by turning here into a mermaid . Meanwhile , Eric , Melody and King Triton look for her . To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton . So Melody does , because she does not know King Triton is her father . She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful . The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean , hate them because they are cowards . So they try to prove they are heroes and fail . That does not suit the little mermaid . And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear - bleeding . you know why ? Because the first had a great story . This one is not and is not magical . It is just an example of how bad many sequels are.Melody finds them and they help to take her to Atlantica to prove themselves . When they take the trident , Ariel finds Melody with Morgana . Melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to Morgana , then she shows her true colours once she grabs it . Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody . The penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight Morgana 's shark friend . Sorry I did not mention him earlier . They finally prove themselves . Eric , King Triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of the trident . Melody takes it , throws it to Triton and he ices Morgana ( literally ) . Then Ariel apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault . It was not ! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody , but they never say so . Triton offers Melody to live in sea or land . She in fact has a "" better idea "" . She uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer - folk can be together . Then everyone sings an awful song . THE END.Whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original . I do not dislike this because I am a teenager . I liked it when I was very very little . Then as I grew older I began to see what is bad about this film . young , young kids will enjoy it , but it is likely that when they are in primary school , they will forget about it . Normally I would think I over - judged a film and it was better than I remember when I watched it again , but not this one . It is even worse . Story is no exception . If you thought , by reading this that the story is good , read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points : Well , you know the story now . I am sorry for spoiling it for you , but I had to point out some bad parts of it . One of the worst things is the animation . Colour is awful . The original had beautiful colour . Watching this almost made me want to go blind . Even the illustrations and landscape design were not good . The original had beautiful , magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well , making it a joy to watch.The music is unbearable . Compared to the first , the music here is crap . Songs are not that well composed and Tara Strong ( I think that is her name ) who did Melody can not sing . She at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song . So much for having "" Melody "" as a name . And the music is not at all beautiful or moving . Little Mermaid 1 won an Oscar for it and it truly deserved it . This one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist.I did not like the voices . Several people who played characters from the first , did the same ones in this . Jodi Benson is a great singer , but now that she is older , no offence to her , her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore . And I am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this . If I was chosen for this film , just by reading the script , I can tell it would be a bad film . The characters are different now . Ariel is more wiser now , but annoying . They overdid her character , making her too mature . In sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason . She was sixteen in the first . There is little chance she changes . That is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life . Screenwriters should think of that . They should think of the character.Well , I suppose that is it for me . I hope you find my comment useful , because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view ."	0
' Anita and Me ' is a drama about growing up in multi - ethnic Britain , rather like ' Bend it Like Beckham ' , or more closely , ' East is East ' , with which it shares a 1970s setting . The tone is resolutely chirpy ( in spite of the dour Black Country accents ) , but the film lacks ' East is East 's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite . Moreover , the portrayal of the film 's central relationship , between an Asian girl and her white friend , is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it . I have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer , this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced , but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story . ' East is East ' was fun and sharp ; ' Anita and Me ' seems obvious and dull in comparison .	0
The worlds largest inside joke . The world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke.Emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . These are his goals . You ca n't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it UP ! The director and screenwriter ( Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.Apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . Without these asides , the audience would n't have noticed anything particularly strange . Humor is only effective if it does n't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .	0
Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people ? When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room , the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog , so one can hear neither , diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had . The scenes of Annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists , a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd . This entire movie is a cartoon , the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding . The discussion by the black women after flipper 's wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team , is ridiculous . The rampant racism might be possible to endure , but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this ' movie ' is too much . It was a technically poorly made movie . There is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making , the sound track , the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat . I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn , wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful . This is the first movie I have seen by this director and it will be my last .	0
"Yep , you read that right , kids . Michael Bay should 've studied this film before making either of his over hyped , overlong , overly pointless "" Transformers "" movies . "" Robot Jox "" is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the "" Transformers "" crew spent on Megan Fox 's personal trainer.Thankfully , this little robotic gem , initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Band 's Empire Pictures studio , seems to have developed a cult following over the years . I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War - era politics / stereotypes were already out of date by that time ( just the Bands ' luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released , eh ? ) , it 's still a pretty damn cool little B - Movie . They really do n't make'em like this anymore , or if they do , they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions.For those who are unfamiliar , here 's the Robo - scoop : We 're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust , large scale "" wars "" have been outlawed . Disputes between nations are now settled mano - a - mano ( or perhaps that should be machine - o - machine - o ) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots . Whichever ' bot walks away from the fight wins for "" his "" side . Gary Graham ( who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the "" Alien Nation "" TV series ) , plays "" Achilles , "" the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace ( a.k.a . the good guys ) history . Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts ( ten being the maximum number of battles before a "" Jock "" is retired ) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the "" Confederation "" ( i.e. The Russkies ! ) , the psychotic Alexander ( who is the most over the top "" evil Russian "" stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgren 's infamous turn as Ivan Drago in "" Rocky IV "" ) . The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles , but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain . A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout , but Achilles simply wants to bow out , hang up his helmet and move on with his life . Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more , I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns , behind the scenes skullduggery , and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow "" Jox "" before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.I hope I 'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction , because it is n't . "" Robot Jox "" is just plain fun . I 'll grant that it is a bit higher - concept than your average B - grade sci - fi movie , and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known ( especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green - screen trickery ) , it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire / Full Moon Pictures factory . The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion / model techniques , and the sets and costumes do n't look half - assed in the slightest . Empire Pictures and director Stuart ( "" Re - Animator "" ) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture . Unfortunately it did n't quite pan out for them ( or the studio ) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal . Bottom line : if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 + hours , feel free to rent a "" Transformers "" movie . By the end you 're likely to feel like you 've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game . If you want to have a rock'em , sock'em robot good time , pick up Robot Jox instead ."	1
"Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director 's distaste for war . The audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but , we learn that Europeans at the interval between WWI and WWII , had concerning pacifists(for lack of a better term ) . The speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film , are inspiring given the time . Although the revised edition , through the transfer technology of early foreign films , "" cuts - off characters heads "" at times , this film holds it 's own in many different aspects . Character analysis , lighting techniques , historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker.Pabst went on to Direct and put to screen Weil & Brecht 's "" Three Penny Opera "" , starring the original star , Lotte Lenya ."	1
"Another episode from childhood that , as an adult , I look back on with a different perspective . This was one of my favorite childhood episodes , one that really cemented my adoration of this show . However , on viewing this episode after 20 years , I 'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones , played for laughs and amusement , instead of the dramatic and well - constructed story lines in previous episodes in this , their first and best season . Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R&R too ! As Mr. Spock would say , the story just is n't logical but there are some amusing lines like , of course , Mr. Spock 's final one at the end -- when he asks the Captain , McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R&R and they answer in the affirmative , he raises an eyebrow and says "" Fascinating ... "" in only the way Mr. Spock could do that . An interesting story line , of course , the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing ( instead of the fake and often annoying "" amusement "" of Disneyland , for example ) , being able to have one 's wishes actually come true . Really , a great idea but not that well executed . And coming from Theodore Sturgeon , another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season , one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in.Now , here is a little trivia I learned on this very site : In 1987 , James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story . And I 'll quote the rest from this site : In 1968 he { Sturgeon } wrote "" The Joy Machine "" , a third script for the Star Trek TV series { Amok Time the other } , that was never shot . The main reason that it was n't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget . However , the script was adapted into a book by Sci - Fi writer James Gunn ( Star Trek # 80 , The Original Series ) and published by Pocket Books in 1996.I'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable , especially if one does n't think too much about it . Just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe ."	1
Well , well .... Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there , did n't he ? He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters ' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades , but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption ( or even some good advice ) might be found in the bad old Catholic church , the hipper - than - thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious . Worse still , Theresa Russell 's character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for , is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual . You know , the realm of the ignorant and superstitious , the sort of thing that the art - house cinephiles are supposed to be above . Oh , the horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention . People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives . But they probably wo n't . Sure , this film has some problems , notably Talia Shire 's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun , 1950s - style attire and all . And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations ( though Hitchcock 's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst ) . But , sadly , Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents .	1
This is one of the most brilliant movies that I have seen in recent times . Goes way above even any international movie of any repute . I am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved . Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact . Renuka Daftardar simply amazes as she speaks volumes through her eyes . There are a few scenes that stand out : When Gauri comes back from the city on Krishna 's wedding , she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years . Krishna notices a change in Gauri , but not a single line of dialogue is said . The entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes . There 's another towards the end when Krishna pleads to Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead . If you are not moved by that scene , you do n't have a heart.Watch this movie for sheer movie - making brilliance and acting capabilities .	1
"Story about four teenage girls growing up in California . Jeanie ( Jodie Foster ) is the most level - headed of the bunch -- but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother ( Sally Kellerman ) . Annie ( Cherie Currie ) is addicted to drugs , alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father . Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) has overprotective parents . Deirde ( Kandice Stroh ) thinks she 's more mature than the rest of them.This is nothing new from what we 've seen plenty of times before -- but this one has one big difference -- it 's accurate . I graduated from high school in 1980 ( when I first saw the film ) and I was surprised at how realistic it was . They got the dialogue , clothes and attitudes down completely right . Even the main song of the movie ( "" On the Radio "" by Donna Summer ) was a big hit before this came out . This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters . I knew girls in high school who were just like this ! The film is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again.The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance . The relationship between her and Kellerman ( who was excellent ) was realistic and well - done . Even Scott Baio ( who has a small role as a friend of the girls ) more or less realistically played a teen boy.A very good movie -- essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 . The film has a deserved R rating ( plenty of drug use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens . I give it a 8 ."	1
"This is really really bad . Lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job . But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric "" I got the evidence on you ! "" . ( Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i could n't find it on iTunes ) . Talk about seeing into the future ... Too funny for words . The rest of the movie is forgettable . The score and songs are more interesting than the script . Ditto the sequel . Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all . My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies . Does n't say much for the world 's viewing habits ."	0
I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15 . They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things . Now that I am approaching their age , I still remember , and find I understand many of the things my kids love . But this is pathetic . I can not say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there . They were reasonable . I do not see her as anything special . But this show is just so far below what I expected from her . The IMDb write up made it sound like potential . So , just for that , I started watching the first episode . I turned it off half way through . Anything else is better that that . Jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program . Well , Sarah , this adult is inly moved to turn you off . I just ca nt believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy . Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here , saving other shows from such an embarrassment .	0
When I rented this movie , I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it , I realized that the movie was less ( a lot less ) than what I expected . The actors were bad ( the doctor 's wife was one of the worst ) , the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie ( except for the murders ) , but this one is not a comedy , it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity . The title is well chosen except for one thing : they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands ! I give it 0 and a half out of 5 .	0
Really bad movie . Maybe the worst I 've ever seen . Alien invasion , a la The Blob , without the acting . Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue . Bad plot , bad fake tongue . Absurd comedy worth missing . Wash your hair or take out the trash .	0
I get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies , and they were not disappointed when I watched this one . I cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness . I ached for the family and I ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how . Denzel was fabulous as always , and so was Chris Walkin . Mickey Rourke , I did not even recognized though ; the years have not been kind to him . My husband is not one to re - watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore ! ! ! ! ) He has watched this movie 5 times now and I am going to have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time I was watching .	1
Fred Gwynne , Al Lewis , Sid Caesar , and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny , funny movie . The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster ( Al Lewis ) , wife Lily ( Yvonne De Carlo ) , and his son and daughter . Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family . When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two . The two now have to clear their names before it 's too late . You 'll laugh out loud just like I did .	1
"I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after seeing the FANTASTIC 2001 live action version of the film . The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtably be far better than George Lucas ' Star Wars "" prequel "" trilogy ( Episodes 1 - 3 ) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!I remember seeing the animated version as a child , and I did n't quite understand the depth of the film at that time . Now that I have read the books , I understand what the whole storyline is all about . To be sure , some of the characters are quite silly , ( Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying , almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One , ( AWFUL ! ) ) but , I have to say it follows the book rather closely , and it goes into part of book two , The Two Towers . The good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it 's time . The bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through The Two Towers without any result of Frodo 's quest to destroy the one ring , and the animation looks quite dated compared to today 's standards . < br />Overall , not AS bad as many say it is . BUT , the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of The Lord of the Rings ! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously ! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books , which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film , so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter ! I 'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter anyday!A 7 out of a scale of 1 - 10 , far LESS violent than the 2001 live action version , but NOWHERE near as good ! For diehard fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings ."	1
"I think the movie was pretty good , will add it to my "" clasic collection "" after all this time . I believe I saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie . Maybe some of the more esoteric points defy "" logic "" , but a great many religious matters accepted "" on faith "" fail to pass the smell test . If you 're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie . Is it just me or has anyone else noticed the Aja - Yee Dagger is the same possessed knife Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in "" The Shadow "" . No mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here ( IMDB ) , but I would bet a dollar to a donut it 's the same prop ."	1
The symbolic use of objects , form editing , the position of characters in the scene ... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had . The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses , the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards , in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken . Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see ; the boxing ring , the wedding ring , the bracelet the lover buys , and the love triangle at the heart of the story .	1
Friday the 13th step over ! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there . I won this movie in a contest at college , and it was a waste of money even if it was free . Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something . At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me . I 'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again .	0
"The Invisible Ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi . Karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others , even his wife . His already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.Lugosi plays the consummate professional , who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone , but still seems to have no real close friends . This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well . It is hard , however to hear his accent and believe he is French . < br />The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "" junk science "" but , in a way , even the junk science makes it work well . Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic , they are as "" relevant "" today as they were when the movie was made . And they are also as forward reaching- and always will be . < br />This is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again . I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit through it five more times . The acting is marvelous and the science is amusing . I highly recommend it ."	1
"The story is somewhat stilted , what with the main character 's sudden reversals of fortune , but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis 's portrayals of Philip Carey , the naïve obsessed lover and Mildred Rogers , the unworthy object of his affections , raise this film considerably above standard melodrama.Sensitive , cultured Philip , who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for Mildred is not unlike a character Howard was to play a few years later -- Ashley Wilkes , the Southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough Reconstruction era . Philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picturehe does n't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he 'll never make it as a painter . It is perhaps this passivity , these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does.Although Leslie Howard is memorable , today "" Of Human Bondage "" is mainly thought of as a Bette Davis picture , perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to get the part of Mildred , and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy . Mildred may have a grating voice , but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel , making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did . Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional , she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her . One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being "" fine "" enough . ( The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this).Most of the supporting characters are also effective , particularly Norah the sensible romance writer who loves Philip but knows she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who has Mildred 's beauty and Norah 's decency and emerges as the deserving woman Philip is rewarded with in the end . The only character I found hollow was Sally 's eccentric , ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era.A classic that deserves it reputation ."	1
Warning ! Spoilers ahead!<br / > SPOILERS < br /><br / > I 've seen movie in German , so it might be , that I missed some clues.<br / > Despite some weakness in the plot , it 's a movie that came through to me . I liked especially Lexa Doig 's acting . Sometimes I got impression , that she * is * Camille . But I ca n't stop wondering , what happened at the end with Bob , Cassie and baby . I belive , she , after initially being set on Bob , eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him . Otherwise it 's a bit strange , that she would carry his baby and love it . It 's up to viewer to decide - and I do n't like such endings . Dean Cain was as good as ever , Eric Roberts .. well , I 've seen him better but also worse.<br / > I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story.<br / > Bottom line is , I liked it very much .	1
"I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site . I would have to say it was worth the effort . However , you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes . If you do n't have the staying power , get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.Now to the film , what I say will contain "" spoilers "" and if you do n't mind , here goes : < br />Alexandre is a promiscuous bum , a womanizer and a gigolo . He lives with an older woman called Marie . Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex . Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants . The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with . Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her . At this point , Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else . < br />By chance , Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship . Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past . Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex 's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot . Finally at the end , it 's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex 's child and Alex asked her to marry him . We assume ( as aforesaid with Gilberte 's situation ) Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family . There is hope ! < br />With the title of "" La Maman et la putain "" , I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Françoise Lebrun 's character of Veronika . She was a whore and then she became the mother . Hence , the mother and whore is the same person ? Anyway , what do I know ! French films are mostly ( not all ) very chatty , aimlessly political , preaching , theatrical , insipid , lamenting and full of quotes . Lebrun and Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed . < br />Not a bad effort . 7/10 ."	1
"Fantastically putrid . I do n't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid "" Doc Savage .

Badly made . Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull . Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival.Everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as I - what was the point of even making the film ? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly . I am astonished that this film has been given a release - very , very disappointing and a waste of my time . Sorry , terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake . What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting .	0
What an absolutely stunning movie , if you have 2.5 hrs to kill , watch it , you wo n't regret it , it 's too much fun ! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there is n't anything more other than him , I still liked it . The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times , you really start liking it .	1
I bought this DVD after seeing it highly ranked here . It 's just a short 20 minutes zombie film . Nothing special about it except for the music perhaps.Don't buy it ! Not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it . Only if you 're really bored ...	0
Every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human . Lawrence Kasden done this again . I always felt theBg Cill was the anthem of it 's age and he has managed to do it again in Grand Canyon . Every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it . This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice . The juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius . I have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film . Danny Glover and Kevin Kline do their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless . Thank you again Mr. Kasden	1
"I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger , and gradually getting less so , until getting jaded enough , as I 'm sure many other viewers have become , so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm . "" The Dentist "" turned that around.The setup seems simple : a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths , and perhaps bodies as well . A clever twist , though , is that the dentist is the film 's protagonist , so instead of being some one - dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation , his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable . The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims , and instead of hoping for justice to come to him , I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life.What really "" makes "" a horror movie is the violence . And "" The Dentist "" does it better than any other film I can think of . First off , the film has tons of tension , which is something that modern gore films tend to lack . In one scene ( ) , the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time . As he reaches into the child 's mouth , you hope that , for the dentist 's and the child 's sake , the encounter ends without injury . I wo n't spoil what happens . Second , when the gore does come , it hits all the worst , squirmy nerves . Once again , I wo n't give anything away.Of course , being a movie that you 've never heard of , it does have flaws . Most importantly , it 's exclusively for horror fans . Also , as another reviewer mentioned , by taking place over a span of just a few days , we do n't really get any background on the characters . And the tension drops a little bit during the very end . But really , the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is , and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven.It 's strange , after years of being accustomed to movie gore , to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood . "" The Dentist "" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable , and for this it earns my full approval ."	1
The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in Hollywood . Even John Ford never made that many with so much quality . The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are . Ford 's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them . Or at least two . < br />The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase . Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River . Chase wrote far country , bend of the river , and probably some others . But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine , but then very few films , western or otherwise are . < br />Each of the five films of Mann have huge gaps , or is it six , lets see . Bend , Far , Man of the West , Furies , Winchester 73 , and yep , six , Naked Spur . Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene , with fairly glaring lapses . Yet so does Red River , which is still the single greatest western ever made . So perfection is n't everything . < br />But The Far Country has huge , huge holes . It 's mawkish , and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns . The rest is pretty pedestrian , with the usual exception of Mann 's camera . Mann 's camera is a one man course in cinematography . It is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film . It is almost never in the wrong place , never . < br />The Far Country has one amazing moment . And as usual it comes from Stewart . Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man . He is absolutely amazing : look at him in Bend , Far , Winchester , and Man from Laramie : in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from Dachau , in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence , it looks so convincing that you wince , and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man , well you find yourself looking for the burn marks . What an actor . Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room , also as well as anybody ever did it . < br />But that was Mann 's territory : look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West . As painful as any fight scene ever recorded . Cooper while not being quite as convincing as Stewart , nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight . In short , nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as Mann . < br />What a great , great director . < br />See every western he ever made . They are his real monuments , even if all are scetchy . But so what . When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody , including Ford . And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone , period.Thanks , Anthony .	0
I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered . NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews , and EVERYONE who actually saw it ( that I know ) absolutely loved it ... The advertising campaign is disgrace / disaster / blunder.Opened at # 4 behind ... #1-Rush Hour , which I have not seen , average IMDb score of 7.4.#2-The Bourn Ultimatum , which I have seen , awesome movie but 3rd week out , average IMDb score of 8.7 ( deserving I would say).#3-The Simpsons Movie , which I have seen , okay movie but 4th week out , average IMDb score of 8.1 ( a bit high in my opinion).#4-Stardust , average IMDb score of 8.4 ( lower then Bourn , but that 's been our for 3 weeks).Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time ! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale   Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on - and - on ... Awesome movie , go see it !	1
""" Jag är nyfiken  Yellow "" is a lot of fun . Like at least one other reviewer , I was , on numerous occasions , laughing out loud . Yellow is energetic , playful , self - aware , explorative . Do n't expect Bergman here . This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues , read * contradictions * , that the nation and the world were facing . At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social - political documentary , with Lena , the main character , and others interviewing both common people and politicians ( e.g. Olaf Palme at home ) . At other times , Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary . All the while , Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena 's life - her home life , her loves , her political views , her view of herself . She is a complete person  complex , flawed , contradictory , happy , sad , curious . And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director , Sjöman , and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena . It is this that , for me , really gives Yellow wings . Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways , reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice , but their presence is itself another layer of the film ; they are filming themselves filming themselves . I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video , ad infinitum , with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish . I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind . While "" Jag är nyfiken  Yellow "" may not be everyone 's cup of tea , it is certainly intelligent , witty , refreshing , ebullient , and authentic ."	1
"People are being too hard on the film . Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to "" review "" it.The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down . Then the fun begins as everyone about him also "" go down"".Just think JFK and all the people associated in any way with his assassination , who 's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you 'll appreciate what is implied in this film.I think it 's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred . Though the EXACT story line my not have been followed ( hindsight here after reading Jim Maars "" Crossfire "" ) but it 's what is implied that is of interest.I'd love to get a copy of it to view it again . In light of what is known today , The Domino Principle is right on ."	1
When I saw this movie , I could n't believe my eyes . Where these hilarious creatures , dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth , really meant to be scary ? Or where they designed to have a good laugh ( I sincerely hope so ) . If you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them ( better ; dragging them across the screen ) . The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part . It is one big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs into a new category : So unbelievable crappy you 'll be laughing from beginning to end . ( I 'm not even gon na try to comment on the acting or all the other things )	0
Actually , Goldie Hawn is from Washington ( Takoma Park , Maryland ) , but I digress . This is sort of a Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of movie , with some variations but the same premise . I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn . The story is interesting , but it 's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot 's life . It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time . It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous , I had to laugh . ( POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD ) . It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up . And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful . Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life .	1
DD films were damn corny , damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least < br />This film is n't just a comedy but a mix of melodrama , romance everything < br />Every drama scene is blown out of proportion < br />The comedy is funny but corny too Yet the film keeps you entertained , those days Govinda films were loud , crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed < br />David Dhawan does a okay job Music is okay < br />Govinda acts well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts Kader is as usual Gulshan , Prem Chopra are typecast Shakti is hilarious	0
This movie is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan 's administration as incompetent and bungling . Some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis , but I 'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie . My first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by Oliver Stone , but I was wrong this time . There are apparently many others .	0
I am proud to say I own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70 's Crown International drive - in sexploitation comedy cheese on DVD . It 's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70 's vibe to it . It does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail . Sure , it 's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic -- the main teen goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls , the respect of his friends , and a chance to show - up a local van - racing bully -- but it 's way too dopey and good - natured to hate . Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead , Deborah White as the main object of Getz 's affection is a definite cutie , Connie Lisa Marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe , and sneering beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver ( a 60 's biker movie perennial ) is wonderfully hateful as the brutish Dugan Hicks . A pre - stardom Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute riot as Getz 's cranky carwash owner boss Andy , a lovably cantankerous ne'er - do - well slob who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit . I especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny up -- one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over Danny 's torso ! And Sammy Johns ' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week . In short , it 's great groovy retro-70 's fun !	1
"Yet ANOTHER movie about a group of less - than - intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short - cut or , in this case , to visit a run - down side show attraction . The results , as expected , are not at all good , as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic , in - bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before . The father , who is apparently a professionally photographer , just HAS to stop and take pictures of the place , only to find that it still inhabited . The various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions , only to be scared away . Thinking they made it safely on their way , the van tire explodes ( surprise ! ) , leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town , which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks ( surprise!).This film plays out as expected , with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks . There is some fighting back on the families part , but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film , as they are badly executed . There is nothing remotely original here , unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film . The acting is about as bad as I have seen in quite some time by everyone involved ( it is pretty bad when your cast is out - acted by the cast of "" Camp Blood ) . The special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television.Still , though , despite all the negatives , I somewhat enjoyed this film . It definitely has a "" so bad it 's good "" vibe to it . I made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once I got past the ridiculously clichéd plot , terrible acting , and cheesy special effects . Though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry , particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.Bottom line , I can list countless films that if you have seen them , you have seen this . The difference is most of those film are better . Though not a complete waste , this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.My Grade : D"	0
"As a collector of movie memorabilia , I had to buy the movie poster for this film which , now that I 've finally seen it , has to be the best thing about it . There 's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man . However , there 's nothing more awful to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long image of the melting man . At first I thought this movie was pure garbage but then I realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh . The character of Dr. Ted Nelson has to be the most wishy - washy persona ever brought to the big screen . His dialogue is so trite it 's unbelievable ! ( "" It 's incredible ! He seems to be getting stronger as he melts!)And could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to "" help "" him ? If this movie was meant to scare its audience , I think it missed its calling ."	1
"The 1983 BBC production of "" Jane Eyre "" starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton ( LOVE HIM ) has always been and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre . If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book , it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day . But watching this one almost equals to reading the book . I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little , and they inspired me to read the book . At the time I did n't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book . Recently , I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed . It was only 2 hours long and did n't have many important scenes from the book ( such as my favorite gypsy scene ) . After that I fell in love with This "" Jane Eyre "" even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story ( the other versions do n't , if you have n't read the book ) . < br />The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent . It 's true that Timothy Dalton is a very handsome actor ( handsome enough to play Butler in "" Scarlet "" , and Julius Caesar ) , but he is so great as Rochester that I ca n't imagine anybody else playing this role . And Zelah Clarke is , without a doubt , the only Jane that follows the description of the book . The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors . Jane looks so modest and naive , just as Bronte describes her ( although she does n't look 18 , but do you actually pay attention to that ? ... ) < br />Some people say that this "" Jane Eyre "" is too long , but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version . Some say the movie is dull and boring because Jane is not passionate enough , or because there are not enough "" kissing scenes "" . I hate when they make Jane Eyre some "" Hollywood movie "" with inappropriate kissing scenes . You do n't have to include "" crazy , madly in love "" scenes to show the love between Jane and Rochester . And both Zelah and Timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed ! ! I am 19 years old , and many girls of my age refer to this film as "" boring and old - fashioned "" . But I can only feel sorry for them because they do n't appreciate the purity and beauty of it . After all , the novel is set in 19th century , and that old - fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book . < br />I do n't think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one . No matter who plays Jane and Rochester in other movies , the real Jane and Rochester ( for me at least ) will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton !"	1
I truly enjoyed this film . The acting was terrific as was the plot . Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for . The only part of this flick I would change was the ending . The death of the creature was far too gruesome for the Sci Fi Channel.There were some interesting religious messages in this film . Jeff Combs obviously played a Messiah figure and the creature ( or shark if you prefer ) represented the anti - Chirst . There were some particularly frightening scenes that had that ' end of the world feel ' . I only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature . I know many people wo n't get the references to Christianity , but if you watch close you 'll get it .	1
' How To Lose Friends & Alienate People ' is a superb film . A hilarious film from start to end . A lovely entertainer . Enjoyed it . Thumps Up ! < br />Performances : Jason is fantastic .

I did n't really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it ( hype about the Satanism etc etc etc ) as the trailers in the last movie I saw looked pretty interesting.Oh dear , Roman Catholic mythology ? Not my idea of a good scare and honestly , I just felt like watching a really good , scary movie , not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes!I'll try to keep away from the spoilers ( ! ) but I found it very odd that an Atheist , who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest , could suddenly end up with Christ 's wounds ( are n't stigmata supposed to be deeply religious ? ? ) I mean , she hangs out with losers , does loser stuff , behaves like a typical rebel et al , and here she is displaying the wounds of Jesus Christ ? ? Come on!Scenes of her crucified , head thrown back , screaming , blood everywhere , became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times . It was neither frightening or scary , just repulsive . It did , however , become quite painful to watch - those flicking scenes were highly annoying ... CONCLUSION : If your a Catholic , defintly do n't see this . If you 're not , still do n't see it .	0
"I can not see why filmmakers remade this movie . < br />The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic . Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor . He has no passion in his play . Also the action in the original "" Getaway "" was fantastic . But the remake has no action ! It is almost boring despite the fact that the film - making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 . < br />I do n't understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico . I think this is a mistake in the story.So i think that there was no need to remake it , or if they decided to remake a classic , they must choose an excellent actor for the first role , like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ..."	0

"Tweaked a little bit , ' Nothing ' could be a children 's film . It 's a very clever concept , touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes , and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of ... what goes against everything more than , literally , "" nothing "" ? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives . All that 's left is what they do n't hate , and a big empty white space . It 's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film , especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot . It focuses on pretty much one subject , but that 's prime Vincenzo Natali territory . If you 've seen ' Cube ' , you know already that he tends to like that type of situation . The "" nothing "" in this movie is apparently infinite space , but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic , if only because there 's literally nothing else , and nowhere else to go . The actors sell it , although you can tell these guys are friends anyway . Two actors from ' Cube ' return here ( Worth and Kazan ) , but are entirely different characters . They change throughout the story , and while they 're not the strongest actors in the world , they 're at least believable.The reason I say this could be a children 's film under the right tweaks , is because aside from a few f - bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence , the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids . So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore , especially considering there is n't very much of it . This could 've gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue . There is very little objectionable about this film , but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it . I only say that 's a shame because not because I support censorship , but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.At any rate , this is a reasonably entertaining film , albeit with a few dragged - out scenes . But for literally being about nothing , and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing , they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film ."	1
"Maléfique is a very interesting movie . It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures . The central concept is great , three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth ( who the audience identify with ) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell.The atmosphere is well - woven , it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes ' in the Château d'If ( prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo ) . The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell , particularly the character we are meant to identify with ( Carrère - a white - collar criminal whose crime is not specified , but it 's obliquely suggested might be fraud ) . On one occasion Carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him ; we never leave the cell , the claustrophobia is unbroken . There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell , and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall . So even though the film appears to be very modern , it has a very old world feel of incarceration.The characters are intriguing . We have Marcus , a violent pre - op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette ( French for Daisy ) a heavily retarded young man . Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful , and unfortunately this included his baby sister , hence his current predicament ( I like this comment on internalisation , very primitive ) . Lasalle is a withdrawn , possessed elderly man , in for brutally murdering his wife.The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you , and there 's a ritual that goes with that . I think that 's what disturbs me the most , seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically . It has a real life ring to it . The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well , every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong . I 'm actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self - destructive.I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters do n't really reinforce the message consistently , particularly with Carrère , also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film , not in terms of a successive revelation either . I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish , more by design than execution , such as the famous "" vagina eye "" , and the sodomy of Lasalle , for me , totally hollow images.At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with , and some things do n't seem logical , for example we 've been clumsily led to believe different things about Carrère 's child . This does n't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird , a "" pure "" horror movie . There is no comedic dross or genre segueing , like Cube ( 1997 / Natali ) , the obvious movie to compare it to , it 's a total immersion experience , where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters . This last comment I make about it being a "" pure "" experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian . He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him . The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge . This prompts Lasalle to go insane . That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge . It 's something I myself have felt.One final comment is that two of the quite well - received comments on the board have confused the characters ' names . To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character , simply click on Philippe Laudenbach 's page and you will see he was born in 1936 ."	1
In my humble opinion , this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script . ( OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.)But to me that 's all there is . Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it 's played by George Wendt who looks like he 'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston . Jason Alexander is passable , but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone . As I mentioned , it 's good to have a version of the stage script now , but I hope the young out there , who have never seen a musical , DON'T judge them all by this .	0
"As the jacket proclaims , this film is "" Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited , "" and , yes , it is mesmerizingly beautiful . The timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from Goldsworthy 's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity.And so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in -- or in the words of Matthew Arnold from "" Dover Beach"":Listen ! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back , and fling , At their return , up the high strand , Begin , and cease , and then again begin , With tremulous cadence slow , and bring The eternal note of sadness in.At one point near the end of the film Goldsworthy says that "" Words do their job , but what I 'm doing here says a lot more . "" As a wordsmith myself I take no offense and not for a moment do I think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates , is indeed something more than mere words can say.At another point he remarks on "" What is here to stay ... and what is n't . "" That is his theme.I think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time ; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral . The idea was , that by emphasizing how short - lived are even the mightiest works of humans , a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed.Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy 's work is in this sort of expression . He painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it , or places it in the river where it will be swept away ; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality.Both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it . And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural . Thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that Goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity , but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along.This is art as art should be , akin to the spiritual.In a sense Goldsworthy 's work is an inarticulated understanding . It is an experience purely of time and form . In a sense his work "" answers "" Shelley 's famous poem "" Ozymandias "" by saying , even as the tide washes the work away , and even as the river dissipates the expression , even so the art lives on because of our experience of it . Similarly one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out , and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished , they are given to the wind , so that we might know that all is flux.Yet , in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos . Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer ( of necessity I would say ) and all his works , even the unsuccessful ones , he tells us , are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not.This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed . It is one of the most beautiful documentaries that I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual ."	1
"It 's easy to make really general comments about a film like this . The fact that it 's one of the only remaining Japanese films from this era causes people to say that it "" started Japanese cinema "" and was "" unlike anything the west ever made . "" The latter of these two comments is particularly false as Kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off "" Caligari "" on more than one occasion . But style was meant to be imitated , and does n't take away from this film 's importance . What we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles , opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities . For this purpose , the madhouse is the ideal setting , and the writers knew this . This is a landmark film , and every effort should be made to track it down.5 out of 5 - Essential"	1
Interesting ? Hardly . The ' scientific evidence ' the movie provides for its point ( which is basicly that Jews are a cancer ) is so stupid and lame , it 's almost laughable ( if we did n't know what happened in that era).Important ? Nah . I ca n't imagine Germans ( even at that horrid time ) would like or believe this movie . Compare it to Riefenstahl 's Triumf des Willens . Now that was I movie I was impressed with . This is just silly garbage.'Best ' part is a scene from M ( one of my all - time favorites ) where ( the jew , as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us ) Lorre plays a child - molester and murderer . In the eyes of these film - makers , only a depraved mind can do so . Uh - huh . Did n't know M was Hitler 's favorite movie , right?No , it 's just plain STUPID . Even for it 's nazi - propaganda genre . 2/10 .	0
"I found this movie to be a great idea , that did n't deliver . It seems they found a way to build suspense , but could n't stage their payoffs very well . In one case the police , are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers . They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record . At the same time , the kidnapped man ( Mason ) escapes through the elevator shaft . After all the build up , the police arrive at the same time he gets free , which is very anti - climatic to say the least . There are also large narration scenes that take us "" inside the thinking "" of the terrorized husband and wife , which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it . We are fully aware of their tension , and the voice - over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear , as Hitchcock proved time and again , is far more effective . The greatest disappointment , is to sit through the whole movie , and the get the quick , rather bland ending . I mean it just ... ""ends "" in a snore ."	0
Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch 's works is his most accessible . This time , rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares , Lynch provides a reflective , fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both . The simple true story of an Iowa farmer ( Richard Farnsworth ) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged , stricken brother , there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes ( some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland , filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis ) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable . Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way , allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life , and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter ( whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney ) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances , one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson , whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time . But that 's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best . To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent , disturbing reputation , this is an excellent place to begin ; for those who know his work , this is one of the finest in his repertoire .	1
A talking parrot is n't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film , but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant , heartwarming film that will delight the whole family . It manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during Marie and Paulie 's separation , and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion . The animal training is well - done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time . Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success , though this film was n't a highlight of 1998 , unlike Saving Private Ryan . This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember . Paulie 's story is a moving , sad , happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner , you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way . Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion . 9/10	1
When converting a book to film , it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author 's intended tone or conveyed concepts , rather than ignoring the author altogether . While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewart 's children , it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good , enriching , strengthening experiences of homesteading her land . The book details her life on her and her husband 's adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier ; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances , though they lived dozens of miles apart . The film , however , takes a standard stance for the time it was made , portraying this woman 's experience as harsh , unforgiving , and nearly pointless . Perhaps the director was bringing some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie ( as some film aficionados have said ) , but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak , odious landscape devoid of friends or hope . Do n't waste your time with this movie ; read the book instead .	0
Kurosawa , fresh into color , losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo 's slums . Kurosawa stretches for a style that was , in my opinion , his antithesis- that is to say , I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture . Poorly paced , poorly conceived , this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work . While Ikiru , while being mundane and depressing , was still interesting and well paced , and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy handed or boring , do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content , with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa pictures.Be warned , this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by .	1
The performance by Om Puri , Smita Patil , and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely , along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani . The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great . < br />I have not seen another movie like this . It is one whole , each piece so nicely fit in the plot . You can not not be impressed by this movie . < br />Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and ' baap ' of Om Puri . Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty 's at Sadhashiv 's place is absoulely stunning . Smita Patil does not play a main role , but her part is also not distracting from the main plot . < br />And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . He is also the ' guru ' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya . < br />A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema .	1
Exceedingly complicated and drab . I 'm a bright guy , but this was just too much for a tired brain . It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing . Probably better for the US market . GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why.Still the sand dunes are pretty . The nail pulling is nasty . The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery . The cricket is good to see.Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this , despite it being over 2 hours long . Thank heavens they shortened it . Admittedly we do n't get to the pictures much , but the last film we saw , Walk the Line , was 10 times better and I do n't really like Johnny Cash . My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there 's that ..... am I nearly there yet ? < br />How about now	0
"I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart , but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites . It does n't wow me as much at 17 , but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie . Kids will definitely love it and wo n't mind the flaws , and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film . None of the film was preachy in any way , in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness . I will admit though that the story is on the thin side , and some scenes like Screweyes 's death(which still freaks me out ) may be a tad on the scary side . But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation . The music by James Horner is very beautiful , and the song featured is memorable , catchy and amusing . I really liked the characters , Louie is probably the most in - depth of them all , but the dinosaurs were at least engaging . Martin Short 's clown was both hilarious and emphatic , the part when he tells Screweyes "" I quit ! "" had me in stitches . My favourite is Screweyes though , an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent . If anything though , I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could 've been more developed in terms of depth . The script , while not Oscar - worthy , has its funny and heart - warming parts , and should keep kids and adults entertained . The voice acting for me was what made the movie . John Goodman , Martin Short , Rhea Perlman , Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances , but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable . All in all , this is a good movie . I do n't get the rating , honestly I do n't . Sure this film is n't perfect , and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time , but it is good fun . 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"	1
W. Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic . If so , much must have been missing from the film version here . Phillip 's ( Leslie Howard ) attraction to Mildred ( Bette Davis ) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post - breakup retelling of a relationship from the man 's point of view . Being a family lawyer I 've heard many such accounts ; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct , and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.Indeed , unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker , this is an uncomfortable movie to watch . Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity , but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat , with predictable results . Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life , but that period did n't occur here . In fact , by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later.I note how Howard 's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed . It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability . Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough . Phillip is , for most of the movie , a student ; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger , and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov , as it will . And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm .	0
This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see . I thought it was just another documentary , but it really is something else . It does n't try to teach you anything , it shows you how life works in nature.I wo n't talk about the quality of the pictures , because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.Earth is funny , tense and sad . It can make you laugh , it can make you cry . Sometimes both at the same time . This is the first movie that made me cry , not because you feel sorry for the animals , but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with , yet we do n't appreciate it one bit.This movie should be shown obligatory in schools . It is the most wonderful film you will ever see , so go and see it . Who knows , maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this ... 10/10 , but I would easily rate it more if it were possible .	1
"Along with the "" Maratonci trce pocasni krug "" from the same director , one of the masterpieces of ex - Yugoslavia comedies .

This film , for an after school special , is n't that bad , and that 's the problem . Nothing happens . You feel as if you 're still in class . A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players . We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them . They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating . Also there are too many characters and no character development . Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids . This could have had a ' Bad News Bears ' feel ( the original ) since there was a girl on an all boys team , but there was n't any feel to this movie at all . It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it , is not fun to bag on , not fun to watch , and is just kind of ... there . Plain . Boring . Something you 'd watch after school before your pre - evening nap . As dull as the day is long and it 's been a long , long day watching this movie .	0
"In this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies . This is amusing at first , but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances , how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.Characters often interact in a peculiar way , with no tact or manners or respect . I believe this is intentional , not bad acting . After all , who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city 's inhabitants behave like that.I did n't like most of the action scenes , apart the death of the priest : too cheap even for the seventies . The plot is n't too polished . But the great scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol , the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with , the "" furniture "" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film.8 out of 10 ."	1
I knew absolutely nothing about Chocolat before my viewing of it . I did n't know anything about the story , the cast , the director , or anything about the film 's history . All I knew was it was a highly - acclaimed French film . Had I known more , I probably would n't have viewed the picture with an open mind . On paper , the premise does n't sound interesting to me . Had I known what Chocolat was about ahead of time , my interest while watching would have been limited . However , not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it . Throughout , I had no clue has to where the story would go , what the characters would do , and what the end result would be . It was , if nothing else , not a predictable film . Indeed , it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks . Telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers . Since the lead character is seen in present day , the audience knows she will remain alive . By using the flashback technique , director Claire Denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage , giving the viewer the sense that Chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside . A lesser filmmaker would give France a haggard - looking face , one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood . Instead , Denis presents France as a beautiful girl , someone who looks fine on the outside . < br />It could be argued that Chocolat is more about France 's mother since she is given far more screen time , though I believe it is ultimately about France . To me , what Chocolat is really about is how a mother 's actions affect her daughter . It is about how parents ' behavior stays with their offspring . France is not ruined by her mother 's actions in the story , yet her mother 's actions clearly made an impression on France . Had France not been affected at all by her mother 's actions , the flashback aspect would be irrelevant . < br />For a movie that deals with two time periods , the past and the present , Chocolat was a very well paced , there were no scene of excess fat . None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place . The film had nice rhythm , the editing crisp , leaving only what was necessary to tell the story . With a well told story , solid editing , and organized directing , Chocolat is one of the better French films I have seen . It was responsible for launching Claire Denis ' career and with good reason : it 's an incredible directorial debut .	1
"You ca n't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days , and I had expected it to be campy anyway . ( It 's not all that campy in reality . With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter , who do n't take themselves seriously , the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight ; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad . ) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to , which kind of shocked me ; I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra - low - budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story , but they use lots of words like "" technological "" and "" physicality "" in the script to get their point across . ( Although it 's possible that the story is important only to explain why there 's so few cast members . ) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline , and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft - core homoeroticisms ( which are n't all that edgy ) . I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason . The film is grainy , with a TV - quality look and acting level . There are a few "" sexy "" scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers , feeling themselves up ; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny . And I liked the digs at L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones , but it still is n't any good . 3/10"	0
"I 'm easily entertained . I enjoyed "" Hot Shots "" and "" The Naked Gun "" and their many sequels , even when most people found them unbearable .

It 's been a while since I 've seen it , but I do remember sitting in the theater thinking , "" This is a dumb movie . Why did I see this ?

Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just do n't measure up to the rest . This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all . The biggest reason I do n't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense . The acting is very bad even Steven seagal does not do good acting , The rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies . It does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it does n't make much sense . Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it . The special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake . So all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie do n't rent this one just pretend it does not exist . So just avoid this movie.Overall score : * * out of * * * * * * * * * * < br /><br / > * out of * * * * *	0
' Arms and the Man ' is one of Shaw 's funniest plays if handled correctly , and this production does a good enough job . Helena Bonham - Carter , pre - film stardom , is Raina , the daughter of a military family , who has a peacock of a fiancé ( Patrick Ryecart ) , and who shelters a soldier from the enemy ( Pip Torrens ) during a raid on the town.Full of colour and energy , this production rips along at a good pace , and if Bonham - Carter and Patsy Kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast , they still hold their ground . Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as the parents are delightful , and the whole play is generally a happy one.Highly recommended .	1
This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in Cameroun 's judicial system-- policewomen , lawyers and judges . Despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means , the desperate poverty of the people , multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave , strong women are making a difference.This is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind . Despite the atrocities we see in the movie , justice does get served thanks to these passionate , hardworking women.I only hope this film gets a wide release in the United States . The more people who see this film , the better .	1
I thought the kids in the movie were great . I deal with kids in that age group , and I thought their behaviors were very believable . I did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5-year old . I did n't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie . < br />I think Luke Benward is up and coming star . I would like to see more of him on the big screen . I enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in . Often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences . Almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie.I also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group . It is a major problem in schools today.The ending was quite unexpected . Billy 's thoughts on whether he won or did n't win the bet were very surprising . How he handled that situation was excellent . Too often today kids are not willing to compromise . The actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life .	1
"I 'll have to add dissenting comment here . Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao - hsien . i.e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . Unfortunately this is n't quite accurate . The film plays out rather like a film school graduate 's attempt to emulate these masters . All the pieces are there - the beautiful backdrop , the vaguely minimalist dialogue , the slow swaying camerawork , and male leads , in particular , who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . The dialogue is leaden . The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type ; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . Unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical "" Chekovian "" ( i.e. very predictable ) plot , the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . I could n't help but see the "" Blue Danube "" river scene , for example , as verging on genre parody ( although the smoggy looking "" springtime "" sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour ... ) I actually went to this movie on the basis that Mark Li Ping was photographing it . While the setting is elegant , and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of "" Flowers of Shanghai "" , the film is not in the same league , visually . In fact I must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film , I suddenly remembered that I was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave ( and I ca n't recall the last film I walked out of ) . I 'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point I could n't care . If you 'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then I 'd recommend anything by the above two directors , for example "" In the Mood for Love "" or "" Flowers of Shanghai "" , both of which were filmed by the talented Mr Ping ( the former with Chris Doyle ) , and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . It 's not often Mr Hoberman leads me astray , and perhaps you 'd rather listen to him , but do n't say you were n't warned . Craig.<br / >"	0
I had just watched one episode of this program and I could n't even get to the end of the program . Every minute I had watched this program my I.Q must of dropped about 10 points . This is basically like a children 's program but with swearing . Not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh . Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded , disappointing , horribly acted program . Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons .	0
Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960 - 1980 . Always strong at the box - office , and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies , mafia score - settling and World War II battles , Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night . He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day : Gabin , Belmondo , Fernandel , Delon , Sharif , Anthony Quinn . I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand . It 's an oddly static film , taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms , containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.Montand gives a good performance , if somewhat dry , and he is well supported by the other actors . I could n't help wondering what Costa - Gavras could have done with this story , on the basis of Z ( the Lambrakis assassination ) and L'aveu ( the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists ) .	1
"THHE remake was a superior movie remake in every way . Most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub - genre of horror is concerned . In steps part 2 directed by another individual Martin Weisz and written by the father and son combo of Jonathan and Wes "" I can not make a good horror movie to save my life anymore "" Craven and if this is any indication of Weisz directing skills and young Craven 's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as THHE 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on ANY level.We start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come , only hint to what could have been in this film . We then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects . In steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day , this is where the major problems begin.From very sub par acting ( yes even for this kind of movie ) to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time THHE 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves . Think the Marines in Aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained . This is the true shame of the film as most of the Hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see , like in the first film , in fact if this did not have THHE 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a Sci - Fi Channel original.The Mutant Mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting . Also the one that took the cake was the Sloth - like Mutant ( you know Sloth from the Goonies ) who helps them out in the 3rd act . I was waiting for him to ask for a Baby Ruth or start going on about Rocky Road Ice Cream . Truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here.The gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really is n't anything that stood out like in the first . Another major strike against this movie . So what did work here , the answer is nothing at all . This felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually "" good "" film.I can go on about the crappy Drill SGT . , the radio man that has a speech impediment ( that 's right , he is the kind of guy I want radioing in for help in a real crisis ) or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our "" hero "" in the first film but I believe you get the point . This movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first . It should have been given another title and been added to the Saturday Night Line up on The Sci - Fi Channel . A true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as I give THHE 2 the same score as its part : 2/10 Dreadful : Words can not describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way , uninspired and down - right unnecessary . Next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad ... don't even bother . Please do n't go support this garbage at the theaters , save your money and thank me later ! ! ! !"	0
Iberia is nice to see on TV . But why see this in silver screen ? Lot of dance and music . If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie . But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time . If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it 's better to see Bollywood movie . They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie . Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience . And time to time it 's look really good . but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting .

"On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would n't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this is n't about football it is about discrimination and the women 's enthusiasm for the sport they love.The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain , a girl is trying to get in to Tehran 's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy , it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her . Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught , here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who 's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock . We never learn the character 's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary.As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the "" disguise "" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer . The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany . The soldiers are n't shown as fundamentalists , they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman ca n't watch men 's sports do n't seem that convinced by their own arguments.It is a shame that this film ca n't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians are n't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere . The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures ."	1
This one is just like the 6th movie . The movie is really bad . It offers nothing in the death department . The one - liners are bad and are something that should n't be in a NOES movie . Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie . Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while . The characters are extremely underdeveloped . All in all better than the 6th one , but still one the worst movies of the series . My rating 2/10	0
"The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba , this movie gives you lots of him . Chiba makes speeches ; Chiba poses ; Chiba sneers ; Chiba glares at the camera ; Chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys ; Chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful / pensive ; Chiba drives his car ... I enjoy Chiba as an actor and a martial artist ... but even for a Chiba fan , this movie may have a little too much Sonny Chiba . It 's obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him . And no , I would n't put "" Street Fighter "" in the same category , because in "" SF "" he plays a ruthless , amoral anti - hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes . Here , he 's front and center almost all the time , and he tries to be Batman , Captain America and Bruce Lee rolled into one . Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could n't pull this off for the length of an entire feature film , and Sonny just kind of wears out his welcome . At least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while.The movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence ( apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the American version ) and a goofy cheer "" ( "" Viva ! ! Chiba ! ! Viva ! ! Chiba ! ! ) that starts things on the wrong foot . There is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny ( or his usual English stand - in ) apparently could n't be bothered to do the vocals for the American version , so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from "" Street Fighter "" . < br />Even with all those flaws and the overexposure , this could still be a minor classic , but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy . I 'm willing to believe that Karate actually works if someone as amazing as Chiba 's character is supposed to be does it , but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you ca n't really see what 's going on most of the time . It 's not all bad : there are some decent shots and compositions , and there 's at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client 's bedroom in a genuinely inventive way . < br />And as for the actual plot ... forget it . For a "" bodyguard "" , Chiba 's character is something of an idiot . The screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him ( and his "" client "" ) in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them , and after 30 minutes , it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good . ( Also , If his character was really out to destroy the Japanese drug trade , he 'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets ... and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided . ) < br />Still , as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel . It 's still Sonny Chiba , and he 's still fun to watch . I paid a buck to get this off the bargain DVD rack at a local mega mart , and I feel it was worth watching once ."	0

Far by my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did , after Animaniacs . Even if the ratings were low , so what , I still enjoyed it and loved it , was so funny and I adored the cast , wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic , the whole cast were brilliant , especially the legendary Frank Welker.I'd love to see this cartoon again , was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant . Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it , you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental , that was just fantastic , I love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in . I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back , i loved them	1
Updating of the Bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad - to - average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema - going set . ( For the record , this list , all of the films on which appear to be attempting a Castle - esque miracle , includes , Strange Bedfellows , Thunderstruck , Bad Eggs , The Honourable Wally Norman , Horseplay , The Wannabes and The Nugget . The only one to have worked has been Crackerjack.)Here , the performances never mesh , as John Howard does n't even look like he 's in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention , as Franklin plays sleepy , conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants . 20-year - old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on - screen , but this is hardly a reason to watch the film . In fact , the only reasons may well be ( 1 ) Howard 's bizarre  but quite fun  performance , and ( 2 ) the ' suburban nightmare ' theme , which has run through Somersault , Strange Bedfellows , Tom White , Alexandra 's Project , Danny Deckchair , The Rage in Placid Lake , Traveling Light , Teesh & Trude , Swimming Upstream and Lantana , many of which are very good / excellent . Enter at own risk ! May be one for people who titter at the word ' penis ' . 4/10 .	0
"By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung 's ` Encounters of the Spooky Kind ' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo 's iconic ` A Better Tomorrow ' , ` Zu Warriors ' and the classic ` Mr Vampire ' . Jackie Chan was having international success on video , but it was with ` A Chinese Ghost Story ' that HK cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the West for many years.Western filmgoers had never seen anything like it . It was a film that took various ingredients that HK cinema had used for years ( flying swordsman , wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural ) and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look , feel and execution . Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned , this is the original and best.Director Siu - Tung Ching ( still best known as an Action Choreographer on such films as Woo 's ` A Better Tomorrow 2'/'The Killer ' ) has , under the watchful eye of legendary Producer Tsui Hark , created a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror cinema . And with such an expert crew at his disposal ( no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators ) the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable.The editing by the amazingly prolific David Wu ( who wrote / directed ` The Bride With White Hair 2 ' and edited such classic titles as ` A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 ' , ` Hardboiled ' and the cult hit ` The Club ' ) is quite simply a work of genius . His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying , tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created . Fast moving , outlandish but never confusing they are , even today , the pinnacle of their art.The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles . This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting . Where wonderful blue tinged night sequences , shrouded in an ever - present ghostly fog , are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold . It 's a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty . Even the silken robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie , whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen . Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act . The sets are also amazing , giving an other worldly sense to the forests , and the temple and harshness to the scorched , flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale . The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise.Another major factor to the films success is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong . Hong Kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence , but on ` A Chinese Ghost Story ' the music is , quite simply , vital . From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments . Drums , bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect , but it 's in the slower , achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it 's own . Here ; flutes , strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an HK film . Add to this the female vocal , stunningly beautiful song that plays over Tsau - shen 's and Hsiao Tsing 's love making , ( nothing is ever seen , but the effect is wonderful . This is lovingly innocent movie romance ) and you have a shining example of the power a film 's music can have.And we of course have the acting talent . Leslie Cheung ( ` A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 ' and a very popular singer ) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector . His work in the ( thankfully mild ) comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence.Joey Wang ( who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau classic "" God of Gamblers "" ) has never looked more radiant than how she does here . She is the epitome of ethereal beauty . Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning . She shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do , but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths . Veteran actor Wu Ma ( ` Mr . Vampire ' , ` Swordsman ' ) is great fun as the wise , brave , but ever so grumpy , Yen . He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease . And what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable.But what about the monsters and beasties ? , I hear you cry . Well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion / animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple ( resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsau - shen ) , to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective Lord Black . Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads , and quite outstanding wire work . Most of which has , to this day , never been topped.But the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit 's killer tongue . We first encounter this thing with an ` Evil Dead ' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks . But later it 's shown in all its crazy glory . It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey , rips apart trees , wraps itself around buildings and coils it 's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks ! ! It can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth ! It 's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot should n't work . But it does , to fantastic and unforgettable effect.So what all this adds up to is a classic example of Hong Kong movie making . A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie . It 's a film packed with wit , invention , action , monsters , martial arts , ghosts , fantastic ideas , lush visuals , beautiful music , and most important to it 's enduring charm , one of cinemas most moving romances ."	1
"I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one 's heard of and could be a possible gem . I saw this and , since I 'm a fan of violence and gore , I got it . It got the rating of EM which means : Extremely Mature . Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else , I got it . The warning on the box said : Extreme Violence , Extreme Langauge , and Nudity . The "" extreme violence "" struck my fancy . The movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick . It had one or two gory scenes but I 've seen worse in a PG-13 movie . Of course the amount of gore in a movie is n't all that counts , right ? You have plot also . Well , the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it . Do n't rent it . I speak the truth . I ca n't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say : "" I 'm gon na rent that again . "" It had it 's moments where it kept you going but I 'm never going to see that film again ."	0
Dear Readers,The final battle between the Rebellion and Empire . The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance . Luke Skywalker , now a Jedi knight , returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia , now revealed as Luke 's twin sister ! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star . Little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star.Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy . It 's got action , drama , romance , great battles , fantastic Acting , amazing fight scenes , and awesome music by John Williams . Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight , gone is the naive farm - boy and in his place is a calm , relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy . Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando . 3P0 , R2 , and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema 's greatest villain : Darth Vader . Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine . The Action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty . John Williams 's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.Signed , The Constant DVD Collector	1
"I really wanted to like this movie , but it never gave me a chance . It 's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme , but it fails miserably . It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high - school kids for some school project , and that 's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at . There is no subtlety and , more damningly for a mockumentary , it never once feels like a documentary . And while the lines are n't funny in the first place , an attempt at dead - pan delivery would have helped -- certainly , anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.I'd recommend this to people who like "" comedies "" in the vein of "" Big Momma 's House "" or "" Norbit "" ; people who think that words like "" butt "" are inherently hysterically funny . Other people should stay away and not waste their time ."	0
The story and the characters were some of the best I 've ever seen . the graphics were good for the PS and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing . I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it . I felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel . or at least a remake . If they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand ) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy .	1
"Can Scarcely Imagine a Better Movie Than This < br />Hey , before you all go "" Chick Flick "" on me . I am a very Large Strong & Masculine , Macho Man , who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years . < br />The acting was Superb and the Story was Marvelous . This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul . The Acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast . < br />I have known for a Good while that Mercedes Ruehl , along with Holly Hunter , Joan Plowright , Dame Edith Evans , Sissy Spacek , Judi Dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film . And of course Cloris Leachman ( also in this film ) in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years .. At any rate this was an Amazing cast . This film was like a book that you can not lay down , and when you have reached the last page wish for more ... still more . I can not for the life of me understand why this film here on the IMDb only rates a 3.9 < br />That rating here is utterly Amazing to me . Or perhaps not . Perhaps in fact I do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad . It makes me ever so sad that films like "" American Beauty "" "" Leaving Las Vegas "" "" Sexy Beast "" and "" Fight Club "" ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an "" R "" rating ... R that is for "" Rubbish "" . Hey o.k . , I realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences , but it is a sad commentary when this lovely , powerful ... extraordinarily , Directed , Acted , and written film seems to be over looked . < br />It obviously was at the Academy Awards as well .... How Sad . And How predictable . My summation is that if you want to see a powerful , Happy , Sad , beautiful story ? watch ...... preferably own this film ..."	1
"First and foremost , Zorie Barber ( Zeke ) , might be one of the worst actors I have ever seen . As a character that 's supposed to be a hip , Village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious , why is he so hyper , over - dramatic , and plain horrible ? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming ? Did the director ? Do n't the martial arts teach discipline ? Aside from that , this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen - it - already gross - out humor . Hand in toilet ? < i > Trainspotting</i > . Masturbation ? Hmm . < i > Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i > , < i > American Pie</i > , the list goes on .. .Bad dialogue : In one sequence , Eric says "" it 's none of my business < i > but</i > . ... "" and 30 seconds later Mia says "" why is this any of your business ? "" Bad editing : At least five minutes worth of film are wasted on NYC traffic shots . < hr > It 's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight - knit group of friends in any world . I ca n't comment on what makes everyone laugh , but if you enjoy low - brow , basic bathroom humor and insults , by all means , enjoy . If you want something a little smarter but on the same lines , see < i > Boomerang</i > . If you want a solid what - goes - around romantic comedy , go for < i > The Tao Of Steve</i > . But anyone who thinks < i > Whipped</i > is witty and an accurate portrayal dating , well , I can not agree at all ."	0
"Pendragon Pictures ' new film "" H G Wells ' War of the Worlds "" , the first faithful adaptation of the original novel , has been in development for about 5 years . A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year ( March , 2005 ) but this never happened . The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of Spielberg 's version , which hits theatres June 29.I liked this film , with certain reservations.How faithful is the adaptation ? It 's not quite 100 % faithful to Wells ' book , but 90 - 95 % faithful is good enough for me . At least several scenes were totally new , such as Ogilvy the astronomer 's confrontation with a farmer , and the unnamed writer / narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin . But on the whole , this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal.Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget . The majority of it seems to have been shot blue - screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds . This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots , and scenes of crowded city streets . The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game . Numerous scenes in horse - carriages were faked -- I guess they could n't afford to rent a horse . The only scenes shot for "" real "" seem to be those in open fields or forests.But within those budget restrictions , they managed to do quite a lot . Artistically , the film looks right . The Martians and their tripods are quite well done , and very true to Wells ' descriptions . I was particularly impressed with the heat ray . Although the Thunder Child sequence , which should have been one of the film 's highlights , is very disappointing . It 's a great shame that they could n't afford more actual sets , or better quality animation.The acting and direction wo n't win any Oscars . For the most part , they are competent , not bad , but not outstanding . The music is quite good also , though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers.I'm actually glad this did n't get a theatrical release , because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen . As it stands , I would rate this similarly to a BBC - TV adaptation of classic literature.A few nitpicks : Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters ( mostly red ) . This may have been an artistic choice , but it is used very inconsistently , and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD . And the writer / narrator 's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing ? If you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations , and get into the story , I think you will enjoy this , especially if you 've actually read the original H G Wells novel . If , however , you are easily put off by cheap production values , you 'd best pass on this ( unless you 're a MST3 K fan ) . Be warned , however that the film runs a full 3 hours , so I do n't recommend watching it all in one sitting.BTW : An entirely different version of War of the Worlds ( aka "" INVASION "" ) came out on DVD the same month that Spielberg 's hit the theatres : http://imdb.com / title / tt0449040/. This was also made on a budget , but is updated to the present day like the Spielberg film - but it 's much better ! And to top it off , Jeff Wayne is making an animated film of his best - selling album from 1978 , but that wo n't be out until 2007 ."	1
"I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "" spiritual "" New Age types , who , quite unlike me , very much enjoyed this movie --- although according to those that also knew the book ( apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense ) , the movie is not quite as good . So , if you tend to think of yourself as "" spiritual "" , believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like "" aura "" and "" astral body "" , and do n't mind the frequent use of the term "" energy "" outside of the context of physics or technology , you might actually like the movie , and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.However , if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe , if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane New Age nonsense and plots based thereon , if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality , and perhaps even expect reasonable non - wooden dialog an acting , then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie : Stay . Away.Don't even think about it . Tonight , this movie displaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I ever personally saw in a movie theater ( I do not count movies I went to see with the expectation of them being bad , such as Plan 9 etc . ) . At the same time , it raised the grand total of movies I almost walked out on to two ( D&D being the other one ) . I do not walk out on movies , not even on this one , but I should 've when I first saw the visual depiction of an aura , because the New Age BS keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.The plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies , in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution . Or something like that . They actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution , which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe . The movie is shock full with whoppers like that . Occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as "" another dimension "" , or perhaps "" another plane "" , only to become invisible to those around them who have n't yet reached enlightenment . Goodness.At the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the "" insights "" making up the prophecy , painfully slow , presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better , more enlightened individuals.Good things about the movie ? Some very pretty nature shots , and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and de Almeida.I honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable . It really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind , and unless that 's your thing , you better do something else with your time and money ."	0
"An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital . It recalled - Stephen Kings "" Langoliers "" , "" Kingdom Hospital "" and old twilight zone episodes . Atmospherically strong , the set up was great . There were also some very clever ' time loop ' moments which always have that head - melt appeal . The story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul - thing would be explained . And THAT was were Dark Floors severely let me down . Based on my viewing the movie gives NO EXPLANATION as to what is behind the events . Whilst , some ambiguity is always expected / welcome in these kind of films . Dark floors took it to new heights of vagueness . I do n't expect things wrapped up in a pretty ribbon , but neither should I be left feeling "" Huh ? .. is that it ? ... Did I dose off ? Maybe , I hit chapter skip by mistake ? "" Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that "" It was all a dream "" which is a shame because up until the last reel I was very much on board and enjoying the movie ."	0
"The main reason people still care about "" Carlton - Browne Of The F.O. "" is that it features Peter Sellers in a second - billed role . But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake.Sellers plays Amphibulos , a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt - poor island nation of Gaillardia , formerly a British colony , now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War . Amphibulos wants to play both U.K. and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit , "" everything very friendly and all our cards under the table "" . Terry - Thomas is the title character , a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Great Britain has n't forgotten them , all appearances to the contrary.A positive review here says : "" The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . "" I would argue that the reason "" Carlton - Browne "" is considered below average is because the comedy is non - existent.After a decent opening that establishes the film 's only two strengths , a sympathetically doltish Terry - Thomas and John Addison 's full - on larky score , things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes . The low opinion of Carlton - Browne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia ( which no one can find on a map ) is milked to death . By the time we actually reach the island ( after a labored series of airsick jokes ) , expectations are quite low.They're still too high , though . The island itself , which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean , is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport , and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade . The army is apparently still horse drawn , allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick - accented announcer : "" In war , the army uses many horse . ""Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we 're on his character 's island . The plot is taken over instead by Ian Bannen as King Loris , who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his father 's assassination . Bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written . Normally this would make him the likely target for scene - stealing by Sellers , but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache , Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year , "" The Mouse That Roared "" and "" I 'm All Right , Jack . ""Strange that this film , like "" Jack "" , was a Boulting Brothers production , with Roy Boulting here serving as co - director alongside Jeffrey Dell . Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything - goes comedy , but here there are only fey jabs in either direction . Amphibulos works his mangled - English vibe for all its worth ( "" This man is like , how do you say , the bull in the Chinese ship "" ) while Carlton - Browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve.The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young Loris 's romance with Ilyena . Score one point for her being played by ravishing Luciana Paluzzi , dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed.The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and a final bit of action by Carlton - Browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally . Apparently he lives to see another day , but the film of the same name is strictly DOA ."	0
It is first and foremost a chick flick , it is a romantic comedy . There is a fair balance between the two . This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes , I do n't think any wires were used or if they were they were n't flat out blatant . It is n't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain , no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning , pretty simple , good chemistry between the leads , and a fun watch . I 'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute , but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty . I 'd watch it again ... with a girl .	1
This is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good ! Even though some of the actors and actresses were n't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old ! It was funny , gross and just all out a very good movie . In most parts I just did n't know what was going to happen next ! I was like I think this is going to happen , wait I think this is going to happen . All age groups will love this movie ! In some parts I could n't stop laughing , it was so funny , but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I could n't believe what I was seeing ! I am definitely going to see this movie again ! It is one of those movies where it ca n't get boring . Every time you see it is so suspenseful . I definitely recommend seeing this movie ! !	1
"Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple , successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world . So , what happens when you 've been everywhere and done everything with the formula ? You switch it up right ? Wrong . You stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again , keeping the core of its success intact . That is to say , stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it . This to me is why "" What 's New Scooby Doo "" worked , they want back to the classic Scooby Doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in "" A Pup Named Scooby Doo "" but for the most part had not been tapped since the original "" Scooby Doo Where Are You"".The first sign ( to me ) of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters ; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think "" Scooby Doo "" you are n't thinking of Film - Flam , Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum . Even worse , the exclusion of the other core members of "" Mystery Inc "" generally indicate a group of production people who do n't understand from a kids point of view how the show works . The basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual , stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand.This next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want : I hope that I can explain why I think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole ; Fred represents the Driver , I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction , organization and sub - tasks . Fred is n't a happy - go - lucky teenager , he 's your boss , your teacher , your dad , your authority figure . Fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks ( problem always equals solution for Fred ) . In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy . Shaggy is your best friend , that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are , he enables you to be brave , to not be at the back of the pack . Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear . Velma represents rational thought , she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show . Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery ? The group often finds itself in situations where truths are n't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task , chance is represented by Daphne . At one point ( I think it is the first Scooby Doo series ) she was known as "" danger prone "" . Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident . She frequently is the one who finds the secret door , collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together . Finally Scooby himself represents us , the participant . He is always in the centre of events , capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of , yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate . Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining.Maybe I 'm over thinking things but , in my life I 've seen a lot of Scooby Doo ( being a 30 year old self - proclaimed nerd , it kind of rolls with the territory ) . To me there is a magic with the classic "" Scooby Doo "" formula that should never be messed with.As many have pointed out ; Scooby Doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite , it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal . Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else , something lesser ."	0
"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James . He brought us wonderfully , thrilling science - fiction such as Terminator and Aliens . These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry . Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era. ....... and then it happened ................... 1997 ........ countless awards .......... obscene amounts of money ............ outlandish barrage of advertising ............ maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here!I have never ( ever ) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it , in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going . Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210 , the acting was more wooden than my nephew 's tree house , images meant to terrify were actually comical ( man falling from ship and hitting propeller ) , historically false ( do n't even get me started because there 's too much ) , it had dire theme music ( up there with the bodyguard for cheese ) and the pointless love story was so tedious , self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved ( I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching , bubblegum chewing , boy - with - car chasing , teenage girls ( DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band ) who would drag their sex - starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick - flick hoping to get lucky later ! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point . Millions of dumbed down , culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because "" it cost so much to produce it must be great "" and "" Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies "" . < br />The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards . King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based . It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people . < br />However , if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off . Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money , I 'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly , historically false / human interest tripe like "" The Patriot "" and "" Pearl Harbor "" ."	0
"BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen . It is an off - the - wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker . They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation . Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to "" psyche - out "" other members of the opposing team . There is no rule about what is not allowed , so naturally they do the craziest things possible . One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast , and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "" Wow this this over already ? "" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak , who is a hyped - up little guy . BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines , and it is very fun to watch !"	1
"This early sci - fi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of film - making . Adapted from Wells ' somewhat different work by the author , it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of ' peace ' . The structure is that after a contrasted - pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war , the script allows the war to happen . Two families , the Cabells and the Passworthys disagree about what may happen ; Passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization 's "" automatic "" progress ; Cabell is the thinker , the doubter . Their city Everytown -- obviously London-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks , a magnificent war march by Bliss , and the end of civilization . The second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a "" Boss "" , played with bravura by Ralph Richardson , whose woman , lovely Margaretta Scott , is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete - bound dictator type . He is trying to rebuild old WWI airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom ; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes -- etc.--everlastingly ; this is Wells ' comment on war versus progress . The survivors are subject to a plague called "" The Wandering Sickness "" also . Enter a modern flying machine piloted by the Cabell of the first section of the film , now part of Wings Over the World , an International Scientists ' Coalition , who are planning to end warfare forever . This flight - suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the Boss and his woman , their attraction being evident ; then Boss sends up his aircraft against them , the Scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the "" Gas of Peace "" onto the ruins of Everytown . Only the Boss dies , fighting too hard against the pacifying . The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers . In section three , a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science . Passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the Moon ; Cabell champions man 's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons . The son of Passworthy and Cabell 's daughter , are the astronauts being sent . Theotocopulos , a religious - minded Luddite , makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city 's Forum and leads an attack on the ' space gun ' that is to fire the new rocket free of Earth 's gravity . The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully ; the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned . "" It is all the universe -- or nothing ! "" Cabell tells Passworthy . "" Which shall it be ? "" As Cabell , Raymond Massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance ; he is thoughtful , compassionate , and reasonable , a true scientist . As the rabble - rouser who wants to end the Age of Science , Cedric Hardwicke is perfect and powerful . Edward Chapman playing Passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear . The storyline is logical , frequently beautiful and always interesting . Given the near - extinction of mankind , the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer . This is a triumph for the director , William Cameron Menzies , for Bliss and for all concerned . Listen to the dialogue with someone you love ; within its constructed limits , this is a thinking man 's drama debating two possible human futures -- progress or its reactionary opposite ."	1
"I give this movie an A+ for the sheer camp of it ! As Dietrich 's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book on her mother , "" If one sees The Garden of Allah in the context of high camp , it can be very amusing . "" And how ! I laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly , ridiculously , fantastically melodramatic dialogue . Viewers who 've read the accounts of Boyer 's toupee ( it kept coming unstuck in the heat ) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance , presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light ( if you 're starring in a turkey might as well look good ! ) . Dietrich 's costumes are out of this world . As Riva notes in her book , Dietrich managed to steal Paramount 's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns , such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor . It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.In short , if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness , you ca n't help but enjoy it ."	1
"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare . And I have to say , it did not deserve it.Parinda was so hyped , that I was really looking forward to watch it.Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film - makers , despite having a great story . It was even more pathetic to know , that the story itself was not original , it was loosely based on the classic "" On the Waterfront"".Anil Kapoor was irritating , especially when he comes from America . The direction lacked quality many a times , except a few in - between scenes.Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma , Deepa Mehta , Mahesh Bhatt , Sudhir Mishra , and I 'm 100 % sure , they 'll make a mind - blowing movie out of it.I'm not saying Parinda was bad . It was just not good enough ."	0
"I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson . His music , his dancing .. He was and is the greatest of all times . Few days ago a friend gave me a present .. "" Moonwalker "" DVD .. I just could n't believe it ! So I took my time and saw the movie again .. After a lot of years , and it kicked me back in time . I almost cried . Not because of Michael Jackson but of the good old times I remembered back than when I went to his concerts , enjoying music and dancing . The movie gave me some other perspective than back then when i was a kid . You can truly see the parody that Michael went through his life . Thank You Michael Jackson to bring me back to those great times , to Your great music and dancing . It 's a shame that people has forgotten You .. I did n't because You gave me great moments with your music .. All the best to You where ever You are out there .."	1
"I 'm disappointed that Reiser ( who wrote the film ) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever . Maybe that 's his idea of "" adult "" films , plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in ? I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie.Falk 's acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating.This might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles . But the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails . Certainly not worth spending money on , though it might be worth a watch for free on television ."	1
A young couple Mandy Pullman ( Mitch Martin ) and Roy Seeley ( Matt Birman ) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen . They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other . Mandy hides in an old run down cabin , she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant . Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed . Dr. Sam Cordell ( John Cassavetes ) and his daughter Jenny ( Erin Flannery ) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam 's wife . Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden ( John Ireland ) when Mandy and Roy are found . He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries . Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis ( Denise Furgusson ) is also attacked and raped . A local journalist named Laura Kincaid ( Kerrie Keane ) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier . More rapes and murders occur . Meanwhile Jenny 's boyfriend Tim Galen ( Duncan MacIntosh ) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts . Tim 's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape - shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce ! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film . The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least . Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I 've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly . As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes , but none are shown on screen . There is only one gore scene in the entire film too . The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes . Everything about this film production - wise is very static and flat , the film has no energy or pace . The acting is dull and you do n't feel or care for anyone . Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions . The type of rubbish horror film making that you 'll forget within a day . A real waste of time , do n't bother .	0
"No doubt , when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married , it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers . If you 've been through the ordeal of watching "" Swept Away , "" then you know at that level it was a match made in hell . After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress ( or "" octress "" as she might have pronounced it in "" The Next Best Thing "" ) , she still ca n't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent . And that 's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen : that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience . If there 's any justice in this universe , she just blew her last chance ."	0
Six degrees had me hooked . I looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced it 's time spot . I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007 . What happened ? All my friends were really surprised it ended . We could relate to the characters who had real problems . We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters . There was n't anybody on the show I did n't like and felt the acting was superb . I alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas . I for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance . Give it a good time slot , do n't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on .	1
"I must have been only 11 when Mr Peepers started . It was a must see for the whole family , I believe on Sun . nights . Repeating gags were Rob opening his locker ( he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things , finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open ) , and taking pins out of a new shirt(at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt , timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs . ) I remember an aunt that drove a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "" Sonny "" to Say something scientific . He would think and come up with "" semi permeable membrane "" or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was . ( you had to have been there ) . Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on screen . Why they did n't continue the series from her POV when Wally quit ( he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late)I'll never know . I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding ( big one anyway ) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show . Horsecocky . It was Rob and Nancy ( did I ever have the hots for her ) and I remember it made the cover of TV Guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines . A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now . I still remember it as wonderful and wish I had been a little older ."	1
hello boys and girls ... this is n't your regular movie review , because this is going to be the cold . hard . truth . are you serious ? this movie sucked so many balls i could n't keep them out of my mouth ! they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen . you 'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie.the plot was very lacking . the actors were terrible . i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit . do boys , everyone!peace R&H besties4lyf	0
"It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest , if any , without his presence.Despite a not outstanding direction - in fact , there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly - , a seemingly low budget , a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points , the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end.I have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance , even Paul Scofield acting in "" A man for all seasons"".Actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to Church by performing a crime.""Je suis Maurice Morand , prètre catholique "" ( "" I am Maurice Morand , a catholic priest"")is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end.The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich Morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into Christ´s blood.Gérard - the man that wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret . He does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine.In next scene , the dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable . "" Do you carry away men too ? "" asks Morand , who hates himself for what he has just done . "" That would be too much work "" is the smart answer.The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time.I think that "" Le défroqué "" is a very strange film , but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history.<br / >"	1
"I do n't know where to begin . This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties . Sort of like Captain Power or the Power Rangers . It 's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding "" secret agencies "" and villains.The acting is so bad that it 's not even funny . The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity . It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on , when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car . For some reason , even though the device is clearly stated as being "" remote detonated "" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away . This chase carries on . all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts . Standing up on the bikes , doing wheelies and so on . At one point , a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike , we see the bike ( clearly cgi ) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished . Then , a few seconds later the rider and bike return ... apparently unscathed by the crash . At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it , the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past , then blow up her car . Which was also clearly done with cgi . Sound confusing ? It is , and so is the rest of the movie.I might point out that when I say cgi , we are n't talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here . We 're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type cgi , actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers.Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know , I can only assume they did for money , as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it ... probably the last one ."	0
"I first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny , similar to CB4 . I was blown away . I was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great . Way better than CB4 , the characters , the songs , the plot , everything . Top notch independent film that was given "" Two Thumbs UP "" by Siskel and Egbert ( and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick , you know it 's good ) ."	1
Do n't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it 's ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry ( which , morally , is no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis cull ) , it stinks cos it 's pretentious tosh , the sort of up - its - own - behind guff that gets modern art a bad name . That said , there are some stunning images , but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination , so that 's no reason to go and see this nonsense . What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted , and then , just when you thinks it 's finished , it starts again . I saw it it in a porn cinema in Rome which had been hired for the weekend to show Barney 's film works , which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty - old - men - in - macs brigade , but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard - stroking Bjork fans were to be honest , everyone might have had a lot more fun if they 'd just shown one of the pornoes !	0
"Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . The plot is pretty much foreseeable , the characters are stereotypes , the editing too exaggerated . Anyway , the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions . < br />Instead , I think this is a straight commercial thing . Including a character from the french part of Switzerland ( the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band 's called SENS UNIK ) seems to aim to a larger audience . A straight German - swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa . What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie . Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips ! < br />I also think the topic of "" young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives "" is a wide spread reality in Zurich . Therefore , it should be elaborated with more care . I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White , in order that his next movie is gon na show his true artistic skills ."	0
"PRC which was the lowest of the low actually struck gold with this moody little thriller . They did the same thing a year earlier with "" Detour "" which is probably one of the finest low - budget films ever made.""Strangler "" is basically a one set film , filled with mist and shadows , a technique used by most poverty row studios to hide the sets , or lack thereof . But here , it works well . The ghost of Charles Middleton ( better known as Ming the Merciless ) lurches around the swamp killing those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generates some sympathy from the viewer . His final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman ..... he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well.Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style . She offers herself up to the strangler in order to put a stop to the killing but as a sop to the audience , the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter , somewhat chastened . If Ulmer(who directed "" Detour "" ) has directed "" Strangler "" she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the strangler 's job would be done . But who 's complaining ? It 's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets , lighting and the general moodiness of the piece . It stands , right behind "" Detour "" , as PRC 's finest hour"	1
A famous orchestra conductor , Daniel Dareus , suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert . Suddenly , we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before . Since he left so young , and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona . He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay . The building needs a lot of work . One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode , but no , Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way.The local pastor , Stig , whose church has a small choir , comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping , but the conductor has no desire to go back to music . Daniel begins to explore his new universe . The town 's people leave him alone . He makes an impression on Lena , who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies . Little by little , he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir . Lena will ultimately fall in love with Daniel.At first , the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected . As they get to know him better , they come around to accept him and make him one of them . His new position does n't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge . The members of the choir are a motley crew , but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs . The new piece composed for Gabriella , a battered wife , makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers.Daniel 's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig 's own . The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light ; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife , Siv . His ideas clash with the dogma , as Siv points to him . Stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing him as the head of the choir.The choir , which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria . Daniel , who by now has fallen totally for Lena , has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship . Daniel who is late for his own concert , gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them.Kay Pollak , the director of this enormously appealing film , shows he was the man to direct it . The story involves the viewer from the start . Great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together . William Nykvist , who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film . Frida Hallgren , Niklas Falk , Ylva Loof , do excellent work for Mr. Pollak.Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears . Harald Gunnar Paalgard 's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty .	1
"I do miss the company Vestron , they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s . This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse , a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it.The idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings ( thusly the dream world manipulating reality ) , and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she 's never actually met , is fascinating and never disappoints . Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child , it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing . She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end , even finding she does n't "" hate boys "" as she so defiantly claimed at first . Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones , all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer . I 'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor . At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. ( only in Europe ) , here 's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome!It 's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc ( Elliot Spiers ) . Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout , I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being "" hammy acting "" quite perplexing -- I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating . Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door , it 's quite powerful.You do n't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse , just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more . There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I 'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets . For me , it 's never like watching the same film twice , as there are so many details to absorb and savor . A very emotional experience indeed.While there are many films I adore , there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me : films like Paperhouse , Static , Resurrection , and Donnie Darko . When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins , all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed ."	1
where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd ? James Cahill , god rest his soul , made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since Encino Man . his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop McClure , which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor ! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking , and discovers a gang war to rival that of Police Academy 1 , and i mean the one where Jones is racially vilified by his new partner , but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will EVER HEAR.Cahill 's grasp of effects , both visual and aural is electrifying , the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd , a real gritty like underground thriller . also , kudos to his brilliant use of makeup , such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue ! YUCK ! i feel the world of film is much less from James ' passing , his memory will linger on and on and on , reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production , Snitch'd . his insightful director 's commentary released a coke - hit up the nose of any discerning film goer , truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets , captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.but i ask you , why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap ? i 'll tell you why , because that s life in Santa Ana baby , its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle 's offices , oh no . there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft , tattooed underbelly of street life in LA to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a School For Special Children 's production of Double Dragon : The Play.the only qualm i have with this film , is that there was never a sequel made . come on Steven Spielberg , come on George Lucas , come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23 , how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man , James Cahill.he discovered Eva Longoria you know . oh yeah , that he did.Jonah	1
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much . The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Japan , while at the same time exposed to very current themes . The characters are realistic and detailed ; it has an unpredictable ending and story , which is very refreshing . The story is made up of mini - plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan.<br / >	1
I 'll keep this fast and sweet . Five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a ' short cut ' that leads them down a deserted forest - ridden road . Of course nothing but good things happen to them , and they safely arrive at their destination.Alright , they do n't . Soon they 're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues , and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom.I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again . Their screaming , screeching voices gave me a headache , and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming . All in all , one of the worst cheap horror flicks I 've ever seen ... and I 've seen a lot .	0
"Long before "" Brokeback Mountain "" ( about 23 years before ) , "" Deathtrap "" was the first time I ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen , and frankly , I was shocked . I understood it in terms of the plot , and it did n't really upset my sensibilities ( not much ) , but it was the first time I ever saw it , at least , in a "" mainstream "" movie . I thought it was a gutsy move for its time , and took courage for them to try it , especially Christopher Reeve , in the midst of his time as PG - rated Superman . Male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with "" Brokeback , "" but it 's interesting to note this much - earlier incarnation ."	1
""" The Luzhin Defence "" is , in the foreground , a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant ( Turturro ) who becomes consumed by the game and , in the background via flashbacks , his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become . Factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest ( Watson ) and former "" mentor "" ( Wilson ) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of Italy 's Lake Como and the intensity of high chess play . An excellent film for those into period dramas , the auteur 's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film ."	1
"I really enjoyed this episode , which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired . From a pure writing perspective , ' The 16 mm shrine ' is an absolute treat , with fantastic dialogue and character analysis , typical of Sterling . In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode , tackling themes of existence and reality , whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial , pride , and desire . ' The sixteen - millimeter shrine ' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever - changing world . It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone ; one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it . These elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes.The episode is not without its faults however , which mainly lay in Lupino and Leisen shoes . Ironically , I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout , with only a few scenes that could count as memorable . This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character . Furthermore Leisen did n't seem to know what to do with most of his characters , sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing -which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from Lupino half the time- . Thankfully Balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots , helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least.As I said previously however , if you 're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction , this should n't be as bad as it 's sometimes made out to be . In addition to the writing that I mentioned above , the episode also features some fantastic photography ( it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later ! ) and decent enough set - design . Overall ' The sixteen - millimeter shrine "" is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think ."	1

I grew up watching this movie , and I still love it just as much today as when i was a kid . Do n't listen to the critic reviews . They are not accurate on this film . Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll . You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it . I recommend this movie to everybody to see . It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy . With demons , dragons , and a little bald kid with God like powers . This movie takes you from L.A. to Tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in Tibet . Just a beautiful view ! So go do your self a favor and snatch this one up ! You wo nt regret it !	1
I am obsessed ! The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive , but I love it . I am on Season 2 , disc 5 , and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now . For anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show . And , Michael is on my list now . Kidding ... I am so happy to see there is a Season 3 , because I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending . I ca n't wait to see the rest now . Thanks to the directors / producers / and actors of Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again . Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television , but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment !	1
Why did n't the producers give that show a chance Of all the junk on TV , why did n't the producers give Six Degrees a chance ? Will the series go on video ? I would love to see how it ends . Put season one on video and sell it . I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for it 's return . I set my recorder to tape all of the shows . Thank God for that . I just found out that the show was canceled and I 'm heart broken . I wish I knew it was going to be canceled , why did n't they tell us ? I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters . The writing was pretty good also . Steven ( Campbell Scott ) is my all time favorite . I am SO sorry to see it go !	1
"I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History ... the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular . I purchased it recently from a rack of previously - viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and I was very glad to add this one to my history video collection . Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as "" Glory "" or "" Gettysburg , "" provides a lot of history on the pre - Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point.Maybe it 's the gray uniforms , the youth , or the military discipline , but I am fascinated by the story of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the War . I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men , learning how to make war , then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!Actually , there were two classes graduated in 1861 : one class in May , the other in June . the movie makes no real mention of this , except to mention Henry A. DuPont , first graduate of the May Class ; and George Custer , last grad of the June Class . the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war , but it was the result of switching back to a four - year course of study , after a few years of experimenting with a five - year course ( I think the first class had attended five years , the other for four ) . As the movie portrays , cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... George "" Fanny "" or "" Autie "" Custer ; Alonzo "" Lon "" Cushing ; James "" Beauty "" Stuart ( for J.E.B. Stuart , class of 1854 ) , etc.I say this film is "" Santa Fe Trail "" as it should have been because that 1940 film , while enjoyable , really fudges history . Cadets from several different classes are all graduating together . JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side - by - side in stopping John Brown 's 1859 insurrection at Harper 's Ferry . In fact , Stuart and Custer were never friends , but enemies during the War . They faced each other ( for the first time , I think ) at Gettysburg in 1863 ( Stuart was at the Harper 's ferry Raid , but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place).""Fanny "" Custer plays a role in "" Class of ' 61 , "" though his classmate chums , Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional . I believe they are respectively based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham , two people you can look up.Anyway , I truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th Century America ."	1
"This film was so predictable , that during the entire time you 're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent , and there 's some other big twist still coming . However ... it does n't . He just continues to act creepy , and she continues to ignore it . Mary found very incriminating evidence at his place , and she still trusted him ? And what was that "" baiting the trap "" ? There was no trap . She confronted him , he said "" excuse me . I have to go kill someone "" He left , and that was the end of it . They make attempts to use other suspects , ( like that one older carnival girl at the end ) but they 're completely underdeveloped . Actually , all the characters are underdeveloped . They have no depth , and the setting is just plain strange ... who hangs out in a recycling factory ? ? Its choppy and nothing is well developed . For example : When she leaves his place after having the beer , and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car ... what was that ? Her reactions were n't portrayed . In the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape- but then all we see is her showering the next morning . booooooooo It could have been so much better .. sooo much better ."	0
"Seeing as the vote average was pretty low , and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was "" just OK "" , I did n't have much expectations when renting this film.But contrary to the above , I enjoyed it a lot . This is a charming movie . It did n't need to grow on me , I enjoyed it from the beginning . Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character , I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.There 's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that , but there are some rather hilarious scenes , and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film.Very recommended ."	1
A truly adorable heroine who , at turns , is surprised and terrified by giblets , wrestles with mattresses , runs full - on into closed doors ... just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of ' The Naked Truth ' . I LOVED what I caught of this show : enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as , ' Nora Wilde ' ; cute , clownish , and wonderfully accident - prone - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it 's no wonder Hollyood does n't seem to know how to cast her . But where - oh - WHERE are the DVD releases ? The amount of ( bleep ) they release , it 's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried . ( Someone please correct me if I 'm wrong . )	1
"The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea , and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest . But , throughout watching this film , we were saying aloud , "" These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations , the lighting is good , makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad ? "" Throughout the film the sound was echoy , garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.There is some good acting in this film , and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor . This story , with some of the same actors , would have been worth doing as a high - budget film.I just ca n't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget , dedicate more to good sound . Sound is as much a part of a film as the image , and it 's worth doing right . Could 've earned a 6 ."	0
"Mercifully , there 's no video of this wannabe western that a stay - afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering . The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back - room writer . All in all , this show stinks . The story is basically boring , ill - conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it "" ... underrated ... "" The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . You 'll have to catch it on the last show , if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . But , if you can sit through it , you 've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends ."	0
The motion picture was , in all likelihood , made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 . I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era . Nevertheless , this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak . Also , Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act . The result is something that would not be acceptable by today 's standards . For 1931 , maybe . For 2004 , not acceptable . Some of the actors performed well . Sadly , the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns . They were living on the land long before the white man came , but according to twisted history , they had no right to defend themselves .	0
"... for one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me for being dull.First of all i have n't seen the first one ( i was bored that 's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one ) , well i hope the first one is better than this , it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes , For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high ( belive me so do i ) , but it made me laugh a few times , because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea , what 's next "" Det sjunde inseglet II "" . Sequels not based on novel or book does n't turning out great to often , and this is a perfect example of one.OK i 'm gon na be honest with you : i did laugh a bit , it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor . But do n't buy it , rent it . Just let some other idiot do it or download it.4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already ..."	0
I was looking forward to this ride , and was horribly disappointed.And I am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides.The roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride . < br />It was visually dull and poorly executed . < br />It was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland , and failed in every aspect.It was not thrilling or exciting in the least .	0
This movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power , sentimentality and love triangle of emotions . What really bothered me about this movie was the makers ' absurd notion of surrogate mother . A whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man ( of the family desiring a child ) is not a surrogate mother . Neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother . I have seen Indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently . The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible . I realize that most bollywood movies are n't meant to be plausible , but they do n't pretend to be either . This movie wants us to emote along with the characters , but this ca n't done with such a ridiculous , contrived conflict . I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan .	0
I 've read most of the comments here . I came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history . There are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and < br />I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary . About two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about Tony . But I do n't think narration is unnecessary . Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations . We are living and making our own autobiography . So if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration . We do n't sum up facts like : Birth , Childhood , High School etc . We create a story about our live.Because we are familiar with stories , we want to put history in a story as well . Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves . We can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story . So that 's the purpose of adding a story in documentary . The story is weak , so be it , but we understand what s going on . If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brother.And the second point , making a blockbuster movie about it . True , it 's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9/11 . Though , there have been a few about the subject , but none of them like this documentary . But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years ? I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9/11 . But I also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history . How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen ? If I had not seen these movies my view of the WW would me totally different . I remember seeing Schindlers List , and I cried for an hour during class . Movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties . < br />So my point : telling stories is not always bad , it makes us identify with the story , and makes us never forget what happened .	1
Teamo Supremo are three kids , consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall , Rope Girl and Skate Lad , all with their own battlecry ( buza ! chika ! woopa ! ) and outfit and moves . They work for the governor , Kevin , and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game . They lead normal lives as well , and have family and school duties , but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains . The villains all have rather unique and singular traits , such as Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway . From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil , and often strange , plans to gain power , take revenge etc.The animation itself is quite nice and smooth , but the style appears to be simple on purpose . The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic . The music is quite nice , and the show is n't too bad altogether , although the style is n't my favourite.The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous , but after all this is a cartoon and one ca n't blame them for that . However this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore ! or Pepper Ann .	0
I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film , which was shot on location in Alaska . Although technically a melodrama , we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in , such as hunting , dancing , building igloos , etc . And their customs , such as offering their wives to visitors , are routinely in the story . The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage , as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals , but even these were fascinating . Spear fishing for salmon , hunting for walrus , caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times . There was no cast listing , which reinforced the documentary flavor . The film - makers tried to make it seem very authentic , with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles . The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police , there were no actors in the film , but this was not strictly true . The two leading characters , played by Mala and Lotus Long , were Eskimos by birth , but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on . But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers . All in all , the film is definitely worth a look .	1
Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed , Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good . Bleed is pretty bad . The best part is seeing the female cast nude . The gore is very fake looking and over - done . It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I did n't want to stay to see the horrible ending . If I could , I would ban these actors and actresses , the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon ( Maddy ) has been in over a hundred other videos and I 've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures . They should not allowed to continue this madness .	0
This movie has it all . It is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees . Antonio Montana(played by Al Pacino ) , is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America . This cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of Miamis ' Drug Empire is astonishing . Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture , so much that , the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline , as well as every character in the cast . With Tony 's characters ' pressence being so believable and strong , Brian DePalma brang out the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer(Manny , Tony 's best Friend ) , Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio(Gina , Tony 's Sister ) , Robert Loggia(Frank , Tony 's Boss)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elvira , Frank 's Wife ) . I enjoyed every minute watching this movie , and still watch it on a weekly basis . On this year , the 20th Anniversary of this classic crime movie , I for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers . With other crime movies being so dramatic I find , this movie is a shock to the system .	1
I was one of the few non - liberals who showed up to see Steve 's video . It was quite an experience ... in propaganda film - making and boredom.I was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of Michael Moore 's visit to my local school , UVSC , but it turned out to be another liberal , slash - and - burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community . It sure seems self - serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues.What 's more surprising is to see all the ' 10 ' votes his homeys have posted here . Did they even see the video ? Golly gee Batman , this must rank with All The President 's Men ! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film . < br />Yeah , like stacking the votes at IMDb will help a lame movie . Maybe my vote will help balance this out .	0
"First time I saw this movie was in the eighties , but reviewed now this thriller is still actual . Some newer movies focus on similar topics , but they do not match this french milestone.A president - obviously JF Kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance . The resulting huge investigation finds the "" Lee Harvey Oswald "" figure of this movie guilty , but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry . He reveals some surprising evidence ... < br />Unlike Oliver Stone 's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions , but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together , drawing a new picture of the assassination . Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene . Compared to JFK this movie is more reasonable , intelligent and thrilling . Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies , I had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema.""I ... comme Icare "" is a "" must see "" . Its unique and brilliant , and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful . This movie deserves a very good ranking , if it was a Hollywood production it would be famous for sure.<br / >"	1
It is such a strange movie , you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh - athon . Strange comes to mind again and again . Shot amateurishly , acted even worse and the directions , maybe none . The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit . See it if you got time to kill . But do n't , do n't even try to take it seriously . Supposed to be a tribute to ' Porno holocaust ' , . Since I have n't seen it , from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad . Should have given it 1/10 , but it did give me a good laugh or two , so it gets a 3 . Excessive gore , the only thing somebody worked on . Stay away if you are squeamish , more gore than laughs . Wonder if the makers had a laugh making it ?	0
There 's not much to say about this one . Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle . He is loosed by a nuclear explosion . He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk ( oh yeah , power lines . I almost forgot ) . At one time , early in the film , he befriends a little boy , and instead of just throwing him away , or squashing him , he places him down on the ground . Safe . From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away , show up and run away , show up and run away . For some reason , Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away . Oh , well , the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space . As usual , the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated ( a guy in a Gammera suit ) . The Japanese army ( with the help of Americans ) , uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt , and , of course , it does no good . They should know this anyway . We 've seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo . Not to put these down because they can be fun , but it 's really not very good .	0
If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it 's this pile of crap . I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity . I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it 's so insultingly poor , I ca n't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.There 's no plot and the non - plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking . The people do n't react , act or in any way resemble human beings . The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be . The whole thing is one pointless mess , it does n't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and do n't do very much.I could make a better film than this , so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before . It 's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.Honestly , the very worst movie of all time . You 'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD . I ca n't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film , it 's terrible.0/10 and that 's generous .	0
Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves . Among the more prominent we have , ` Officer and a Gentleman ' , ` Top Gun ' , ` GI Jane ' , and now ` Men of Honor ' . The fact that this one happened to be true does n't change the fact that the formula is the same . This film is probably most like ` GI Jane ' since it focuses on the desegregation angle.The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human - interest story among those mentioned above . Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle , and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film . Unfortunately , director George Tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity . Billy Sunday ( Robert De Niro ) is a central figure , and except for the initial scene , the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife , we do n't know much about him . For instance , Brashear sees the scars on Sunday 's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow , but there is no follow - up on that point . Mr. Pappy ( Hal Holbrook ) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him . The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting . If a director is going to make a human - interest story , he needs to humanize the characters.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear . This is probably the best I 've seen him . This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before , and he rises to the occasion . In ` Jerry Maguire ' , Rod Tidwell was a fascinating , but one - dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle . Brashear is much more complex and grounded , and the issues he faces are life crises , making the part far more challenging . This is an excellent recovery from Gooding 's last role in ` Chill Factor ' , a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.After a stint trying his hand as a comedian ( ` Analyze This ' , ` The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle ' , ` Meet The Parents ' ) , Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance . DeNiro is n't a bad comedian , he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he should n't waste his time doing comedy . DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul . It is a pleasure watching him work . < br />It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it . I saw ` The Legend of Bagger Vance ' , ` Men of Honor ' and ` The Yards ' right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 ( actually , she only did five ) . This was a minor role for Theron , but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step . David Keith , who co - starred with Richard Gere in ` Officer and a Gentleman ' , has a cameo here < br />The DVD has some interesting special features , including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one - dimensional presentation . I rated it a 7/10 . I 'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme . This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director 's shortcomings .	1
"In 1988 , Paperhouse was hailed as a "" thinking man 's horror film . "" Wow , you might say , sign me up . This thing is a mess . It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2 . G. Headley with a bad British ( dubbed ) accent , and a story with no chills , thrills or spills.It is n't even interesting psycho - babble . One will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of Leprechaun 5.The story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams . WHat you get is n't good horror , art house or even a decent after - school special . I found myself after the two hour point saying .. where did my two hours go.The direction is uninspired and I wished it could even be pretentious ... something interesting .. it seems like the producers were on lithium.Even in the dream world things are boring.A short no on this one ."	0
"Actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful , funny , rough - hewn book about her career as an actress , her crazy - quilt love - life , and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good . With this rich material to draw from ( and Patty playing herself in the final act ) , one would think a crack TV - director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together on film , but "" Call Me Anna "" is a pale shadow of Duke 's autobiography . For those who have n't read the book , the sketchy narrative ( leaping forward in time ) is n't absorbing , we are never allowed to get our bearings with what 's happening , and the production seems stunted by a low budget . The actors are miscast , and the value of having Duke herself finally appear does not pay off -- the film 's phony reality is so thick at this point that Patty ca n't bring stability to the scenario . It appears as if the producers were sincere enough ( and consciousness - minded ) to anxiously steer the film towards Duke 's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom , but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process ."	0
"This is the magnum opus from the Swedish king of crap , Mats - Helge Olsson . Seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in Sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in Swedish film to date . Who pays for these things ? < br />The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden . But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden . This trickery is their way of seeing to that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet . The CIA however is bent on getting Markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him.The practice of having Swedish actors speaking English is something that Mats - Helge has perfected in his later works . The cheap b - movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance . But besides this ? Well the action is standard direct - to - video style . Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke . Thousands of Russians dying . People running around in black ninja suits , trying to hide in the snow.What really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed . When they say "" Ninja "" in the title i expect martial arts , i expect close combat . But there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie . And they are hilarious . It 's so bad i lack the words to describe it . If the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop . And of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special - effects budget consisting of four food - stamps and a McDonald 's voucher.So what 's the verdict ? Instant classic of course . Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol . It 's the ultimate party movie . Insert into video and laugh . One just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more . This is film history.Therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment , 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents ."	1
"The Angry Red Planet ( Quickie Review ) < br />Like "" The Man From Planet X , "" this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing . Meaning , we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo - science masquerading as science fiction . And yes , it 's another "" classic "" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound -- by Midnite Movies.So , the main reason to watch this film ? Oh , it 's definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars . ( What , you thought "" Angry Red Planet "" referred to Neptune ? ) Prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship , inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the "" puny female "" member of the crew . It 'd be somewhat offensive by today 's standards if it were n't so damn funny . But Mars is the real reason we 're watching this thing . The film is generally black and white , but Mars , well Mars is screaming bloody red . It 's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness . It 's really quite a sightas are the ( ha ha ) aliens viewers are to witness . The best being the "" ratbatspidercrab . "" You think that 's a joke ? That 's what they call it in the movie ! It 's a gigantic chimera ( small puppet ) of a thing combining traits of rats , bats , spiders , and crabs . It bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our "" heroic crew . "" There are other weird , and poorly imagined , aliens to be seen , but that one takes the cake . Eventually , after their harrowing experience on Mars , the sexist crew boards their "" ship "" and returns to whatever planet it was they came from.This ai n't for everyone . Science Fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers , and some general film buffs . Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with this one ( if they never got to it on the show).2/10 Modern score , 6/10 Nostalgia score , 4/10 overall.(www . ResidentHazard.com )"	0
One wonders how the script came to be written.Wayne and the other performers do an OK job but as it is neither comedy , romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.One feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile . It is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the USA became directly involved with the war . I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.Nonetheless it has historical value .	0
I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it . But this movie was terrible . I have yet to see why people thought it was funny . The idea behind it is stupid . Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb . Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me !	0
"I just read the plot summary and it is the worst one I have ever read . It does not do justice to this incredible movie . For an example of a good summary , read the listing at "" Turner Classic Movies "" . Anyway , this was one of my favorite movies as a young child . My sister and I could n't wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies of it 's time . It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch . The romance is clean and endearing . The story line is interesting and the songs are great . They do n't make movies like this anymore . Good acting and not over the top . Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best , along with many other great character actors ."	1
"yeah right . Sammo Hung already acted in the main role in 1983 's "" Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain "" . Now , 2001 , he does it again with "" Zu Warriors "" . But this time , he finally does it right . You seldom see him in wuxia , more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick . But this role simply does fit him ! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies ( as far as I know about movies translated for the west ) . Although , the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities . Straight said : you have n't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie ! And that makes it so great ! And wow : all the colors plus the enormously deep , right - into - the - heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant . The first time I watched it , I had to watch it again instantly , and I did . OK true , I did n't understand all of it the first time . But that makes it only better ! You know , you did n't understand all of it , because there is so much spice in it ! Therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again . And yeah , it grows deeper in your heart , the more often you watch it.Summary : A story to love , characters you cry with , and truly : a movie you never forget ! -- Editors note : well , I think I must watch it right now again :D"	1
"I thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out.Since I had already seen the original , when I saw this on Sci Fi Channel- I do n't know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was within the first few minutes . Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor , I wanted to see how he would pull it off.The writers / producers etc , modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the "" aliens "" ( They could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help ) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90 's . Maybe it added a bit of polish to the film , or not.This film . Film ? This production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- The original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place , although no resolution of the Alien 's problem.I sort of remember that in this remake , the woman became rather hostile towards the Burgi / Alien- I think it could have ended better . But the ending is just the ending , and the yarn is a swell yarn , being of the basic 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock . Many great science fiction stories were written in the 50 's and some of them even made it to film.This is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something . I rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50 's Sci Fi , this one came off well . I actually enjoyed this quite a bit.But if anyone really wants to see this story told WELL , I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott , directed by Gene Fowler Jr."	1
Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie , I still found it to be absolutely amazing . It will touch you , and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie , or you just simply are n't touched by anything , it is worth seeing . Do n't come into the movie expecting anything , just have a box of tissues and an open mind . It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant . I think Will Smith , despite that he 's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual , is amazing . I believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst / best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes YOU feel something . And that 's exactly what this movie does . Give it a chance .	1
"Wow what an episode ! After last week seeing Mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of Annie and Brandi I almost puked . But that was nothing until seeing Mellisa 's tirade after being fired . Seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality TV . She continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes "" all of them "" like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits . Mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums ? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandie every name in the book , and gets up and quits the show ! Both Rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up . Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview , just proves to America what everyone thought , you are a spoiled baby . WAH WAH I ca n't get my way ! I love how Annie told the cameras she could manipulate Mellisa to think her way , and then did exactly that . Mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game ."	1
"Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm . Not so this gloriously bent , batty and berserk over - the - top Italian - made shot - in - Canada kitsch gut - buster : It 's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over - baked "" what the hell 's going on ? "" crackpot excess and inanity.A freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70 's disco stud ( complete with jumbo wavy afro ) perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice . They dethaw the beast , jolt him back to life with electric charges , grossly mistreat him , and keep the poor hairy Goliath in an enormous glass booth . Before you can say "" Hey , the filmmakers are obviously ripping off ' King Kong ' , "" our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage , grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen ( the gorgeous Pheonix Grant ) he lays lustful eyes on , and storms away with his new lady love . The yeti gets recaptured and flown to Toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience . Of course , he breaks free again , nabs the vixen , and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.The sublimely stupid dialogue ( sample line : "" Philosophy has no place in science , professor "" ) , cheesy ( far from ) special effects ( the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy Tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw - dropping awfulness ) , clunky ( mis)direction , and a heavy - handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere "" Is the yeti a man or a beast ? "" ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen . Better still , we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew : the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti 's nipples , which causes it to harden and elicits a big , leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth ( ! ) ; the vixen nurses the yeti 's wounded hand while he makes goo - goo eyes at her , the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building , and the furry fellow even breaks a man 's neck with his toes ( ! ! ) . Overall , this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should - be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that 's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following ."	1
All the folks who sit here and say that this movie 's weak link is the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist . Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones . How anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of Joey Ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy - o . Ms Trogar , exploding white mice , the hall patrols ... instant classics . Nevermind the Riff Randell character.If you do n't like the Ramones then you do n't know rock and roll and you do n't deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School .	1
"This series premiered on the cable TV station "" Comedy Central "" in the United States . It was chopped to death , and shown out of sequence . This was sad for the audience it should have attracted , it did n't and fell by the wayside . Luckily , at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC . Thank goodness because I got to see "" The League of Gentlemen "" in order , complete and uncut . < br />""The League of Gentlemen "" troupe is right up there with England 's "" Monty Python 's Flying Circus "" and Canada 's "" The Kids in the Hall "" . But .. a warning.""The League of Gentlemen "" though are one step beyond . It 's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills , it goes deeper and much , much , darker . I can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people , it will enrage others . But remember , its only comedy .. dark , dark comedy . If that is not your thing , do n't watch . If you think you KNOW dark comedy , watch this -- if you get angry and upset , then you do n't quite know DARK COMEDY . < br />These guys got it right , and right on the button . They are brilliant , they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation . There 's a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end . You can not watch this one episode at a time , willy nilly , that is one of the charms of this series . Watch it in order . See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are . No one and nothing is out of bounds . That , my dears , is "" dark humor "" . Bravo !"	1
Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together.Yes , Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable , but that 's not what I love about the movie . I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful . It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film.The witty dialogue , great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie . I loved this movie the first time I saw it and on each subsequent viewing I always notice at least one new detail . To me , that is a mark of a great film.The dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period ( early 30 's ) . I adore classic movies , but I admit that most of them are just average and at times do n't hold my interest . Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions.This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a ' pre - code ' movie . ( The Hays code was not enforced until a year after Hold Your Man . ) This movie could not have been made under the code . Well , it could have been made , but it would have been an entirely different story . Thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 . Otherwise , we would have missed out on this gem .	1
"Let 's put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980 's because I for one do n't think this is any better or any worse than the others . Unless your some religious kook or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and I personally had a totally innocuous feeling towards this before and after watching it . Story is set in Albuquerque , New Mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named Phillip "" Philly "" Fillmore ( Eric Brown ) is naturally horny as hell and starts spying on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father.*****SPOILER ALERT * * * * * Nicole Mallow ( Sylvia Kristel ) is friendly to Philly but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to flirt with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her undress . Philly is awkward and does n't know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that Nicole has died from a heart attack ! With the help from the sleazy chauffeur Lester Lewis ( Howard Hesseman ) they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a blackmailer shows up and Philly must get $ 10,000 out of his father 's safe . Philly is shocked when Nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an extortion plan set up by Lester and that she only went along with it because she 's an illegal alien and if she did n't do what she was told Lester would have called the immigration office . Together they try to get his father 's money back before he returns home and they enlist the help from Jack ( Ed Begley Jr. ) who is a tennis instructor but pretends to be a cop to scare Lester.This little comedy was made for less than $ 3 million but it grossed over $ 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which prompts me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre . Director Alan Myerson can boast that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television . So ... why did this become so successful ? I have a thought that it just may be because of Kristel and before you decide that I 'm crazy listen to my reasoning . Kristel was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an American film that was getting a wide release . With that , the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of lovemaking by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film . Anyway , that 's my thought and if anyone has another reason I would love to hear it but back to the film itself it 's apparent ( and very sad ) that a film like this could probably never get made again ( except in Europe ) because of the religious right and the other prudish freaks who just ca n't come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm . In fact , it 's a valuable service that ALL BOYS pray will happen to them ! The film itself is clumsy and Kristel 's body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their nipples . The story ( although intriguing in it 's basic form ) is neither very funny or revealing so were left ogling the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre ."	0
Well , it 's yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film . But I 'm a sucker for those so I gave it a good score ... the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling . The violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change . I 'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end ! All in all a good movie with very good actors.<br / >	1
"While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching "" Lost "" , I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar - bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since . The show , that is . Not the polar bear . So bear ( heh ) with me while I throw out as much rambling , semi - coherent praise as I can muster.""Lost "" takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island , and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them , who are they ? Where did they come from ? It soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives , whether they 're running away from something ( Sawyer and Kate among others ) or getting in touch with spirituality ( Locke , Claire ) . But "" Lost "" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses ... and they all seem to be strangely connected.While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities , most of the cast of "" Lost "" are , in truth , spectacular actors for their respective parts , projecting heart and humour in their performances . There 's also a multitude of eyecandy , but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind as most TV shows . The characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch . Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness , petty arguments or cheesy melodrama ( although they are annoyingly secretive )  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action . The realism of these characters facilitate an already well - sculptured plot . < br />About this plot ... Imagine a tree as the template plot , then the branches as subplots ( in this case , one branch for every character )  well , Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines . If you 're a brother / sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks , you will get your own storyline . If you 're a DOG you will have your own storyline . Unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end , they are setting themselves up . I am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop - out to this show , as I 'm sure most people are.But assuming the writers do pull this off , "" Lost "" is possibly the best show ever to hit television.9/10"	1
I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director ca n't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it . If it 's using the original words in an updated setting , that 's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles , eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively . It could work with the 30 's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare 's text . Unfortunately , it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show . < br />Another problem is Branagh himself . I agree he 's far too old to play one of the students but more important , he 's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student , his strength of acting shows all the time . Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students . Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King , thus an unimposing so - called King with no Kingly attributes . < br />The amount of song and dance , which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing , unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically . So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection , and I got very bored , including with the comic turns , and was glad when it ended . Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan , absolutely splendid as the older couple .	0
"I was very surprised how bad this movie was . Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far . I was hoping for a rerun of Hero , but this is much , much worse.This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place . No believable characters ( even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies , these characters are ridiculous ) , virtually no plot , and ridiculous story twists.This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child . Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense , they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ( "" Ah ha , you only think you 've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns , but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon , so your ray guns do n't work and I 'm invulnerable to your super powers .... tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one . "" ) Children can continue with this lunacy , because they do n't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time . However , for the VIEWER , especially the adult viewer , this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas.SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers , ( a ) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP , in which case your kung fu is not strong , ( b ) if you repeatedly fall on your back , which has a knife in it , it will hurt more and do more damage , unless it is a fake prop , ( c ) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife , you die , especially in ancient china where there is n't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner , ( d ) kung fu fights do n't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls , and ( e ) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations.In any event , go watch Hero again , because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible ."	0
"Man , what the hell were the people who made this film on ? And more importantly where can I get some ? The opening scene sets the tone for the film : a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire , transforming into a werewolf . And this is no Rick Baker ' American werewolf ' transformation , folks . We 're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here . I can just imagine some stoned Italian spreading glue on naked Annik Borel ( who plays Daniela , the film 's protagoness ( is that a word ? ) ) , and asking her to roll in fur . That 's how bad it is.From here on in it does n't get much better . Minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about Daniela and her condition or something ( I ca n't remember , but the dialogue is so bad if you do n't laugh at it you 'll cry).The funny thing is Daniela is n't even a werewolf , she 's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around ( understandable , as she was raped as a child ) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor ( the opening scene ) . She ca n't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets , and she only wants to be loved ! Things start looking up for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who does n't trigger her ' episodes ' . Check out the montage here , one of the cheesiest you 'll ever see ( laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).Daniela 's luck does n't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn , she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman . Reminiscent of "" I spit on your grave "" , Daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists.This is 100 minutes of my life I will never get back . But hey , that 's the game you play when you 're a film geek ."	0
This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10 , 2002 through April 14 , 2002 in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace , Caracas Venezuela.The pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain , sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of President Hugo Chavez.One comes away from viewing this film that Hugo Chavez is truly a great historical figure . Hugo Chavez 's persona single - handedly brought the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old military - installed junta and re - establish the democratically installed government of Venezuela.It is obvious from the film footage that George W Bush aided and abetted the Venezuelan coup d'etat . That the mainstream media aided and abetted George W Bush is not surprising.What is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of America 's mass media.It has taken only 20 years for Ronald Reagan elimination of the Fairness Doctrine in 1986 to turn America into blind and rudderless state.May Hugo Chavez open patriotic Americans ' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true American vision .	1
"In my opinion , this movie 's title should be changed from "" Only the Brave "" to "" All About Lane "" . I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome . Although , I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale . The performances of Marc Dacascos , Tamlyn Tomita , and Jason Scott Lee were all great . However , the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie . Sorry Lane , you are just not a film actor . Stick to what you 're good at - theater acting . Gina Hiraizumi 's performance in this film was also horrible . She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen . There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were n't they cast for that role ? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences . The Japanese - American soldiers do n't look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone . Granted this was a low budget feature , but since this was a war - based film , is n't it important to show some actually fighting ? This film was a worthy attempt , but definitely not worth a major distribution ."	0
"After too many bad memories , I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence . I recently watched it again just to remind me why . I 've always considered this the worst ST : TNG episode ( with the exception of "" Shades of Gray , "" which barely counts as an episode at all).I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red - penciled by the author 's Writing 101 teacher : "" SHOW , DON'T TELL ! "" From Deanna Troi 's pronouncement , and everyone else 's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming , dangerous rogue Okona is , to Guinan 's explanation about how funny her droid joke is ( it is n't ) , to the who - cares resolution to the conflict , there is n't a plot point that is n't highlighted and triple - underlined for our edification , and there ai n't a believable moment in any of it . Unfortunately , Bill Campbell , a charming actor in other circumstances , is too puppy - dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot . On the other hand , it could be that no one short of John Barrowman ( Jack Harkness from "" Doctor Who "" ) could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.(Zero points , by the way , to the Data subplot . While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago , he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here . Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)On a good day , you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode . Me , I 'd rather skip ahead to "" Time Squared "" or "" Q Who . """	0
This is n't the worst movie I 've ever seen , but I really ca n't recall when I 've seen a worse one . I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation . What it really was is a soap opera , and a bad one at that . They overplayed the ' conflict ' card to the extreme . The first hour or so seems like a shouting match , with some implausible scenes thrown in.*Possible spoiler*The 40-or - so minute ' memorial ' scene ( with requisite black umbrellas and rain ) to fictitious crash victims was lame , and I thought it would never end . < br />Avoid this one at all costs , unless you revel in ' conflict'.<br / >	0
This is an astounding film . As well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust Chavez , we are given the background picture which describes a class - divided society . Many of the rich , it appears , have a choice with the people 's democratic choice , and are willing to use the military for regime change . ' Be careful what you say in front of your servants ' is a revealing comment . The head of the country 's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president , with US backing , and these young Irish film makers have it all on camera . A great film to educate young people about democracy . We see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated , and force used , in the interests of big business , against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people . Riveting stuff .	1
I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever . What a brilliant idea for a satire -- the genre is rife . Unfortunately , the finished product ( as I think all involved probably realize ) is a catalogue of missed opportunities , not - quite - there performances and ( thankfully ! ) a few extremely hilarious , inspired bits . Janeane Garafolo , who is very striking , looks really bad here , probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny . David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch , trying to hard to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd . Molly Shannon is so funny just SEEING her makes you laugh , but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical . Paul Rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell , the other guys are also really funny ( the nerdier ones ) . I think the problem is the director just does n't move things along at the right pace . He starts out very deadpan , and that sets the monotone . But when he lets things get really outrageous ( the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I 've had all year in movies , the first also coming in a lame movie : Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT ) , it 's just plain funny . I wanted this movie to work so badly , but it just did n't . The clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9 % PERFECT , and the very few songs used are also perfect . This ends up as a medium - bad MAD TV episode , complete with frustratingly overlong sketches .	0
"Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager ( Weems ) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , and his 11 friends who take him on a cross - country trip to see if "" Pimp My Ride "" will pimp out his wheelchair.I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival . It played twice over the course of the festival . This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit , and the spirit of Weem 's friends . I do not say this often about movies , but after watching this movie , I feel moved to do something towards the cause . Every festival this movie has taken part in , this movie has won an award of some kind . It is in the Tribeca Film Festival , and it is going to London and Athens , Greece . I would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the Academy Awards . It is snowballing out of control . If anyone has a chance to see this movie , wherever it is playing , go ! Take as many people as possible , and go ! It is heading to New Orleans for a film festival , then on to Atlanta and Palm Beach , FL . Darius is from Georgia , so I expect the tickets for the Atlanta showing will be sold out quickly , if they are not already . Please , go see this movie ! DGW ( talk about it)-Kish"	1
""" The Cat 's Meow "" contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue , and some fine performances , a few of which surprised me . Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin ( partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer ) ; Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn ; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies ( though why movies never use her real - life stutter is difficult to explain ) . But these elements do n't add up to a successful whole . The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes -- the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well crafted -- but not so hard on the big picture . Several minor characters do n't need to be there , and do n't behave consistently . The basic plot is full of illogic ( e.g. , why does Thomas Ince think it 's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does n't want to hear ? ) , and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome . I 'd like to think a trip on Hearst 's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates . Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type , which is n't really accurate , and the screenwriter 's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible . < br />Strangely , Bogdanovich , who seemed so connected to the Thirties in "" Paper Moon "" , lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties . He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream , which gives the party guests a very artificial look , and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period ( e.g. , "" Yes , We Have No Bananas "" ) . When Hearst insists everybody "" Charleston , Charleston ! "" it looks as if the actors had a ten - minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot . < br />The lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies , I 'm sure , but not this time ."	0
The monster from Enemy Mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community , where he has taken up residence . He 's being hunted by a female doctor - turned - vigilante who is out to exterminate him . This female assassin , who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video , rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a Big Chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monster 's turf . Decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the Island of Dr. Moreau ( and yes , it 's worse than the one with Val Kilmer ) .	0
"WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS , in my opinion , is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic . Anytime Lexi ( Katie Wright ) or Jennifer ( Marley Shelton ) threw up , I wanted to vomit myself . It 's kind of hard to explain why . If you ask me , they should have been more cooperative about things . However , I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say , "" If you ask me , WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person 's body . "" Now , in conclusion , I recommend this movie to everyone who has n't seen it . You 're in for some tears and a good time , so the next time it 's on TV , kick back with a friend and watch it ."	1

If you have trouble suspending disbelief then this is n't for you . Consider : a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own . Think about it ; she makes no attempt to locate the mother , who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the Italian equivalent of Social Services makes any attempt to put the baby into ' care ' ( no Social Services ? now I KNOW it 's a fantasy ) . Before you know it young Toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he emerges a HAPPY man who loves everybody . In nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide Shantytown residents and for an encore he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the Shantytown stands when oil is discovered there . This wants some swallowing without the subsequent ' miracles ' beginning with Toto 's dead mother ( the old lady who raised him rather than his biological one ) appearing to him and handing him a dove which doubles as a magic wand allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the rainbow.On the other hand the film is up to here with Charm and is easy to surrender to . On balance a small masterpiece .	1
Back in the day if Marion Davies had had her druthers and did n't just listen to William Randolph Hearst , she 'd have done more films like Show People and been a lot happier . In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy , she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith . < br />What you 're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real Davies , a gifted comedienne , a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person . She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire , she put up with her share of pretense in her Hollywood stardom.If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story . I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story . Marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others , looking for that big break . She wants to drama , but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics . She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face , but learns her trade . And also wins the heart of young comic actor William Haines.She does get her first big break , but it does n't come for Haines as well and Marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli , playing Andre Telfair , a pretend no account Count of Avignon . Somebody here was taking a shot at actor Lou Tellegen , lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell of it , one of the most despised people in cinema.Show People was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves . You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin , Douglas Fairbanks , William S. Hart , Mae Murray , John Gilbert , Eleanor Boardman etc . , just being themselves in and around the film colony . That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like , Ai n't We Got Fun , I 'm Sitting On Top Of The World , You 'd Be Surprised , California , Here I Come . As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced , a song called Crossroads was introduced in it . It 's not a bad number , but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack . I guess since they 're not seen , it was felt no billing was necessary . Still I 'd like to know and I 'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People.It 's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite . She looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience .	1
I loved this movie ! ! ! The characters were people that you could feel for . The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind . Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life . The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well . The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together . The most touching scene however , was the young couple at his great grandfather 's house . I laughed in parts , cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie . In fact I 've re - watched it about 5 times . A definite must see for total romantics .	1
"As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick , I said "" I have to watch this movie "" . She 's the undisputed main character , Domino , a bounty hunter . Her "" job "" , as the "" no action "" scenes would teach us , reflects her rebel , violent attitude to life . I have to admit that it 's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters ' hands . So , this stomped me a bit . Anyway , for all the John Woo 's fans , there are helicopters falling down , explosions , gunfire as if it would rain , and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns , one per hand . The cast is absolutely brilliant . Going beyond Keira , which in this movie is a real tomboy , pretty much different from the lovely action figure we 're used to see , Mickey Rourke is back , with his usual slap - throwing face and his potent body . Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well , as a reality show producer.Let 's go to the contents : this movie has a journalistic shape . The talk show scene is "" disgustingly "" real . Anyone that watched that load of . . . you - know - what , can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations . As well as the producer , when Domino 's mom says that the reality that should show Domino 's life is "" trash ; no offense "" , he answers "" I do n't take it like an offense "" . This movie portrays a difficult life . Domino , coming from a world that did n't want her , Ed ( Mickey Rourke ) , a bounty hunter "" not so bounty "" , Choco ( the third guy of the band ) , which family is ( using Ed 's words ) , "" the correctional institutes he 's been "" , and Alf , the driver / bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation . This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born "" without the shirt "" ; unlucky , violent , and with nothing to lose , excepts their ( as they would consider ) miserable lives . The intro of the movie says that it is "" inspired by true story . . . more or less "" , so I could n't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true . Anyway , going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons ( which could have been "" added "" to make the film easier to see , and be classified as an action movie ) , the characters ' story is too realistic to be "" edulcorated "" . < br />The interaction between the characters is various , well studied , and definitely not boring . What has n't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist ( Lucy Liu , sober as never in her acting career ) . It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story ( and that 's a story ) . Probably , the only "" con "" , in a movie with a lot of "" pros "" . < br />All in all : This is n't "" SWAT "" . The characters are crafted ; they have an identity , a shape . They have a name and a surname ( not just "" Gamble "" and "" Street "" ) . It 's the case to say , it 's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet ."	1
"The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers . In my view it would have been better to leave this out . I think the directors tried too hard , perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop . The comment of one of a policemen - "" this ai nt f***ing Disneyworld "" is apt.Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events . The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times , no other footage from the day matches what they shot ."	1
First time of seeing Buster Keaton 's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish I 'd stumbled across it years ago . The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion , and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . So , it 's rocky viewing in places , but I 've seen and survived much worse.It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance it 's inventive and funny from the start to the finish : In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , No Parking signs in Latin ; In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages , a never ending tussle . Favourite bit : As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two!Great stuff , reaffirming my love of silent film comedy .	1
A film I expected very little from , and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be . Roll is an excellent if none - too - serious little story of ' country - boy - lost - in - the - big - city - makes - good ' , it is funny throughout , the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of Matt , said country boy and local Aussie Rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . He is supported superbly by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny . Watch out for these two.Highly recommended .	1
I had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have FAILED MISERABLY to do . This film was void of all the video whore clichés , and it also skipped the gangsters , rappers , and foul language . It examined several relationships among physicians , African Americans , and African American male / female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level . I was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues . The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time . I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well . It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences . Black People ( and EVERYONE else ) would LOVE a movie like this- if only the industry was SMART enough to put them out there!As an extra- if your a doctor , a resident , a medical student , a premedical student , married to a doctor , have a doctor sibling , have a doctor in the family , or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well . It portrayed residency and the practice in a true - to - life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors , residents , and medical students who viewed the film . Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that is greatly apparent .	1
Turkish Cinema has a big problem . Directors are n't interested in global cinema . They are local and folkloric , but want to be international . This brings kitsch results such this movie.Film has jokes translated to Spanish from Turkish and they do n't have any meaning for non - Turkish audiences . Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years.Players , even Ferhan SENSOY have a worse acting than average . They act like puppets.Movie was shot in Cuba , but nothing includes about Cuba . So Cuba is thought like a banana republic.Waste of money , waste of time .	0
"This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . Generally speaking , I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . And this one is GREAT ! Besides Meryl 's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise , the movie 's greatest asset is the story it is based on . The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture , after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye - opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans , and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people ( the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example ) are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would , for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices , shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . The other face of the so - called "" civilized "" society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings ( needless to say , this is very general , even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia ) , that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought - provoking ."	1
Comment this movie is impossible . Is terrible , very improbable , bad interpretation e direction . Not look ! ! ! ! !	0
"The movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates , then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you ( and even his "" friends "" ) really ca n't stand . It is a pretty interesting concept ; film dates on a quest to find true love in modern LA . The problem is that it feels incredibly ( and badly ) scripted at times and blatantly self - promoting . It is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer / actor is so egotistical , uncool , untrue , and simply unlikeable . You end up feeling sorry for his dates ."	0
"Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style , Gabriele Muccino 's project is rather mediocre . The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end : hearts human and emotional , eyes physical and metaphorical . Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu 's Amores Perros and 21 Grams , with lots and lots of flashbacks . The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie . That 's too bad , because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically "" good "" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands ."	0
"Where the Sidewalk Ends ( 1950)Where One Ends , Another Begins < br />This is a prototypical film noir , and as such , pretty flawless , from both style and content points of view . The photography and night settings are first rate ( cinematographer Joseph LaShelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene ) , and the close - ups on faces pure expressionism . I can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone , even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks . < br />But the acting is first rate here , and the plot features what I consider the core of most noir films , the alienated male lead ( representing the many men returning home to a changed United States after the war and feeling lost themselves ) . In fact , not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as the troubled , loner detective , he has a small but important counterpart in the film , the lead female 's ( first ) husband , an decorated ex - GI fallen onto hard times and booze . The fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance , overall-- the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal - wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head . The woman transitions from one to the other -- we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie . Even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact , we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order -- turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with it.This movie belongs to Andrews . He plays a far more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler 's Detective Story made just one year later , and Andrews certainly is less theatrical . You could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session . The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon is morally struggling through it all , and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not , might explain why one man gets his girl and the other does n't . Gene Tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic , demurring , and ultimately conventional and "" pretty "" type of woman -- not just a cardboard desirable , but someone you want Dixon to actually marry . < br />The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama , but is effective enough in its play with types and clichés . The bit parts are kept snappy , the small details ( like the portable craps table ) nice touches , far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in Casablanca . But then , Curtiz 's great movie is iconic even in the details -- it makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating , but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring . They come at opposite ends of the war , and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men . Bogart is beginning his active duty , Dixon , and the man Dixon has killed , are all through . Through , thoroughly , but not washed up.It 's no accident that many , possibly most , film noirs have what you would call "" happy "" endings . The man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self , and the moviegoer , then and now , understands just how beautiful that must feel ."	1
"About halfway through , I realized I did n't care about these characters in the least ; however , I watched a bit more anyway . Regrettably , I came back the next day and finished it . I should n't have bothered.If you know * anything * about the film beforehand , you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what 's gon na happen afterward - he 's gon na get on the phone and call people about it ! That was almost as bad as "" Snakes on a Plane "" ( another bad aviation catastrophe flick).I realize this is an old film , and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today . But even by those standards , the acting was embarrassing . These were n't characters , they were stereotypes . I suspect this movie was , more than anything , an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband 's ( Gary Merrill ) career . To no avail however - I have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did.Davis ' playing the happy cripple ( i.e. , a non - glamorous role ) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move . It was n't . It was just boring . She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film , making Trask ( Merrill 's character ) see the truth about love and forgiveness ( although she was less winsome than Tiny Tim ) , calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died.The final scene , where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile , was so affected and over - acted on both ends of the phone line , I almost cringed . I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film.I noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie . If you found it uplifting , that 's great . But frankly , I just found it bad . There are plenty of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were far better written and acted ."	0
"One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in , it ends much to soon ! Than were left looking at the screen like , "" No they did n't ! "" , lol . Good performances all around ! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding ! I knew she would give a solid , convincing performance catching young Victoria 's regality , temper , and vulnerability through out the entire movie . Also , the production is outstanding in every way : style , substance and sensitivity . A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian 's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen , later marrying Prince Albert , than ending with the birth of their first of nine children . It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing . Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen 's attention , than securing her love , before Lord Melbourne(Paul Bettany ) , was engrossing to watch . Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother , which was fury at times , as with her mother and King William ( whom also disliked her mother ) . The acting and scenes were captivating , highly emotional . < br />I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era , and indeed , anyone who loves a compelling true romance story"	1
"Kay Pollack ( the man behind this movie ) is a real great man who tries to share his life philosophy in different ways . He has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy . The message in most of his books and this movie , is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of . The main message is that you can choose to be happy , but hardly ever do that.To watch this movie and learn something very important on life , you have to keep your mind very open and L I S T E N to all the "" hidden messages "" ( or guidelines to get through life ) which most of the parts in this movie contains if you listen and watch . Watch it with your ears.You wo n't learn the meaning of life , but you 'll learn how to live and get the most out of it ...

So i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene , with very few shows i simply WILL NOT WATCH.this show , however , i would recommend to anyone.Quite possibly the most Original series to date , it;s got just about everything i could ask for . A side story , so to speak , about an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted to , a very blatant comedy , and a very well put together voice acting cast ( both Japanese and American translation).If not for the terribly funny aspect to it , it would be , just another anime.More or less , as i have noticed , a ' love it or hate it ' , very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it.Original to the core , with everything you could ask for in an afternoon , bet the house on this series . I 'm ready to ASSURE you that you will enjoy it .	1
"On one level , this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again . On a deeper level though , it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land . I thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said , "" when I 'm not out here ( alone ) for any length of time , I feel unrooted . ""I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists . I 'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee - table books and a couple art gallery installations . But to see his work in motion , captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer 's lens , was a revelation . Unfrozen in time , Goldsworthy 's creations come alive , swirling , flying , dissolving , crumbling , crashing.And that 's precisely what he 's all about : Time . The process of creation and destruction . Of emergence and disappearing . Of coming out of the Void and becoming the Universe , and back again . There 's a shamanic quality about him , verging on madness . You get the feeling , watching him at work , that his art is a lifeforce for him , that if he did n't do it , he would whither and perish.Luckily for us , Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography . Otherwise , with the exception of a few cairns and walls , they would only exist for one person ."	1
"This movie was way over - hyped . A lot of the viewers , who thought this was "" amazing "" must have been into the old school movies , cause the whole movie is set in the past . At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past , so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass , but it just going . Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past , and the 2 do n't mix very well in this movie , even with special effects . You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with . There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did , so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying "" it 's the greatest movie ever done "" . It 's just crap on a stick . It also did n't help that the story line was sooo crappy . I do n't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced , and I also do n't understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this . It 's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... ""It will all be done on a computer "" . This was a movie that should have been on a movie network , because nothing about this movie was revolutionary . I 'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this . Whatever you do , do n't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow ."	0
"I saw this film opening weekend in Australia , anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger , Edgerton , Bloom , Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me . Unfortunately , despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role , the plot was paper thin .... which does n't inspire me to read "" Our Sunshine "" . There were some other plus points , the support acting from Edgerton in particular , assured direction from Jordan ( confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well ) , and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush , much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it . But I ca n't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero ( or was he?) .... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US . Oh well , at least Jordan and the producers did n't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal ... Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey 's excellent "" Secret History of the Kelly Gang "" . 4/10"	0
Enjoyable in spite of Leslie Howard 's performance . Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat , uninteresting character . One is supposed to feel sorry for this man ; however , I find myself cheering Bette Davis ' Mildred . Ms. Davis gives one her finest performances ( she received an Academy Award nomination ) . Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life . * * Be sure not to miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him .	1
I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication . And it 's still not at the top of my list . But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary , almost stunning , and rescue this from being just another tear - jerker . Carter 's depiction of an ALS victim is strong , perhaps even overdone at times ( sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings ) . But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding . Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance.<br / >	1
"I really wanted to like this , but in the end it 's a poorly made film with too few laughs.The politics are spot on , it 's gon na offend the hell out of republicans but that 's what it 's designed to do . That alone gives me reason to chuckle.The problem is , it looks like it was made in a REAL hurry ( like about a week ) . And it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer , which seems to be completely off topic.Turiqistan is obviously Iraq , or Afghanistan , or any other number of countries the US has f**ked with since the 50s . The humour is a little dark ( amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane corporation ) but it IS on the mark , especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction ( "" democracy lite "" ! ) < br />However like a lot of satire criticising the US , it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured . I guess it 's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point . Who knows . I prefer more of a nudge , wink approach - a bit of subtlety .

How much could the general Hollywood director learn from this movie ? All ... when it comes to actually scaring people . This movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer , and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this . All who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie ... it is the best of it 's kind .	1
"90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill ... Mindy prances at the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of "" shepherd 's bread , "" Mindy nearly gets gang - raped ... Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive - in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure did n't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2)After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend "" Pan "" is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road . Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps , "" I 'm going ' to Big Sur ! ! "" But again , it 's a lot more fun to talk / read about than sit through ."	0
"For those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate , there is the duo of the "" Second Renaissance "" shorts . I 'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts , especially since they 're credited as one on the DVD ( and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the DVD ? ) , but they 're informative even if they have a few gaps.What really makes this first part stand out , from the second part and the rest of the animations as well , is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights . Graphic homages to slavery , fascism , concentration camps , and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and humanity 's God - complex . In fact , "" God "" is never really referenced by these shorts , instead replaced by "" Man 's own image"".As far as the shorts go in the collection , "" The Second Renaissance : Part I "" is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion . It 's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become "" the architect of its own destruction . "" Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature , but then again , that 's basically what most of the Matrix series has done , and it 's been a driving force behind its success.--PolarisDiB"	1
On the 28th of December , 1895 , in the Grand Café in Paris , film history was writing itself while Louis Lumière showed his short films , all single shots , to a paying audience . ' La Sortie des Usines Lumière ' was the first film to be played and I wish I was there , not only to see the film , but also the reactions of the audience.We start with closed doors of the Lumière factory . Apparently , since the image seems a photograph , people thought they were just going to see a slide show , not something they were hoping for . But then the doors open and people are streaming out , heading home . First a lot of women , then some men , and one man on a bike with a big dog . When they are all out the doors close again.Whether this is the first film or not ( some say ' L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat ' was the first film Lumière recorded ) , it is an impressive piece of early cinema . Being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons . One simple reason : it is only fifty seconds long . But also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here ; you do n't get to see historical things like this every day .	1

"this movie is made for Asian / Chinese market , targeting particularly fans of Jay Chou , one of the biggest music star in Asian.Jay Chou is a very talented song writer / singer . He is mediocre as an actor , although he did appear in several big - budget productions ( "" initial D "" , "" Curse of the Golden Flower "") . Amazingly , he won both golden horse ( taiwan ) and Hong Kong film awards for "" initial D"".The supporting cast are very well chosen , which appeals basically everyone from China . The cast including many famous movie / TV actors , singers , even sport commentator ( Huang Jianxiang from China ) . However , they were not given enough time to show their talents.The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and writer position . He has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non - coherent scripts . With his poor directing and lam story , the whole talented cast , fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted.However , the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars , maybe even more in Asian , which made this one of the biggest box office success in Asian.The bottom line is : you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted , or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of Jay Chou ."	0
"This film is an absolute classic for camp . That is why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic . Everyone knows the story . Scientist keeps his girlfriend 's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks . Finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar - faced chick 's head on top . The severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant 's remaining "" good "" arm ( his other is not right from a scientist 's earlier failure ) , and the whole place burns down.The movie scared us so much as kids that my friend would n't go into his basement for a year after seeing it . As kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four . Only one of those scary movies was really any good ( the Original "" The Haunting"".)I had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers . Its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies ( complete with porno sound track ) scares the hell out of innocent children , while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing . I could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while I 'd rather go to the Dentist than watch "" Chicago "" again.Seven is the most I can give it , because its entertainment value is mere luck . The film , as cinema , is a disaster ."	1

I mean really , how could Charles Band the head of Full Moon let a total stink - ball like DEMONICUS out . I mean it should never got the green light to begin with . The story is repetitive , the characters are weak at best , there is no real story on Tyranus other then he 's a bad dude . Then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending . That 's right a bad ending , Demonicus rises . The last survivor escapes a deadly cave in , then a picture of Chimera comes to life , cheaply I might add and chases her out . Then as she is walking home ala FUNHOUSE . A statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her . I mean , that makes no sense . What the hell was Charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made , with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies . They could have asked me , I had better ideas then DEMONICUS . THANKSGIVING TURKEY .	0

I thought this was a truly awful film -- I found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times . One or both of the gay male leads was miscast ; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he 'd rather be kissing a dog . The movie covers their long and tortured courtship , highlighting each break - up and make - up , but not developing the reasons in - between in any detail . These reasons would make for some interesting characters , not the fight or the make - up scene in bed ( lame even if you liked the movie).Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters , but it does n't make the film worth renting .

It 's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being ' the best , ' whether of all time , a certain genre , or what have you , but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact , Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made . It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki , the most talented of Japan 's animated directors , and it best captures his strengths as a director , storyteller , and designer , as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes . The version I 'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub ( I know , sacrilege for a hard - core anime fan to not watch it in its native language ) ; there is at least one other English language dub out there , I have it on VHS ( I have no idea from what source ) , and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film . But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu ( voiced by James Van Der Beek here ) , who 's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) literally drops from the sky . It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent , Colonel Muska ( Mark Hamill ) , who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck . To keep things lively , there 's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal , led by the aging but still boisterous Dola ( Cloris Leachman ) . The plot revolves around the crystal 's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa , a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure . It 's all very much in keeping with a fairy - tale setting , but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story , and the plot is peppered with ' gosh - wow ' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.The design work on Laputa , nearly twenty years later , is still revolutionary . Flying machines of all sorts abound , utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking . The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century , with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines . But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution ; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself , and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal , its power , and its danger.Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film , Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography . From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one - man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water , Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about . Though we only see a small fraction of this world , its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it . The film also contains one of my favorite , if not the most exciting , action sequences ever : a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in , all the while trying to protect Sheeta ( who was the one who woke it up ) . Meanwhile , Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her , literally , from the jaws of destruction . From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last - second rescue , the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.It helps that Laputa has an amazing score . Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world , the dewy innocence , the exciting action , and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians . Though he re - recorded it for this DVD release ( which IMO is not an improvement over his original score ) , adding pieces here and there , the score matches the visuals perfectly , a rare total union of sound and vision.This is n't a bad dub . I 'm inordinately fond of the older English dub , and this one over - explains things just a tad in spots , but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those ( and those matched the Japanese pretty well ) . Dola in particular is hard to get right , but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman ( her sons are n't quite as good as the original ) . Paquin does a good job as Sheeta , and Mark Hamill , while I knew it was him early , is more than talented enough to do Muska ( I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more , but Hamill 's good ) . Much of the film rests on Pazu 's shoulders , and Van Der Beek is wonderful . Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub , because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu . Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful , as much as I love this film , I do n't think you 're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version . John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front , and my suspicion is that he , like so many others , simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke ( one of his few films I did n't care for ) , but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement . Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work , and again , this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder . I 'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen ; while that will probably never happen , it 's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD .	1

"First , I realize that a "" 1 "" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst . This movie gets that from me because , as one reviewer points out , it 's not bad in a self - aware , over - the - top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value . It simply misses its mark on every count . * * Contains possible spoilers * * The dialog is completely disingenuous . The continuity is so deliberate it 's painful . Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love , and with his final word the flamenco dancers start . The mock - shock of what 's her name ( see ? I do n't even remember her character 's name , let alone the name of the forgettable actress ) when her husband ( the Baldwin ) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy . The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things . Vegetable carts gone flying . Cars crashing into each other . Motorcycles going down the stairs . People nearly being hit , but remarkably , no one is . Oh , that 's right ... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times , is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds , and an approaching car apparently did n't notice him there . Hmmm . < br />It 's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made . There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money , you 'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing . Now there 's a novel idea . < br />My suggestion : do n't see this film . Do n't rent the DVD . Do n't watch it on cable . There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied ."	0
"The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history . On the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human . Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront , director Jean - Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria 's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy . It 's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that 's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert , The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer . Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure 's entire life , Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria 's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades . The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal . Vallée takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films . Everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria 's story without ever over - encumbering it . Indeed , while watching Vallée 's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element ; and then there 's the film 's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes ' script . Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert 's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri 's original work just as well.Yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life . Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that . Between the sweet , budding romance of Victoria ( Emily Blunt ) and Albert ( Rupert Friend ) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like ( spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany ) , the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic "" nice to look at but dim underneath "" affair so common with these outings.In the end , it 's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria . It 's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details . Of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama ; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable . Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run - of - the - mill escapist piece for aficionados . Somewhere within this gray middle - ground lies The Young Victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions ; beautiful , memorable but most of all , human.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http://www.invocus.net )"	1
"I am a Jane Eyre lover and a purist , and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book , and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them . Jane Eyre is a complex story of great richness and ca n't be delivered properly in a feature - length format , so it needs a TV mini - series . Timothy Dalton 's Rochester is probably the best ever . There has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age . In the book , Jane ( the narrator ) describes him as "" about 35 "" and not young , but not yet middle aged . I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he made this , so that is about right . Also , we only have Jane 's opinion of whether Rochester is handsome . She only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks . As an inexperienced and humble girl , I ca n't imagine her saying she did think him handsome . The actor playing Rochester needs to show us the character of the man , and this is fulfilled to perfection . I love the relationship between the two leads , which is the crucial thing about this story , and the humour of their encounters . Other versions have blown it , but this gets it right . The 2006 version with Toby Stephens ( aged 37 years ) is in progress on BBC1 and is very good indeed , so I will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed.On viewing this series again , after watching the 2006 version , I have decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best ! Charlotte Bronte 's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story . Modernisation just does n't work - it 's a Victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters . This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important ; Timothy Dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor . There are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes , but leaves out unnecessary details , making it to the point and gripping . I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans ."	1
"I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection , and one night I just decided to watch it ; though not expecting much . As the beginning credits roll around I 'm surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company . Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as "" Troll 2 "" , "" Ator the Invincible "" , and "" Quest for the Mighty Sword "" , so I was compelled to watch.As the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent , even though it was unoriginal . The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent . But after a while into the film , the pace started dragging and I found myself thinking "" Okay someone better get killed soon"",or "" Someone better mutate "" . At the onset of this drag , when I was having these thoughts , though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated , however as noted , the gore and effects were n't very good . What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing ; example : first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo , then he 'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone , finally he 'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed-- making the audience ask "" Was he dreaming he was at the zoo ? "" . Like the movie 's pace , these scene transitions got progressively worse.I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good , but towards the end of the film , that is , once you 've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into , hopefully you 'll laugh-- which really , is the only reason to see this movie at least once ; this movie unintentionally runs like a long - winded joke.The costume of the um , thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D ' Amato 's "" Quest for the Mighty Sword "" , which was made in the same year . You 've got ta love Filmirage movies , they 're always re - using the same stuff !"	0
Beautifully done . A lot of angst . Friendship may not endure all , but in the end it 's all that matters , or so a group of friends learn . I have watched it over and over again . The music is also amazing . When Kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets Sho , an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature . In the lawless streets of Mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of Asian races , and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay . A surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does . I could n't get enough of it . Gackt and Hyde do a wonderful job of acting , proving they are more than pretty boys who sing .	1
"What an extraordinary crime thriller ! ! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival . It 's already my second favourite film of all - time after DR . STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.I do n't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions . A synopsis that I 'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers , played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke , are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester , New York . The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time ( before , during and after the robbery ) , and one key scene is repeated at least three times . Ordinarily , that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece . The excitement , the tension , and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed . By the end , I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up . I know that I 've used a few clichés in this post , but I literally was on the edge of my seat . I should mention that the non - linear storyline is quite easy to follow . This is n't the sort of movie where you 'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.The acting is absolutely brilliant all - around , and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting had n't been so perfect . A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke do n't look like brothers , but that 's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook . Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric . Marisa Tomei ( as Hoffman 's wife ) and Albert Finney ( as the father of Hoffman & Hawke ) are also very good in supporting roles . Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark , gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection . The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I 've ever watched , and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes , especially the ones with Hoffman . The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie , often the same notes played over very effectively . I had the music playing in my head the following day , even as I sat through other films . In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph , there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable ( major spoiler , so I ca n't describe the scene ) . Otherwise , this film is pretty darn close to perfect.There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own . As an aside , the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage . Tomei did n't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked "" Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera - shy ? "" That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene ! !"	1
I awake suddenly , aware that I 'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover , and realize it 's a warm Saturday afternoon . Why was I sleeping ? Did I hit my head ? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma 's muscle relaxers ? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy ? < br />No , I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing , and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out.It 's that head - shaking , mouth - agape , shoulder - shrugging bad . But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through . Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me , and when he / she woke up , a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he / she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep , no one will now how awful it is and he / she can keep the $ 425,000 annual salary.You've been warned .	0

She was unbearable throughout the film . Her tom - boy look does not really goes well . Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin . The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie .

There are many police dramas doing the rounds . I am not sure why . It 's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne , a raw recruit , into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area . No attempt is made to glamorise the police . They are truly down to earth , harsh at times and unforgiving , Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition . Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations.This is not a pleasant film . Not one to relax you . There is not much feeling of optimism in it . The police seem to be involved in a losing battle . Tomorrow there will be more bashings , more murders , more family break - ups , and more distressed children . Let 's face it . This is the world we live in.As days go by Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating . The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny , a 12 year old from a broken family . Anne has her own way of patching things up . She turns a blind eye to Benny 's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can . I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce Benny 's father . It set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs . After all , the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children.Well cast but not my idea of an evening 's entertainment ,	1
"Unless somebody enlightens me , I really have no idea what this movie is about . It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it . This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems . And , that´s basically all . When that agent is played by Pacino , one must think that it must be something important . But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is . To one of the best actors in the world , Al Pacino , this is the second movie of the year ( the other is "" Simone "" ) that deserves the title "" the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year "" .

Most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about ; A man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from Boston that fateful morning of September 11 , 2001 . What you probably wo n't know before seeing this film is this : How that would feel ; What do you do with that ; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day ? The story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist Alan Johnson , ( Don Cheadle ) and ex - college roommate Charlie Fineman , ( Adam Sandler ) solidifies and begins to take shape . Characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact , stay with this story , and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate . Real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates . The pain inside Charlie 's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by Sandler , as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined . It 's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen . Cheadle 's Alan Johnson is equally subtle and very Don Cheadle . Always watchable , the ease that 's apparent when Cheadle 's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills . Alan 's relationship with Charlie Fineman is delicate in texture , just as the situation would demand . Fineman does n't want friendship , nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet , the likable quality that Alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like Charlie . It is Alan who has the task of gingerly opening up Charlie 's carefully sealed life . There is inherent danger in the process . The more Alan nudges Charlie to open up , going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist Angela Oakhurst , ( Liv Tyler ) the nearer the danger of pushing Charlie over the edge . It 's an abyss that Charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial . He has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss . Unfortunately , his grief is one thing he can not deny . Sandler withdraws so deeply into his character 's pain during the story 's unfolding that , by the time he meets his demons head - on , the viewer shares his pain almost equally . Alan stands beside Charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home - life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife Janeane . ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) While tending to Charlie 's recovery , Alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man . His reward for helping Charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost . The theme is much like The Fisher King ; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss . Like The Fisher King , the story concludes with the traditional , there is someone for everyone theme . Reign Over Me 's Lidia Sinclair , ( played by the wonderful Amanda Plummer in The Fisher King ) is Donna Remar , ( Saffron Burrows ) a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of Johnson 's , who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement Charlie 's borderline insanity . It 's a good ending to the story , but the one element probably least likely to ring true . Then again , maybe there really is someone for everyone . Devorah Macdonald Vancouver , BC	1
this movie is a very relaxed , romantic - comedy , which is thoroughly enjoyable . Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein , though she does believe in her own skills . Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up . I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein . This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it , while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it ( if that is actually possible , it happens here).I personally found this movie extremely entertaining , especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious ! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension . If you have a cheeky sense of humour , this is the movie for you !	1
In one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting , it never got there.The people are going from one point to another point , with really no point ( if there was one it was very dull ) . There was no action , suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless , so there was no caring what happened to them.All together the movie was pretty boring.I give it a 3/10.I like that it was n't shaky choppy camera - work and if there was music it did n't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous .	0
"In a little town in Montana two brothers grow up . One of them is Norman ( Craig Sheffer ) , the other is Paul ( Brad Pitt ) . Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion , and the lessons of fly - fishing . In this movie fly - fishing represents life , a little.The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action . Probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen , but about the message . Some things do happen though . Norman goes to Dartmouth to study . After six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named Jessie ( Emily Lloyd ) and he is invited to teach in Chicago . Paul has become a reporter and is known as the "" fishing reporter "" . He is famous and it seems he has a nice life , but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much.The movie is very well directed , it has a nice score and all of the actors are good . The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography . The mountains , the woods and the river all look very beautiful . If the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch . Fortunately there is more ."	1
I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies . Well , both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are n't so good in acting , but Tia Carrere is nice and good looking girl , is n't it ? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role so - so mad gangster .	1
"Slash flicks come few and far between now a days , so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard good things about it . Those good things I heard were all wrong .. very wrong ! This flick is bad and I mean BAD . It 's just plain stupid . Everything about it . Especially the killer 's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end . There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick . Just another slasher wannabe with those "" Hip , "" "" Self aware . "" "" Movie savvy "" characters . I 'm so sick of that crap . Someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood , literally ."	0
Not having seen the film in the original theater release , I was happily surprised when the DVD arrived , since this film did not have the wide distribution it merited.Denzel Washington directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors . The film has a very professional look . It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera . He brings a different angle to this film.One of the best things the film has is , without a doubt , the fine performance by Derek Luke . He is an actor who , with the right guidance , will go far , no doubt . His take on the troubled young man , at this point of his life , in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life , up to now , has dealt him , is very true . His Antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give , but no one seems to see that side of his character.At the worst time of his despair , Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport , played by Mr. Washington , in a very sober , if somehow subdued manner . Because of the angst within Antwone , he misses the opportunity of opening himself to this man , who wants to help , but because of the constrains placed on his office , just have three sessions and then has to dismiss his patient.Things work out , as Antwone is able to convince the doctor to keep on working with him . Antwone 's past is revealed in detail . The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs. Tate , his foster mother , is brutal , to say the least . The attempt at the hand of an older woman in the Tate 's household of a sexual molestation , gives Antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life , as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him.Antwone finds love at last with Cheryl , who is patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him.The lead performances are very good indeed . Denzel Washington 's Dr. Davenport has his own problems too . He is not a happy camper either . He can help Antwone , but he can not help himself , or his relationship with an adoring wife . < br />The talent in the film is incredible . Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl . Novella Nelson , who is a fine actress is superb as Mrs. Tate , the abusing foster mother.The reunion of Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental , but of course , if one is to believe that Fisher finds happiness at last , one has to accept that part of the film as well .	1
Los Debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to Santiago from the South after their mother dies . The confident and streetwise Silvio , the elder brother , gets a job working for a sleazy strip club 's owner after taking the naive Victor there for his 17th birthday.As Silvio blossoms under his boss 's tutelage , both brothers get involved with the owner 's sexy and manipulative mistress , Gracia . As the film unfolds , characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one manipulates the next.The film is well made , with good cinematography and fast pacing . It 's also pretty sexy , with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes . It uses the now - popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view , out of chronological sequence . Many people hate movies like this because they do n't understand what 's going on - Memento , Pulp Fiction , Reservoir Dogs , and many other good films use this device . The plot itself is really nothing new , there are elements of Body Heat , Pulp Fiction , and many other good film noir.As the different layers are revealed , our understandings of the characters and their motivations evolve . While the plot may be somewhat cliché , it is also clever and entertaining.I would call it an enjoyable movie , worth watching , but nothing memorable . I have n't seen many films from Chile , and it 's always interesting to see film noir from other countries . Other than that , rent it if it 's available but do n't lose any sleep if it is n't .	1
"The idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked . Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that . When we do get to a point , it is so monumentally moronic that I kept thinking I must have misunderstood it . But I didn't.Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so did n't realise they were sharing . His friend asks "" But what about the weekends ? "" Sean does n't have an adequate explanation . Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem , which is that he is n't sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other . This has been going on for three weeks . But his friend does n't ask : "" Yes , but as I said before , what about the weekends ? You must see her then . It does n't make sense . What are you going on about , Sean ? Are you on medication or something ? "" But let 's be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week.We see Sean checking to see if the soap and towels have been used . ( In fact , bizarrely , he starts to carry the soap around with him . ) But what about his girlfriend 's conditioner and shampoo , sanpro and moisturiser , toothpaste and toothbrush . Let 's go to the kitchen . What about food and drink ? Is any missing ? Has any been bought ? In the bedroom , has the shared bed been made or not ? Are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones ? Is the laundry basket fuller ? In the toilet , is the seat up or down ? I mean , good grief!And to cap it all Paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home . Why does n't he just phone her?But it gets worse . In the last act although no - one told Vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them . Lenny 's love interest and Sean 's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group . There is n't even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences.To be fair the dialogue is OK but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame story.I heard one of actors interviewed and he promised "" no guns , no drugs , no corsets . "" I thought , "" great "" . But after half - an - hour of tedium I was yelling at the screen : "" I want guns ! I want drugs ! I want corsets!""It would n't have taken much to sort these problems out but on the official website the director boasts that the film was n't script - edited . That 's all you need to know ."	0
I think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed , with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax . What cinema goers made of this in the 30s , I can only imagine . The ' Times ' said at the time , ' A miracle has come to the screen . ' Watch it and marvel .	1
This is hands down the worst movie of all time . A combination of Whoopie Goldberg ( the worst actress / person in history ) and a talking dinosaur ala Jar - Jar - Binks add up to a painfully bad movie . That was an understatement . This movie is unwatchable . For the love of God , do not watch this movie .	0
"Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break . Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley , Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... ""Shallow Grave "" is a pleasant low - budget surprise . The cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . Especially the second murder is pretty grim . The murderous sheriff is n't one - dimensional character - in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he 's done . The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10 ."	1
"This obscure de Sica delivers the goods . And it is said "" the meek shall inherit the earth . "" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war . They are homeless but cheerful , in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them , footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers . de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale , a Cinderella story . I have not read the book it is based on so I can not foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio . It begins with the words , "" Once upon a time ... "" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale , for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere . Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone , whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all . De Sica 's most accessible picture is also one of his best . Abandoning neo - realism , he always dallied between that and pure good old film - making , he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world . Gracias Vittorio ! Gracias ! Gracias ! ! ! Gracias ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"	1
I could n't agree more with the other comment , it 's like Falling down . Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt great as always , except in Lost in Space . This is a good movie . With pretty good performances . Very recommendable . If you like Falling down you 're going to enjoy this one . 8 of 10	1
Even though Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to Hitler 's life and yes , this is dramatised , but essential . Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years , during this documentary that only deals with Hitler from boyhood until he became Chancellor of Germany , including The Night of the Long Knives . This TV - film ( also a two - part mini - series ) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to come to power , e.g. the financial disaster of 1930.The series follows Hitler and little else , apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl . All in all , valuable and filled with interesting actors , yet I feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography ; most actors are portrayed in half - body shots which ( for me ) makes for a theatrical stance , not cinematic . The tempo is at times drowsy , and the film does suffer from it , being approximately 2,5 hours long .	1
Big splashy film of the Broadway music . Nathan ( Frank Sinatra ) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games . Blonde loving Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) wants to marry him IF he gives up craps . He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ! ) , who bets big , is in town . He bets Sky that he ca n't get mission worker Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) to go with him to Havana . That may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie!This is a real mixed bag -- there 's some wonderful stuff here . The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible . The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end . Also Brando is really quite good here -- it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off . I have to admit seeing big , bulky Brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun ! Also Sinatra is pretty good and Blaine is just wonderful as his long - suffering girlfriend . Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.Now for the bad parts -- Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she 's stuck with a drab colorless role and ca n't do much with it . The movie is far too long at 150 minutes -- the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have been shortened . Also most of the characters speak in very precise English -- contractions are never used . Maybe it 's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but I found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie.It 's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while . I give it a 7 .	1
"This is a movie of tired , yet weirdly childish , clichés . There 's a Nazi witch master performing sf - related experiments in the basement ? Oh please ! < br />Aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear , the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright . Not having any expectations beforehand , I am left with : an aged Xander from Buffy and a heroine with ape - like face who does n't seem to know how to act . Said Adrienne Barbeau have I only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable "" Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"".Camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame ."	0
"This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie . There are many plots and turns . The story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people . This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James Newton Howard is excellent . Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris . If you liked this one don´t miss "" TRUE CRIMES "" or "" THE HURRICANE "" . My wife and me gave 8/10 ."	1
"In Canadian director Kari Skogland 's film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well - meaning son Marvin . Filmed in Manitoba , Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka , The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century.The title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar 's mother 's grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar 's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego - driven , self - defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well - meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . As she nears the end of her days , she reflects that "" pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . I was alone , never anything else , and never free , for I carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched"".Confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice - over narration . The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married Bram Shipley ( Cole / Wings Hauser ) , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population . The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . Despite Hagar 's pleading , her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty.Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram , Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes . When she produces two sons , Marvin ( Dylan Baker ) and John ( Kevin Zegers ) , she is unable to give them the love that they need . "" Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning "" , she reflects , "" all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearances  When did I ever speak the heart 's truth ? "" Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm.As the scene shifts back to the present , Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris ( Sheila McCarthy ) , Here she meets a young man named Leo ( Luke Kirby ) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story 's outcome , although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John 's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film 's second half ."	1
Very nice action with an interwoven story which actually does n't suck . Interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts . Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps liven it up , too . Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding ! Worth picking up just to see her !	1
"I liked this film very much . The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow . There is no resolution to the story whatsoever , and you are left to wonder what really happened . Since I like that sort of film I enjoyed this . I especially like the "" dating "" scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives . And of course any film with a naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points . ;-)"	1
This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we wo n't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I ca n't think of anything I 've ever seen that was this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cents .	0
"I see quite a few positive reviews on this board , trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following . I see the usual ranting--""I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended , "" "" This movie is not Shakespeare , "" etc . Guess what ? Neither was "" Road Trip "" ! And I laughed my a * * off during that movie ! There 's a way to make a crude , tasteless comedy and deliver laughs ; and there 's a way to ... just make it crude and tasteless . "" Whipped "" tries to be "" Swingers "" without the wit or intelligence . It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year - old boy . For God 's sake , the characters in this movie are supposed to be white - collar , upright citizens -- and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school ! The dialogue is laced -- more like drowned -- with four - letter words . You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence -- and a more extensive vocabulary . Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you 'll see the difference . Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish . If you know any successful , white - collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie -- please let me know and introduce me to them . Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty . There is absolutely NO insight into relationships , sex or ... anything ! ! ! It 's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely -- and do n't take the word "" extremely "" for granted , because I mean it with all my heart -- crude gags . These are gags with no substance . Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs . The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un - called for and totally unconvincing . There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by ( straight ) men and play out wonderfully . This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures . It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman 's mouth . It was one of those noticeably - written - by - a - guy scenes . I was n't believing it for a second . < br />""Whipped "" is purely a sick male fantasy that 's as flat as it is annoying . I got ( very ) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy , and those were probably a result of desperation . When you 're not laughing for a long period of time , you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things . So I would n't mark that down as a positive ."	0
I wo nt take too much time here , just wanted to state that Darkman 3 is awesome . I have all 3 on DVD , added these to my collection of DVD movie sets . Darkman ranks up there with the best , like Indiana Jones , Aliens , Star Wars , Die hard , you get the point . There is n't too many good horror , thriller , sets out there . Many thanks to the whole crew , and set for giving us the Darkman trilogy . By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD . I purchased it through the internet , it is however region 4 , as you know most US DVD players are region 1 . If you own a Sony Playstation 2 , you have the best DVD player since it is an all region player . Just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1 - 9 ) .	0
I personally watched this to see the footage of the 60 's and 70 's . It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life . The interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous . You feel like you 're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar . I loved it , all segments from 60's - present day . I highly recommend this for all aspects , including rock music , the hipper movement , politics and good ' ol history . I check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler , only because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards , since I discussed what 's in all 4 segments , so just wanted to be safe .	1
this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese . Ben Affleck was seriously NOT trying to act in any way , shape , or form . He outright sucked . Nothing about the movie was believable . The first problems were in the intro- where the man gives everything of value to the Salvation Army Santa Claus but it does n't show why . And then the granny sticks her head in the oven- really beautiful , and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie- it 's not even in the same tone as the movie . There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose ; there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose ; and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed ( Example : Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck 's characters go tobogganing down a steep slope- this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him . Riiiight ... ) Anyway , there was a funny moment or two- but they were a rarity in the movie . It seriously needed another rewrite ( or 4 ) . Hope you enjoy !	0
This movie is just plain bad . Weak story , weak directing and below average acting . The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider . It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising . This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this.Do not watch this , it not worth your time .	0
it 's a lovely movie , it deeply reflects the Chinese underground bands ' current lives . if you chinese culture , traditionaled rock n roll music , there you go , i will highly recommend this one .but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in Mainland ? i sorta doubt it , :D	1
""" Plan B "" is strictly by - the - numbers fare except for one thing . I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.Jon Cryer is the "" star "" of this film and plays his usual , smarmy , egotistical , snotty character that was actually endearing in "" Pretty In Pink "" and has NOT been amusing ever since . Grating does n't even begin to describe his performance . Ricky ( Mark Matheisen ) is a muscular , blonde , struggling actor who ( gasp ! ) is only worried about his hair and getting laid . Talk about a stock character ... ugh . At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging . Lisa Darr and Lance Guest play a grounded , optimistic , caring couple who are struggling to conceive . Since they are not whiny drama queens , however , their roles are apparently considered boring and they are n't given enough screen time . Sara Mornell rounds out the cast by playing Gina , your usual nice and good - looking young woman who just ca n't seem to find the right partner in love . I 've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes . They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked . He was portrayed as being wild , ignorant and amazingly shallow . They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays . Gina decides to be gay for a while since she is n't having any luck with guys . Honestly . That was n't that bad except they really went overboard when Gina brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing . Her lesbian date had very short hair ( like I 'm sure all lesbians do ) . She also got quite upset ( like I 'm sure all lesbians do ) when Gina had the nerve to put on lipstick ( ! ) . Finally , her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when Gina expresses her disappointment . Of course , we all know how gay people ca n't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years , right ? ( Please note the sarcasm in that statement . Thank you.)This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but Cryer 's unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema . 2/10"	0
Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che : Part Two , as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds , is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution , no allusion to his experience in the Congo , no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat , no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America , which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity . Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions . Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals , to establish involved relationships . He is reasonably unreasonable . Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind . But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men . It is the concept.In Part 1 , in Cuba , the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages , given food and cover , supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution . Here , in Bolivia , not much understanding is apparent . Villagers expose him . They protect government troops , not his own . When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system , his audience appears uninterested . You can not lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply . Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians , but does n't fault the United States for Che 's collapse . Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it.In showcasing both wars , Soderbergh does n't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results . Che 's men attack and are attacked . They exchange fire with faraway assailants . There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat , its death toll not paused for . This is not a war movie . It is about one man 's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure . There is no elaborate cinematography . Soderbergh looks firmly at Che 's inflexible dedication . There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots , but being few they are all the more powerful , such as Che 's POV shot during his final beats . There is an abundance of the terrain , where these men live for weeks at a time , and the all - consuming effect is of languor , Guevara himself having malaria part of the time.Benicio Del Toro , one of the film 's producers , gives a champion 's performance , not least because it 's modest . He is n't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes . In Cuba , he arises in conquest , in Bolivia , he falls to the reverse , and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair . Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude . You may think the film is too long . I think there 's a genuine cause for its breadth . Guevara 's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches , but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane . In the end , Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie , one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means .	1
"Seriously . I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words have failed me.I remember a time when I would see Charles Band 's name on a film and my heart would race . He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter . He was a bastion of hope for the little man . The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex , but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure.And now ... this.A painfully - obvious Californian walking trail doubles for "" the Alps "" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be "" an ancient cave "" . I mean , they did n't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ! Ugh ! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator , as the cover implies , we 're treated to a dude wearing the latest in Wal - Mart Halloween apparel . There 's a pretty cool looking corpse , who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers , but he does n't even learn to stand until the final five minutes . Why could n't he be the villain ? Instead , we 've got frat boy Joe with a plastic sword . Ouch.Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe . I love movies that are so bad , they 're good . Hell , I occasionally enjoy a flick that s so bad , its just bad . This one , however , is just unwatchable . A perfect example of making a buck , rather than making a quality film ."	0
I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst film I have EVER seen ! I 'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne , where the film was made . Diabolical acting , amateurish makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack . As for the plot , well , that s even MORE stupid ! Some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was . There 's a reason they put these types of films on late night TV - because they 're utter rubbish ! Avoid at all costs .	0
"I have always been a huge fan of "" Homicide : Life On The Street "" so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up , I could n't wait.Let me just say , I was not disappointed at all . It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I 've ever seen . It was great to see everyone back again , but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back , because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all - together great show ."	1
"Weak plot , predictable violence , only semi interesting characters . Like the writer ( also one of the stars ? ) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it "" hot "" . From the predictable rap and house soundtrack , to the family conflicts , it 's poorly acted , stereotypical , and ultimately terribly boring . Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007 - 2008 ! ! < br />Note : Saw it on Showtime , which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies . Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop . Even tho another stereotype , would have made it interesting if it happened ."	0
When an actor has to play the role of an actor , fictional or factual , the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role . In A Double Life , Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John , the tortured double personality . He put into that character all his talent and sincerity . The facial expressions , mannerisms , gait and stance spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage . Coleman also did extremely well as a Shakespearean actor in those short scenes as Othello that were part of this gem of a movie . Closups of Coleman 's face as Othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of Desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching . Add to that , his character 's off stage desperation and only someone with Coleman 's depth of acting perception can achieve . It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , except this double role was much more profound and poignant . Shelly Winters looked so sweet , vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie . It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947 . I would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored .	1
"Anne Bancroft plays Estelle , a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son ( Ron Silver ) to locate reclusive one - time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good . Might 've been entitled "" Bancroft Talks "" as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration . Hot - or - cold director Sidney Lumet ca n't get a consistent rhythm going , and Bancroft 's constant overacting is n't scaled back at all by the filmmaker -- he keeps her right upfront : cute , teary - eyed and ranting . Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario ( not that the thinly - conceived plot has much going on besides ) . Silver and co - stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star , and everyone is trampled by her hamming . * 1/2 from * * * *"	0
I 've seen many horror shows over the years , like Nightstalker , that dealt with the Wendigo legend , so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the Halloween season . Man was I mistaken . The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy , but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property . Ve - ery scary - not ! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor , another total loser.It 's getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies , since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore . What idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made ? Go back to the drawing board fellas , and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around .	0
"I 'm not sure quite why I clicked "" contains spoiler "" , because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.Visually it mostly delivers . Well , apart from some 80 's throwback rubber - mask monsters . I 'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi , nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision . Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band , pretty much in their stage personas . Whatever . Anyway , I did n't know this while watching . I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly passable . Just about.I'm almost sure there is a semi - coherent explanation behind what we see on - screen , but it may actually be better not to know it . It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it . The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained , even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it , especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing . Must have been the mood I was in , but I found that hella funny for some reason . Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it 's supposed to be about . That amused me further , and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.It 's not scary , or particularly coherent , but it 's pretty nice visually and sonically . Overall , far from essential , but watchable . Do n't expect too much and do n't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood ."	0
Heavily re - edited and often confusing , the original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years have n't made it any better . This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer , with Scott Glenn 's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year - old charge , the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family . An interesting cast - Joe Pesci , Brooke Adams , Danny Aiello , Jonathan Pryce - have all done better , the action is sluggish and sparse and only John Scott 's exceptionally fine score ( part of which turned up in the last reel of Die Hard ) makes a positive impression . One case where the remake ( made by Tony Scott , the original choice of director for this version ) is an improvement .	0
I loved it , having been a fan of the original series , I have always wondered what the back story would be - it did n't fail to delight me . I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I did n't recognise one person - this is refreshing , much like BSG . It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - ca n't wait for the series to start airing . Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job . The special effects , dialogue and acting were all spot on , and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment , but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci - Fi stuff produced in the last decade .	1
Made by french brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet , and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how New York 's finest shone on it 's darkest day . I first saw this when I was a young naive 12 year old , and at that age it still touched me . Knowing how serious 9/11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9/11 . We were finding out who the heroes were , how there everyday lives were composed , and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves . These brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them . Watch if you can , this is the best documentary I have personally ever seen .	1
Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting , then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes , with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series . The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow -- and I mean slow -- build - up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader . And when that finally comes , it 's pretty all right . Not great . Not even good . But pretty all right . This movie is being vastly over - praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels . Instead it 's just turgid , dull , and routine . But you have to say , wow , those CGI environments are really impressive at times . Bu the lightsabre fights ? They 're all a blurry mess . I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed . This will make a ton of money , but thank god it 's over , this once - worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough . I saw the 12:01 show , and after it , I heard a group of very small kids say , wow that was awesome ! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing : I fell asleep in the middle . It was kind of boring . I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better . So said we all .	0
SWING ! is an important film because it 's one of the remaining Black - produced and acted films from the 1930s . Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable , but this one is in fairly good shape . It 's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club -- a time all but forgotten today.Unfortunately , while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances , it 's also a mess . The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era -- including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day . However , the writing is just god - awful and a bit trashy at times -- and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning . This is because before the plot really gets going , you are treated to a no - account bum who lives off his hard working wife ( a popular stereotype of the time ) and when he is caught with a hussy ( who , by the way , totally overplays this role ) , they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown ! And , the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor -- a trashy scene indeed ! Later in the film , when the prima donna is behaving abominably , her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him ! It seems like the film , at times , wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they ca n't even do this well -- with some of the worst acting I 've seen in a very long time.Still , if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way ( with trashy characters , bad acting and direction and poor writing ) , this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing -- as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture . Just do n't say I did n't warn you about the acting -- it 's really , really bad !	0
Well , it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but I feel I must say something . I was n't exactly looking for ' a splatterfest ' as someone puts it or even ' blood and guts / gore ' . I have some respect for the victims relatives although I really felt the filmaker DIDN'T. -They were nameless , faceless and meaningless . Just a vessel for Dahmers sexual antics.I watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think ' What makes a guy be a serial killer ? ' as well as wondering the specifics about the Dahmer story , of which I know very little . People here seem to think that the movie did n't have to cover the events of the Dahmer story .. I.E. his history , what happened when he got caught , the aftermath , etc but IT IS IMPORTANT ! You see , I assume if you are American you WILL KNOW all of this . We do not all live in America . To tell this story about such a man as he obviously was , REQUIRES that at least SOME of the history and actual events are told / shown . This does n't mean blood and guts , there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore . Without even touching upon some of what he did ( I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site ! ) , the movie felt like a void . A moment in time with very little substance . I would like to know if there is a film about the REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction , VERY slow pace that NEVER changes , Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unfortunate lack of ANY attempt at an ending , this movie is POOR . I would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it . A definite 1 out of 10 ( for the acting ! )	0
I saw Insomniac 's Nightmare not to long ago for the first time and I have to say , I really found it to be quite good . If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you will love it . The hole movie takes place inside his mind -or does it ? The acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end . The extras on the DVD are just as great as the film , if not greater for those Dom fans . It has tons of candid moments from the set , outtakes and a great interview with the director . Anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch Tess ( the director ) , Dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film . It was pretty enjoyable and I 'm glad to have it in my collection .	1
ELEPHANT WALK was a thoroughly dull film and I really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film . Considering the money and cast , you 'd sure expect the film to be a lot better , though I also question the odd casting of Dana Andrews as a man who is in love with Elizabeth Taylor . It 's not just the age difference but I just ca n't see the pair as a couple . Perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting Miss Taylor for Vivian Leigh at the last minute ( due to Miss Leigh 's deteriorating mental condition)--though I also have a hard time visualizing Andrews and Leigh as well . In addition , for an English woman , Miss Taylor does n't even seem to try using an accent.The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England . Their plan is to return to Finch 's tea plantation in Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) and at first it seems like a good life . However , there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her . On top of that , once back home , Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable . Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her . However , Taylor is n't yet ready to abandon her marriage . But , through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave ... when out of the blue , Cholera strikes the plantation . So it 's up to Andrews , Finch and Taylor to work together to save the day -- though by this point I really did n't care , as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters , the dialog is pretty dull and you ca n't understand why Taylor did n't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell.The film is n't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount , the film is a sluggish mess . I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location , many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected ( and grainy ) shot that was n't integrated well . In one scene , for instance , Taylor , Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green . Then , when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them , the grass is brown ! It 's clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha . My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake . Despite its budget , it 's just not a very good or inspired film.By the way , could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film ? In some scenes ( particularly at the beginning ) she 's wearing billowy clothes , has a double - chin and looks puffy . This is n't a criticism -- after all , women do get pregnant ! But if you look carefully , you 'll see what I mean.Also by the way , the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANT -- a great Taylor film indeed ! It 's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much .	0
Yes , this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre . Still , I did not like this one at all . About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie , she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life . Crappy sex scenes to follow . Why are they crappy , for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act . I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not . Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way , but it is still very erotic and nice to look at . Of course the girls in that one are very cute . Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things . If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film . The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean there is a snake in one of them people . So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all , but rather turns me off .	0
"You do realize that you 've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years , right ? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co - exist on an Island , but you 'd think that after watching unkempt , stink - ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original ( and interesting).And I 'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable . It 's just hard to suspend disbelief for "" Bushy Bill "" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make - shift bio - dome sipping frosty mochcinno 's with moxy.What 's the appeal here ? I do n't care about these people or their meandering lives . I just do n't get it . But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy , unwashed people , I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat . They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE , and free of charge , you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters , eventually striking "" pay - dirt "" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein - styled cancer - stick , all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "" Aqua Velva "" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise .

"As you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that I do n't like Johnny Test . Now I think I know what people are going to say , "" How do you know how bad it is ? Have you ever watched it ? "" , I did watch this show a couple times because I am studying film and animation and this just does n't hold a candle to my standards.I want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things I have ever seen . Like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation . I thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.So that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show . It tries way too hard to be like Dexter 's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female . There is a talking dog(why ? ) , and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat . I have others but I do n't think I can write them here ( I do n't mean cursing but I mean I do n't know if there is a limit for words . ) . Everything else though is spot on , even a DeeDee character Johnny himself . It just tries so hard to be Dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.Lastly I want to talk about the jokes . Remember in Dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling ? Yes , yelling can be good for a joke or two but Dexter 's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke . Johnny Test just forgets all that and just yells 50 % of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears . That is n't comedy , that s stupid comedy ( I know what some people are thinking . Is n't three stooges stupid comedy ? Watch that and Johnny Test back to back and you laugh more at the first option . ) . Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which , like Chowder , makes me mad . I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together : To much bizarre does n't equal comedy , it makes you just think "" what am I watching?"".So it strikes out on all accounts . Do n't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway , shape , or form ."	0
"First off ... I never considered myself an Uwe Boll Hater since I think I never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named "" Seed "" ( which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about ) I am close to joining the hate club . This movie makes absolutely no sense at all ... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 % of this movie is just plain boredom . You can sum up this movie like this : < br />1 . Hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on TV . This is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of "" making a statement about humanity "" and giving a Peta address . Since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn - exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward.2 . Death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it.3 . Cops watch videos of animals , babies and women starved to death and decomposing in Seeds basement , having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because Seed is such an evil bad mofo . Although the acting is OK the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions ... < br />4 . Cops bust Seed in his house , act stupid and get slashed in the dark . This sequence reminds me of a video game , you barely see anything except flashlights . Seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed ... except for one who busts him.5 . Seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this "" movie "" ... he wo n't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts . Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem.6 . Seed comes out of his grave , kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on.7 . A woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it . < br />8 . Seed captures the cops family , lures him to his house , threatens to kill his wife and daughter . After killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering that s what s Seed wants ( its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ... the movie has barely any dialog anyway so do n't mind).9 . Boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where Seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3.This is it ... no message , no plot , no reason , no face behind the mask , no background except a stupid story that Seed was burnt as a child.This movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value . I hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment . Its like watching August Underground ... that s fine with me , some people will enjoy this brainless snuff . But what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo - message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera - work , effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid . < br />So how does Boll get money to make such "" movies "" when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets ? ? "" Seed "" is not just the essence of ridiculous , its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky Uwe that the German taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments ."	0
"Two qualifiers right up front : I actually think Joe Don Baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director ( the "" Cape Fear "" remake , a small role in "" Goldeneye "" , "" Walking Tall "" ) . And I even liked Baker in "" Mitchell "" , because he was playing an anti - hero who was SUPPOSED to be unlikeable . Yes , MST3 K 's coverage was hilarious , but they took a lot of cheap shots at Baker - that he did n't deserve - to keep things lively and entertaining - he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie , and he was the best part of the movie.""Final Justice "" seems to be more of the same , but in spite of the exotic locations and the "" cowboy frontier justice "" theme , it is quite a bit weaker than "" Mitchell "" . And the main reason is that Baker 's character , as written , is an idiot . The movie has the conceit that because Baker embodies old style frontier machismo , he challenges his opponents to old style mano - a - mano quick - draw contests . And because he 's so tough and macho , he always wins , even when he 's hurt , wounded , outnumbered , etc.That 's a conceit with a lot of potential ( it worked for Gary Cooper ) , even if it condemns the film to "" B "" movie status . But Baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guy 's henchman to a showdown in a public market , with civilians all over the place . He COULD have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guy 's headquarters ( which was why he was following them in the first place ) and they never would have noticed . Or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender , and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point . But no , he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead , and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout ! < br />This is a guy we are supposed to admire ? < br />The whole movie is basically like this . Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK ( the henchmen ) to pretty good ( the chief bad guy and his father , who are two well known European actors - they just go through the motions , but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent ) . But through it all , Baker 's character pulls silly , unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed , plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force.On the positive side , since 90 % of the movie is set on Malta or in the Mediterranean , you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras . And really , Baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic , but he is n't that bad ... certainly not the tub o ' lard that this films critics ( including Mike and the Bots in their hilarious coverage ) seem to think.In short , this movie is good for video wallpaper , but the viewer should not pay any attention to it ."	0
This movie was so bad I could n't sit through it without doing something else . There was no plot and no point . I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian , I could n't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description . Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.So how was this made ? Is there no quality control in film ? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.It 's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure . He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy .	0
I love Kristen Dunst , especially in Elizabethtown . I guess she 's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . She did that , and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown . In this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . While in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and I just could n't tell her to be an editor any way . Therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . < br />The film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring . the character of Young is full and reasonable . Anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . < br />The only big defect is that it did n't show a turning point of the hero and heroine 's love story . I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons .	1
Michael Williams , who works for BBC , finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART : A DOCUMENTARY . But since his wife 's mysterious death her daughter , Emily , has been emotionally disturbed , so he goes Spoleto , where the problematic picture is , with her and her nanny , Jill . And there is a Countess , who is also a psychic , and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed . Michael does n't believe her story , but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed ... This Italian film is , of course , almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST , but this one is much cheaper , much simpler , and in a sense , much dirtier . First of all , it should be said this film is full of confusion . For instance , the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia . But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks , she perceives her exclusively from a third - person 's point of view . But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia , she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilia 's point of view . Confusions of this kind , which the film has many , are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly , rather than ambivalent , to specify its own quasi - Freudian theme , namely , pre - adolescent girl 's one - way incestuous wish . To make matters worse , this film also has characteristic problem ( if not confusion ) ; every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human . Regarding Emily ( or Emilia ) , she is after all a child , and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness . ( And according to the Freudian theory , every girl wants to have her father 's child(ren ) in her own way . In this sense , Emily is not exclusively pathological ; only her way of excluding other women from her father 's love is problematically pathological . But , as I already mentioned , this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian . ) The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is . And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything can not do anything down - to - earth , and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way . In addition , special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable . Although Stelvio Cipriani 's music is noteworthily beautiful ( indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone ) , the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B - film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-Italian- horror - film - lovers .	0
"Flame in , flame out . That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell , a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon . I 'm not a fan of Japanese monster films , but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci - fi collection put out by Mill Creek / Treeline Films . It 's a great value at about twenty five bucks , so at fifty cents per movie , it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast , and he 's not happy . Like Godzilla , he takes it out on Tokyo , setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet . They arrive at ' Plan Z ' , the hope of the world , and would n't you know it , there 's a scene where a huge shed is shown that 's called the ' Z Plan ' building ; that was a nice touch.By the mid 1960 's , this country still was n't quite politically correct . One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee . I guess there were n't any privates around.Good old Gammera was quite the sight though , walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged . That 's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship , whisking him off to Mars to save the world . High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save , now let 's get back to the Cold War.Like Godzilla , Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films , but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying , flaming turtles . Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has "" Attack of the Monsters "" with a featured guest appearance by the Big G. It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films ; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said ' Gammera , Sayonara ! """	0
"Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ , but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film , it`s more like a "" Man on the run "" film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases"	0
"The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint , he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever . Let 's forget that in order to become a saint , the saint must be dead , and saints do n't have significant others . That , for a millennium , Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred 's Scrooge is never even hinted at ! Open on Nick learning how to make toys , then on Fred learning how to run numbers ; Nick giving a sick child a dolly , Fred repossessing the dolly , along with the family farm !

"At first , I had n't read the novel so far and I had n't hear anything about the author yet . But as I casually saw this movie , I was totally captive by the story . Already as the Jewish watchman primary said , that he knows no one , who have a bad conscience about the war except from Howard W. Campbell Junior , was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war . Terrific ! And the fictitious story about "" the most effective spy for the USA in WWII "" , who have lost everything , that was important for his life , is wonderful emotional transcribed . This is the best story about the duality of humanity , I 've ever heard about ! The questions , this movie is introducing , are in my opinion very important for our society : When does someone bear the guilt of something ? What is guilt ? Who is a hero and who is a felon ? What is important in our life ? Can you live without paying attention to the political changes ? Is the protagonist guilty or not ? These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years . This is a must see for everyone , who have to think about the acception of war ! This movie is a must see for everyone , who meditate , what matters in life and what does n't ..."	1
I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one . Edward Furlong , you 're not as good as you think mate , you ca n't grab on every piece of low - cost amateur crap , which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.The filming is bad , and I mean BAD . Anyone with a camera would get the same result , or better.The acting , lets just say : do n't go to the supermarket looking for actors . The good ones usually come with a degree or , at least , have some damn experience ! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes , please find your purpose in life , as a director you simply suck . Your directing is poor , the angles are all messed up ( not in a good way ) , the lines seem as if they 're being read out of toilet paper , and the damn music .. it always comes up when it should n't and goes out for no apparent reason . And do n't go for writer either , by the way . Making movies is n't like serving on a coffeshop , it requires art and skill , things I really doubt you 'll ever have.Instead of making a badass shootout movie , you should 've shot this one back to oblivion and wait ' till something good came up .. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop . You 'll have less stress and you 'll save movie goers some money and a bad night.vote : 1/10 ( my first one )	0
"I recently saw the Broadway revival of "" Blithe Spirit "" starring Angela Lansbury , Rupert Everett , Christine Ebersole , and Jayne Atkinson . It 's a terrific production , and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect . Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati.It was probably a mistake , then , to check out the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison . The movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production.""Blithe Spirit "" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast , in an audience full of people who have come to laugh . The actors can improvise , give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines , and involve the audience on a personal level that you ca n't get in a movie house , or with a DVD showing , where the audience is separated from the story by the "" Fourth Wall . "" The story : Charles Condomine ( Rex Harrison ) , a successful writer , lives with his wife Ruth ( Constance Cummings ) in a house in the English countryside . Seeking information for his next book , a book dealing with the supernatural , Charles invites Madame Arcati ( Margaret Rutherford , reprising her role from the original 1941 London production ) , a local spiritual medium , over to his house to conduct a séance . Charles believes that spiritism is a sham , but hopes to pick up "" the tricks of the trade . "" But then Madame Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira ( Kaye Hammond ) , Charles 's first wife , who died of pneumonia seven years ago . Elvira refuses to leave , and develops a spitting rivalry with Ruth over Charles ( complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira).On stage , the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation . But on the screen , the actors in "" Blithe Spirit "" tear through the lines as if they do n't know that anyone is listening to them . They mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage . The performances by Harrison , Cummings , and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless . Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as Madame Arcati.The Oscar - winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today 's standards , but by the standards of 1946 ! They consist mostly of Kaye Hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup , being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.The cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting . But compare the dull visual effects of "" Blithe Spirit "" to the truly groundbreaking effects in Disney 's "" Song of the South "" -- which was eligible for awards the same year . In "" South , "" humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time . Compared to "" South , "" the Oscar that "" Blithe Spirit "" received for special effects was completely undeserved.At any rate , I can only encourage you to catch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury before it closes . As for the movie with Rex Harrison , skip it ."	0
Do not be mistaken , this is neither a horror , nor really a film . I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure ; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine.Nothing happens . You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist , a hint of surprise , a plot to emerge - but no.The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet do n't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful ( bring on the teen rock montage ) state . The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic ' companion'.Their encounters with obstacles ( be they human or physical ) are brief , confusing and entirely pointless.Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast . Lou Taylor Pucci could n't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert.Watch ' The Road ' , watch ' 28 days Later ' , watch day time TV ... anything but this ; I implore you . Suffer the boredom , unlike you may be led to believe in the film , this film is no cure .	0
"The late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies , what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery , the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times . While most of these were rip - roaring swashbucklers about the wild , superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power , Gunga Din is very different in its focus , scope and tone.Part of Gunga Din 's secret is the division of labour in its writing team . The original story is by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur , two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of Hollywood 's golden age . However the actual screenplay was the work of Joel Sayre and Fred Guiol , both of whom , Guiol especially , had a background in comedy . What we get from these four is a plot that is well - balanced and engaging , yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches . Most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies , usually featuring one or two comic - relief supporting players , but they did n't use laughs in the way Gunga Din does . Here , all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes . We see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light - hearted brawl . The first main battle scene is an even - handed blend of action and gags , in the style of the silent swashbucklers of Douglas Fairbanks , Sr . , something which the Flynn and Power vehicles largely failed to replicate . Towards the middle of Gunga Din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot . However the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this "" slow "" portion bearable.Producer - director George Stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing , himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios , and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point . This was his first full - on action feature , and he does a startlingly good job . In particular his use of moving point - of - view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating . He also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era  a sense of real dread and fear . He sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters . The portrayal of the abandoned village and the Thuggee cultists cry of "" Kali ! "" is genuinely haunting . This dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here , causing us to worry for these likable characters , and making the comedy a greater relief of tension.A real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience . We are made aware of Din visually , as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him . Because of this , we are given the impression that Din is not an important figure within the regiment , but he quickly becomes a notable character to us , and crucially a sympathetic one , as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men.But the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast . Fear not , for Gunga Din has a top - notch one ! Victor McLaglan and Cary Grant were ideally suited to the material , since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy . Grant in particular is at his best , largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over - the - top whooping and capering that was his trademark . Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions , but he is by no means bad . And of course there is Sam Jaffe , cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs , but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity ? I have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power , and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that I love absolutely . But Gunga Din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve . Not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel , it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy , in a way that few pictures have done before or since . And that 's fabulous ."	1
"This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer . The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes , but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed . Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence , drug abuse or juvenile delinquency ( or any other issue , for that matter).The main character 's metamorphosis from good , but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent , whereas the rape scene ( being an over - dragged , exaggerated version of the rape scene from "" A clockwork orange "" ) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values . There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his / her goal . At least in my opinion.To wrap it up : shockingly brutal , revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME . See "" A clockwork orange "" or "" Le pianiste "" instead ."	0
"This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad film - making may not "" open "" you up , to borrow one of the film 's favorite verbs , but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching . Based on the best - selling book by James Redfield , first ( self ) published in 1993 , this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher ( Matthew Settle ) who , on traveling to deepest , darkest , phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal . Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated , perhaps because they 're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir . Although there 's a lot of talk about "" energy , "" that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann , Annabeth Gish , Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow , all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon . For those who care , the plot involves the military , terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church ; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield , Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script . In short , easily the worst film seen in 40 + years of viewing movies ."	0
A funny comedy from beginning to end ! There are several hilarious scenes but it 's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me . Creative story line with a very talented cast . I thoroughly enjoyed it !	1
"Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines ( later of TV 's "" Flamingo Road "" ) as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the Gateway to Hell ! The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured , the mood music is perfect , Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina 's pal , but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone ( inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor ) , things really start cooking . The neighbors , including a fantastically wicked Burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo , are a diabolical lot , and Eli Wallach is great fun as a wily police detective . The movie is nearly a cross - pollination of "" Rosemary 's Baby "" and "" The Exorcist""--but what a combination ! Based on the best - seller by Jeffrey Konvitz , "" The Sentinel "" is entertainingly spooky , full of shocks brought off well by director Michael Winner , who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill . * * * 1/2 from * * * *"	1
"the movie opens with a beautiful lady in a tattered white gown running through a stereotypical eastern european town . we know she 's being followed by something , because she keeps looking behind her . and soon we see she 's being chased by a mysterious man in a black trenchcoat . then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her . but look is that her reflection in the store window ? ? ? no its just her identical twin vampire ! but unfortunately they both get it.after this brilliant and amazingly fun throwback to the old hammer films of the 60 's and 70 's ( in the credits the twins are listed as the twins of evil , which of course is the name of the final instalment in hammer 's karnstein trilogy ) , the plot pretty much dies.What little plot there is involves dracula ( who conveniently changes his appearance each time he is reborn , so the producer does n't have to rehire the same dracula ) coming to a morgue , the med students realizing he 's undead and thinking .... wow what an opportunity , maybe i 'll just disregard all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use the vampire 's blood to find a cure for our jerk friend 's ailment . obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire.A new concept but pulled off excruciatingly badly . The movie keeps setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them.For example the med students attempt to bring drac back to life by placing him in a bathtub filled with blood in a secluded run down country mansion . The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film , but do we stay there ? no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool . sigh . This movie has a real problem with "" homages "" as i mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of hammer , and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer - like movie , but the movie rapidly switches gears and changes to a medical horror.The other problem is that they introduce so many characters it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them . There are the med students and their wheelchair bound professor - type "" friend "" the med students are all : arrogant , boring , money hungry , and stupid . how they made it to med school at all amazes me , unless the med school had to meet its muscle bound hunk / big breast quota . and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie . hey i can respect that but it would be nice if they did n't set it up like the movie would be about him . then you have random priests , cops , and science types . so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that it becomes quickly tedious.Basically this is a lazy movie . no real scares , just a few predictable jump scares . The set up for these is so elaborate it is hilarious . for examp le the bathtub full of blood . it is so obvious that drac is going to pop out of the murky blood . and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable jump scare . after this he kills one of the dumber and larger breasted med students . we all know she 's going to become one of the undead . but what do the others do ? bury her in a shallow grave near the house . sigh , so you know who will jump out at you when the cops show up at the house .......... Oh well.Maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric , and then we will end up with an entire movie that is as good as the opening scene.<br / >"	0
"My Name is Modesty is a low - budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise . It 's not that the movie is terrible , it 's just not what I was expecting or hoping for . While I 've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years , I 'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels , so I 'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider . That may be part of the reason for my disappointment . I was expecting more action and more comedy . The film is dialogue driven . I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value . As it is , My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film . There are very few , if any , "" light "" moments . The acting , at least from Alexandra Staden , is acceptable but nothing outstanding . As others have commented , she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role . What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points . I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character . I 'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it ."	0
"I saw two movies over the weekend , One was "" kaal "" and the other "" Waqt "" . Both movies are made in "" Bollywood "" but they are worlds apart . The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director . Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "" Ankhen "" , one of the best Comedy Hindi movies . His Casting of the Charecteres is perfect . The story apparently taken from a Gujerati Play is awesome , the treatment is superb with some exceptions . In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy ( mediocre Malik in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract . So even a good Director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease the Finacier and the Grandma 's who just ca nt get enough of these numbers . No Music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie . None of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat - Natyam . The duelling and role playing the Father and Son is good acting by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar . His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding . A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie . Then we have a cheap classless tasteless Producer like Sharukh Khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like "" Kaal "" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of Art , and they surround themselves with borderline talent , and they recoup the investment before the word gets around . These are the Bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner "" Film Farce "" awards given by Bollywood Chamcha 's and most of them are in the Media ."	1
Good movie , very 70s , you can not expect much from a film like this , , Sirpa Lane is an actress of erotic films , a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears , but the ' 70s were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism . Not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today , the world has changed incredibly . The plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary . And the brunette actress has a single body , has one breast slightly bigger . Be satisfied . Papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... Download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them .	1
Well , finally got to see the remake last night in London , unintentionally hilarious , sexless and devoid of any real humour . I do n't really know where to start , whilst I was entertained by this strange homage , it did n't really move me . The acting is screamingly hammy , there is no original music , the costumes are far too ' Disney ' there is a ridiculous ' six months later ' insert after the burning of Nic Cage ( which did n't come soon enough for my liking ) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various ' baddies ' on the island . It 's such a weird remake that I ca nt quite believe I saw it , it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties , a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner 's Strike , very strange !	0
In the aftermath of Watergate , a number of conspiracy movies appeared , such as this one , written by the late Adam Kennedy ( based on his novel ) . < br />Gene Hackman plays ex - Vietnam veteran ' Roy Tucker ' , a loser who has wound up in prison . He receives visits from Marvin Tagge ( Richard Widmark ) , who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted . They offer him freedom , and despite distrusting Tagge he accepts . But he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of Spiventa ( Mickey Rooney ) . Exactly why is hard to see , as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker mad with persistent talk of sex , not what you want to hear when you are behind bars.Tagge 's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker 's astonished eyes . Reunited with wife Ellie ( Candice Bergen ) , and given a new identity ( strangely , he does not attempt to change his appearance . Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start ) , he settles down , but finds there is a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States . He refuses , so Tagge has Ellie abducted ... I will leave the synopsis here , but I am sure you can guess the rest for yourself . The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book ( neat trick that ! ) . The people Tagge represents are never revealed . The allusions to J.F.K. 's killing are unmistakable . Despite the findings of The Warren Commission , the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day.This was Stanley Kramer 's first movie in years , and while no turkey , it lacks the grip of say John Frankenheimer 's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' or Alan J.Pakula 's ' The Parallax View ' . Being a left - wing conspiracy movie , it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it . I prefer right - wing ones myself - they are funnier ! ' Domino ' has the look and feel of a made - for - T.V. movie , and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the Michael Caine classic ' Get Carter'.What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark . The latter , who sadly passed away earlier this year , is superb as the mysterious Tagge , who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated , beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall - just like dominoes . As Tucker , the innocent pawn , Hackman is marvellous . You have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place . In his shoes , I 'd have fled to the other side of the world , anywhere to get away from these fanatics . Hackman 's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down , and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched . Presumably the producers thought so too , which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film 's entire premise - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warning the audience that ' they ' are out there , and that ' they ' are out to get us . Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. show ' The Dawson Watch'.Mickey Rooney had earlier worked with Kramer on ' Its A Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ' . His ' death ' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture , with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead.Conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left , but now the right are getting in on the act too . Last year , ' Taking Liberties ' , an absurd concoction of lies and half - truths about Tony Blair 's Government turned out to be Britain 's answer to ' Reefer Madness ' . At least , ' Domino ' had lovely Candice Bergen . The best Chris Atkins ' film could offer was Anne Widdecombe!Surprisingly , ' The Domino Principle ' was made by Sir Lew Grade , the legendary British television mogul behind ' The Saint ' , ' Jesus Of Nazareth ' and ' The Muppet Show ' . He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on ' Raise The Titanic ! ' , whose failure was so great it sank Grade 's ambitions of being the new Louis B.Meyer . Being somewhat open - minded , I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy .	1
Cosimo ( Luis Guzmán ) is told in prison about a perfect heist . Since he 's behind bars and ca n't do it himself he has to leave it to his girl Rosalind ( Patricia Clarkson).Soon there are five guys organizing the crime- five guys with very little brain capacity . Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood ( 2002).It 's a crime comedy that 's often very funny . You ca n't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys . There are some great actors playing these characters . William H.Macy plays Riley . Isaiah Washington is Leon . Sam Rockwell is Pero . Michael Jeter is Toto . Andy Davoli is Basil . Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle . Jennifer Esposito plays Pero 's love interest Carmela . George Clooney ( also producer ) plays Jerzy , the tattooed guy in a wheelchair . This is a highly entertaining flick . I certainly recommend it .	1
He - he - hello ! ! This is a really fun movie . Basically , in Party Girl , you have your fun - lovin ' , independent , early 90 's New Yorker chick . Along with her party friends , she meets a mature Turkish Vendor . It is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do . It is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman . Hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties.On a side note , Parker Posey makes this movie great . I have never been a great fan of her , but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies . There are subtle manerisms that perfected her character . If you want good laughs and a fun time , make sure to watch this movie . Repeated viewings are a must .	1
I will admit that I did not give this movie much of a chance . I decided pretty early on that this just was n't my kind of movie.For the most part , it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography . The scenes of early 70 's Manhattan look very good , as does the lead actress . It is a very crisp black and white , which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh . However , some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell . The disjointed editing is VERY late-60 's , somewhere between surrealism and new wave . The story also feels like it came from a very specific time , somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with . As she meets other odd characters , she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs . The movie seems to be meant as an off - the - wall , irreverent comedy , but adds an avant - garde feel . I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies , you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book.Some problems I had : Near the end of the movie , one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes-brutal to sit through . Also , there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and juvenile that serves as the film 's climax . I did laugh out loud four or five times , and I liked the ending ( minus the flat - out disgusting animation ) . And when the film switched to color for the final phone - booth - at - night sequence , I actually liked the way it looked even better . It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt like I could have really liked it if it been a little different . But this is what the filmmakers gave us . It is obscure , artsy , and way left of the dial , but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own . I did n't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious .	0
Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror , diamonds are crafted , and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance . This is no less than a diamond ! ! This is a film brimful of eeriness , chilling anticipation , and dark atmosphere , and I think it 's safe to say , one of my favourite horror films of all time ! And of course it contains probably the single most , flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror ! Every time I see the film , and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen , I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits , but it never fails to happen ; I never get it right , and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it ! ! Now , it must be said , to scare a jaded horror fan like that , that is nothing short of pure perfection . Unlike the Americans , the Brits know their subtleties , they take pride in the art of acting , they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere , they rely on the power of the potent story , and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation . Every single element is impeccable , from the set pieces , the acting , the story , to the menacing atmosphere . Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper , that 's for sure ! ! As an end note , if you for some demented reason do n't like this piece of insanity , then you honestly do n't know what horror is all about , and frankly do not deserve to know it either . Thank you !	1
"Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child . At the adoption agency they meet a mouse ( Stuart ) and they decide to adopt him . If you think that this is stupid , hold it , because it 's getting worse.Stuart arrives to his new home , where he is treated like a human child . ( Spare me ! ) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché , about family problems , jealousy from the elder "" brother "" , and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a "" happy family "" . Boring and worn out as this is , it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.I do n't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché , or he was just trying to fill in minutes , but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrent.Then why I gave a 3 and not a ZERO ? Because of the family cat , who loves Stuart as much as the "" brother "" . And because of some funny gigs , where Stuart makes good use of his small size.On the overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if : a. Stuart was a PET and not a "" sibling "" . b. It had kept to the funny gigs , like Stuart trying to outwit the cat , and had left out boring clichés which do n't even match with anything else ."	0
This movie promised bat people . It did n't deliver . There was a guy who got bit by a bat , but what was with the seizures ? And the stupid transformation ? Where was the plot ? Where was the acting ? Who came up with the idea to make this ? Why was it allowed to be made ? Why ? Why ? I guess we 'll never know .	0
Lars Von Trier is never backward in trying out new techniques . Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey . With so many cities lying in ruins , Leo Kessler a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration . It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.His uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa Railway Line . His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers . When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles . A terrible argument ensues when a passenger 's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished . There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.The railway journey is like an allegory representing man 's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations . In one sequence Leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half - starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from Auschwitz . These images , horrible as they are , are fleeting as in a dream , each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.At a station called Urmitz Leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb . In view of many by - standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage . He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock . Later he jumps from the train ( at high speed ) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank . Looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy . Subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock . If you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task . Quite ridiculous in fact . It could only happen in a dream.It 's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed , I prefer Lars Von Trier 's later films ( Breaking the Waves and The Idiots ) . The bomb scene described above really put me off . Perhaps I 'm a realist .	1
"Thre is n't a single Scorsese movie I 'd place on a list of my favorite movies . But this is the best thing I 've run through my DVD player in about five years . Scorsese 's patient elucidation of favorite film moments , and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious , calm and intelligent . < br />It 's 3 DVD - sides worth of material . It would have to be a British production , since everything about American corporate culture would have trampled the quiet , methodical , no frills , put - the - focus - on - the - content approach that is taken here . And an American production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites . I wish everyone took a page from his love of movies . You should love the movies you do for personal , idiosyncratic and specific reasons . Not just more "" Me - too "" votes for The Godfather , etc .. People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies . If they did , movies would be more interesting than they are . Scorsese DOES know what ideas are being explored , and that makes him a compelling , involved speaker on the topic . I really appreciate his articulate , generous interviews over the last decade.On a negative note , Scorsese is best when he 's excited to show you some obscure movie , rather than when he 's didactically teaching you something well - established about film history . And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose . It 's very distracting ."	1
Peter Sellers ( one of my favorite actors ) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey , but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn 's youth ( just after her Oscar win ) can not begin to pull this one out of the mud . As a skirt - chasing celeb in his 40 's , Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.A 3 out of 10 . Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well , because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 ( a very good year for films - CATCH-22 , M.A.S.H. , HUSBANDS , JOE , WUSA , FIVE EASY PIECES and many others ) . You ca n't win them all !	0
If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation ... oh well .. but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic , you will love it .. Jim Carey was incredible as usual . The story line was great , a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better . Ron Howard never misses a beat .. But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added , this is supped to be a kids or family show . Try not to lose sight of that .. if you do you really wo nt enjoy the movie ... and as for the comments about Ron Howard , try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do .. its not easy as it looks ...	1
"The comment by "" eliz7212 - 1 "" hits the proverbial "" nail on the head "" for this turkey of a program . But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner "" cavort "" and "" dance "" ( yes , the "" "" marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does ) . This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing , or so , to see Shatner , who seems to have taken "" camp "" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself . But the guy is funny.The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls , will be pretty much out - of - luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey - a - go - go genre , with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.I watched the first contestant , who was annoying , and literally "" dumber than a : post , "" yet through sheer luck , walked away with a quarter mil or so . The second contestant , somewhat more intelligent , but who 'd be lucky to gain $ 1,000 on Jeopardy ! , got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he did n't know , and thereby left with zilch.This plethora of game shows , which dangle , and sometimes award , large sums to everyday individuals , are admittedly a cheap effort , overall , to attempt to woo viewers . Even if the host is well - compensated , and they give away six figures in an average episode , I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you do n't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures , per episode , with some big residual deals as well.But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long . This one has already pretty much reached this point . I think his offerings , especially with James Spader , and the others on "" Boston Legal "" should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner 's offerings.Again , the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance , perhaps one time ; that should be sufficient ."	0
"Without "" mental anachronism "" , this film which I would like to find in DVD offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the "" disenchantment of the world "" .

"My scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when I vowed I love this film . Bring on the coals ; I 'll walk over them as well to say again that I love "" Bend it Like Beckham . "" Granted , there 's a lot of "" in spite of "" in that confession . It 's a bit movie - of - the - week ; the screenplay is on the paint - by - numbers side . And , most troublingly , the director 's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.The film 's genius is not in what 's obvious to the Syd Field - doctored eye : character arcs , themes , construction . It 's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath , but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at . Powerful , sometimes semi - clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do . These are real bodies ( Keira Knightley 's excepted ) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later . They are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self - determination . And , in my book , lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective , "" luminous , "" but because her performance has an honesty and un - bookish intelligence that 's utterly compelling.The result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they 're making a pact with the devil to do so . As in Chadha 's "" Bride and Prejudice , "" the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that ca n't be neatly slotted into the stodgy , Sweet Valley High categories of "" best friends "" or "" sisters . "" Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film 's flirtation with lesbianism . "" Bend it Like Beckham "" has an electricity that ca n't be reduced to the simple hetero / homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest . The precise nature of its pleasure is , ultimately , a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it.Oh yes , and did I mention that it 's hilarious ?"	1
Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of a doubt , one of the most amazing shows ever produced , but not just in the field of animation . While the first part ( Acts 1 and 2 ) mostly consists of action and fun , the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second Part ( Acts-3 and 4 ) . I do have some complaints though . In the first part , the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . One might also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool . Buaku rules .	1
"Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife ( who produced it ) took a Q&A afterwards.I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso , it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba . However , do n't expect this to be a movie about the revolution , it 's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous . Many references to the directors obvious love of film history ( a great "" Bicycle Thief "" homage "" ) and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.Enjoy !"	1
Breaking Glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once . It is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible . Looking at some of today 's ' search for a star ' style TV shows on both in the UK and abroad I am always reminded of this film . Though not an expert on the subject , the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there . This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same . After getting rid of her manager , played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels , slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out . You potential stars of tomorrow .... WATCH THIS AND BEWARE ! ! !	1
This unpleasant film has little to recommend it . Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed . And there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.But no . Motivations are either murky or trite . Most of the acting is sub - par . The script creates needless confusion . And the director 's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.It 's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film .	0
Simply great movie no doubt about it . Great story and superb performances , be it Amitabh , Akshay , Shefali , Priyanka , Boman or Rajpal . Hindi film industry is going shameless with Mallika and Co , this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our Indian society . But the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb . Anu Malik(boring copy - cat ) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as musician . I think Vipul Shah should have given little bit Gujarati touch particularly in music also . Anu Malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required - He looks only good with Govinda style songs . I felt some nice serious music with couple of good Ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable .	1
As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years , whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions , it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other . That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge , merchant and money lender in 19th century London.As his nephew points out to his uncle , he does n't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug . The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago , he 's a hard case , a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart , Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls , New York.But as Charles Dickens told this tale , redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how.A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was . The characters in this film are middle and lower class . The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist , but they are having to struggle to stay up there . Still love and happiness radiate their home , no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for . < br />Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much , Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge . But George C. Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film . The meanness of him , but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change . Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who 've both done great interpretations of Scrooge.Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present . < br />According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best .	1
"Radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when I grew up in the 1930s England , so Children 's Hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power . The few programmes I heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind , and the 3 that I recall still are "" Toytown "" , one about all the animals at the Zoo , and --- Grey Owl , talking about the animals he knew , which he called his "" brothers "" . It was only in recently that I learnt that Grey Owl was n't a genuine "" Indian "" , but the tribute paid by the Sioux Chief makes great sense to me "" A man becomes what he dreams "" . Would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as Archie Grey Owl Belaney . Would that a new Grey Owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment ."	1
One of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Acting was terrible , both for the kids and the adults . Most to all characters showed no , little or not enough emotion . The lighting was terrible , and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot ( In the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed , there 's 4 shots ; The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat , Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming , the rest of the kids in the daytime * when it 's supposed to in the evening * at the river bank , and the doctor , Beatrice , and Simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat . ) The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff , Cappy ( Although , there 's a slip of character when the pulse detector * Whatever that thing is when people die , it beeps * shows Cappy has died , he still moves while it can still be heard beeping , and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually , then it shows the pulse again , and THEN he finally dies . ) I guess it 's not going to be perfect , since it 's an independent movie , but it still could be better . Not worth watching , honestly , even for kids . Might as well watch something good , like The Lion King or Toy Story if you 're going to see anything you 'll remember .	0
"I only hope that no classicists / ancient historians saw "" Cleopatra "" , or , if they did , that they took it as a laugh . The movie is horrendously inaccurate , more laughably , even , than "" Gladiator "" ( which is at least a well - written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story ) . Most blatant is Octavius , Caesar 's heir , in the Senate before Caesar 's assassination : at the ripe old age of 19!Besides this , the acting is mediocre . Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says , "" Caesar . Julius Caesar . "" Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony . And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive Pharaoh ( who in real life was not good - looking at all ) but comes off as unbelievable.So this is a warning for all historians -- this movie is not true to life !"	0
"This movie has always been my favorit Disney movie . Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th aniversy of this movie DVD . WOW I remembered why I loved this movie . The DVD is So great , It has an extra 30 min that the original did not have . I did not know this when I first started watching . The movie made ever so much more since . The music they cut out should have been left in . You have not seen this movie until you have seen the Full 131 min version . A lot of people say that the music is forgettable . I remember every song in this movie by heart , every song has it 's own Charm by it 's self , and comes together as a hole . I remember when i was younger I had the "" Eglantine "" song stuck in my head for days at a time .

"Really it 's a dreadful cheat of a film . Its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage . The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes . The plot exposition is very poorly rendered . They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together . There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors . Please do n't ask.The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth . It 's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built H - bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour . Nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by then.What saves this film , somewhat uniquely , IS the stock footage . I 've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film . This is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft I managed to see . There 's a brief interception by a pilot flying , in alternate shots , an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86 . First to scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Sabre Jets ( or Canadian built CF-13s ) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks.Then for some reason there are B-52s , B-47s and even B36s are seen taking off . More padding.""These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour "" . I do n't think so since one of them appears to be a WW2 era Gloster Meteor , the rest F-80s . The Meteors press the attack and one turns into a late F-84F with a flight of early straight wing F-84s attacking in formation.There 's a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that does n't seem to be the T-33 training type but some sort of interim all - weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose . These are scrambled in a snowstorm.An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters . It launches F-8U Crusaders , F-11F Tigers , A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors . The Air Force scrambles F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s then you 've ever seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Sabres and F-102 Delta Daggers.The F-100s press their attack with sooooo much padding . The F-89 's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo . The F-86s fire , an F-102 lets loose a Falcon , even some F-80s ( F-94s ? ) with mid - wing rocket pods let loose . There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 ( prototype ? ) with a straight wing early model F-85 above it in a turn , obviously a manufacturer 's ( Republic Aviation ) advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet . How it strayed into here is anybodies guess.There is other great stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of New York City 's Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills in the early 50s . < br />I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background . The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat mind - boggling and there is a nice TR 3 to be seen also . Canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background.As far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture . And she most definitely is flipping someone off . Could it be , R as in Robert Loggia ? The director who dies before this film was released ? Her career as this was her last credit?Its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift ."	0
One of the best movies out there . Yeah maybe the cinematography was n't the greatest , but an excellent plot and concept . Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas . Something different from the usual movies and great fun . One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies . Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots , the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while . The sets are not amazing , but simple and worked for the overall look of the film . This movie is very hard to find on DVD , but also on VHS . Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out . Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you 've ever seen . Take a look and think like a child . It 's a great view and very fun .	1
""" The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail "" has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie . The story is standard giallo . When a man dies in a plane crash his wife ( Ida Galli ) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy . The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her . There are plenty of suspects , including a tenacious investigator ( George Hilton ) from the insurance agency and the widow 's lover . Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer . Anita Strindberg ( also memorable in "" Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key "" and "" Who Saw Her Die ? "" ) is a stunning - looking heroine . It 's one of Martino 's best films ."	1
"Blood Castle ( aka Scream of the Demon Lover , Altar of Blood , Ivanna -- the best , but least exploitation cinema - sounding title , and so on ) is a very traditional Gothic Romance film . That means that it has big , creepy castles , a headstrong young woman , a mysterious older man , hints of horror and the supernatural , and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term . It also means that it is very deliberately paced , and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement . If you love films like Robert Wise 's The Haunting ( 1963 ) , but you also have a taste for late 1960s / early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror , you may love Blood Castle , as well.Baron Janos Dalmar ( Carlos Quiney ) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional , unspecified European village . The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman , she soon after ends up dead -- the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them . This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women . At the beginning of the film , yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated.Meanwhile , Dr. Ivanna Rakowsky ( Erna Schürer ) has appeared in the center of the village , asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar 's castle . She 's an out - of - towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry . Of course , no one wants to go near the castle . Finally , Ivanna finds a shady individual ( who becomes even shadier ) to take her . Once there , an odd woman who lives in the castle , Olga ( Cristiana Galloni ) , rejects Ivanna and says that she should n't be there since she 's a woman . Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay . She ends up staying , but somewhat reluctantly . The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns , which the Baron 's brother , Igor , is suffering from.Unfortunately , the Baron 's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre , blackish liquid . And furthermore , Ivanna is having bizarre , hallucinatory dreams . Just what is going on at the castle ? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes ? Is he insane ? < br />I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did . As I mentioned , the film is very deliberate in its pacing , and most of it is very understated . I can go either way on material like that . I do n't care for The Haunting ( yes , I 'm in a very small minority there ) , but I 'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror . One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava . I also love Dario Argento 's work from that period . But occasionally , Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times . There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle.But the atmosphere of the film is decent . Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations , and they 're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola . However , Blood Castle feels relatively low budget , and this is a Roger Corman - produced film , after all ( which usually means a low - budget , though often surprisingly high quality "" quickie "" ) . So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava 's colors and complex set decoration , everything is much more minimalist . Of course , it does n't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that 's been left out in the sun too long . It appears "" washed out "" , with compromised contrast.Still , Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals . For example , a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that 's shot from an exaggerated angle , and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only . There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots , where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships , besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame.The performances are fairly good , and the women -- especially Schürer -- are very attractive . Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity . Schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres , with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman 's Prison ( 1974 ) , Naked and Lustful ( 1974 ) , Strip Nude for Your Killer ( 1975 ) and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer ( 1977 ) . Blood Castle is much tamer , but in addition to the nudity , there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage , and of course the scenes mixing sex and death.The primary attraction here , though , is probably the story , which is much a slow - burning romance as anything else . The horror elements , the mystery elements , and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses , but in the end , Blood Castle is a love story , about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms ( often with physical threats or harms ) to be together ."	1
What a great actor to have in such an awful story ... The film and its production , however , is quite good , even though set in London but with exteriors in Bristol . No matter  see one cathedral , you 've seen 'em all , sort of.The story however ... is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything , should he so wish . With just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis , the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy , a teenager and finally as a man ; so much so , in fact , that he exacts vengeance at will , literally . Over time , he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it!The trouble with the narrative , however , is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi - religious claptrap to produce a hodge - podge theory about it all . Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and I 'm afraid Richard Burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing . His very best scene , however , is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home : sharp , witty and deadly dialog , delivered as only Burton could.A good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better , though , beginning with Lino Ventura , whom I last saw in Garde A Vu ( 1981 ) , as Inspector Brunel ; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner ; the much under - rated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld ; Derek Jacobi as a publisher , Towney , and a few other well known character actors.I liked the way the story was presented , as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar ( Richard Burton ) , the writer with the killer disposition . Up till that point , it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick . Still , it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would - be murderer.Then , they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes . If you want a clue about what that is , think Samson and Delilah ( 1949 ) , from the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille , and how Samson got the bad guys in the end . And , the very last scene is just plain stupid . Why ? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar 's rampaging could have been stopped , absolutely.Shame , actually , because this could have been a lot better story and movie . I guess Burton really needed the money.If you 're Burton fan , then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above . Otherwise , do n't bother .	0
This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . Ever . But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD 's at my local pound shop . Me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . It soon occurred that this was n't any normal film . Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill 's last film . At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no - one could be bothered . Instead we watched the film right through . At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this was n't a work of abysmal film . This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . This was a film that anyone can enjoy . This was genius .	1
"Without wishing to be a killjoy , Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i 've ever seen - this being one of them , and Camp Blood being another . < br />The acting is terrible , the print is shoddy , and everything about this film screams "" seriously , you could do better yourself "" . Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?I bought this for £ 1 , but remember , you ca n't put a price on 71 minutes of your life . You 'd do well to avoid this turkey , even at a bargain basement price ."	0
Kudos to Fawcett to taking on roles that , at the time were considered controversial . To my recollection , rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980 's , and women 's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time.Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed , then stalked by actor James Russo . He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath , but at times a bit transparent.Diana Scarwid has a bit role , as does Alfre Woodard as the house mate . Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett , the rape victim , takes revenge on the culprit . The scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at Russo is classic , and as the rapist he deserves it . She then keeps him in bondage , and the consequences must be faced.A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated , physically , and mentally . Highly recommended . 8/10 .	1
"After not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th Century , in 1908 playwright D.W. Griffith got the job that would make him a legend : he was hired by the Biograph Company as a director of movies . It was n't really what Griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business , but he accepted the job , and in less than a year he became Biograph 's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film - making and the wild inventive of his narrative . Many years later , he would direct "" The Birth of a Nation "" in 1915 , the movie that would revolutionize film - making and make him one of cinema 's first recognized authors ; however , a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for Biograph Company in the early years of his career . 1909 's "" The Sealed Room "" is one of those , and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th Century.""The Sealed Room "" is a story set in the 16th Century in which a Count ( Arhtur V. Johnson ) has built a windowless room in his castle . It is a small yet nice and very cozy room , as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife , the Countess ( Marion Leonard ) in a more private way . However , the Count does n't know that his wife is not exactly faithful , as she is infatuated with the Minstrel ( Henry B. Walthall ) at Court , with whom she is having an affair . As soon as the Count gets busy with his own business , the Countess calls the Minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the Count 's new room . When the Count returns , he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect , finally discovering the two lovers in his room ; but instead of making a scene , he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife : to seal the windowless room with the couple inside.Written by Griffiths ' regular collaborator Frank E. Woods , "" The Sealed Room "" takes elements from Edgar Allan Poe 's "" The Cask of Amontillado "" and mainly Honoré De Balzac 's "" La Grande Breteche "" to create a haunting Gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism . Despite having a runtime of 11 minutes , Woods ' screenplay develops the story in a very good way , and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story . While a melodrama at heart , Woods focus on the character of the Count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era . "" The Sealed Room "" is definitely a very simple and basic story , but Woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most Griffith 's melodramas.In "" The Sealed Room "" , Griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual . While he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience , in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror , playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had . It is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot , culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes . Not being a movie where camera tricks are essential , what shines the most in "" The Sealed Room "" is Griffith 's talent to direct his actors , as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day.As usual , the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of Griffith , starting with Arthur V. Johnson as the Count . Johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character 's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster . His performance is not without a touch of overacting , but actually that adds realism to the character 's exaggerated personality . As the Countess , Marion Leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting , conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery . Finally , the legendary Henry B. Walthall appears as the handsome Minstrel , and while far from being one of his best performances , he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film . While not of real importance to the plot , it 's nice to see other members of Griffith 's stock company in the background , like his wife Linda Arvidson and a young Mary Pickford as nobles at Court.While not exactly a masterpiece , "" The Sealed Room "" is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like Griffith used to do in those days . The movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget , Griffith 's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style . The change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era , and Johnson 's performance as the sadistic Count makes it worth a watch . While Griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential ( and controversial ) "" The Birth of a Nation "" , the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend . Simple yet elegant , "" The Sealed Room "" is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th Century . 7/10"	1
"First of all I 've got to give it to the people that got this thing together . 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts . It 's a shame , although not surprising , that the movie was banned in the US.That being said I think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments . The movie starts up with the Iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majidi 's work ( the absolutely beautiful "" heaven 's children "" and "" the color of paradise "" ) . Much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afgan refugees in Iran . Absolutely beautiful clip . Same goes for Sean Penn 's clip which is superb as well . But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal . Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut - wrenching "" Amores perros "" he does it as brutal as he can . Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background . Those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes , those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families , those who were angry .... and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers . A very hard clip to watch and one that you wo n't forget.Some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for Americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as "" you 're not the only ones that are suffering "" . In particular the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US has caused to other people.I will also make a special mention to the clips from Bosnia - Herzegovina , France , India and Japan ( although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't).However , not all the clips are great and I make a special mention on the clip from Israel which , in my opinion , is extremely weak . While the idea was good ( a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in New York is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to ) the realization is terrible . The clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air - time at all costs , a guy saying he 's a witness and hoping that he can go on TV , and soldiers and paramedics shouting just "" because "" . The clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation.If you happen to have the chance to see it then you should , that is , unless you 're a conservative in which case you 'd better stay out as you might get offended . But if you 're not then you might learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11 ."	1
"I have seen this movie many times , ( and recently read the book the movie is based on ) and every time I see it , I just want to slap all four of them . The fact that they do n't clue in to the fact that Tom Hank 's character is flipping into his D&D(oops M&M ) :) persona ( "" Oh , he 's just acting in character . "" ) outside of the gaming session . That and the fact that after three months of therapy , let 's just destroy all that and feed his delusions ! These kind of people are what give RPGs a bad name.Also the corny ' love ballad ' , and the music done by ' cat on a piano ' and ' stop us if we get too annoying ' are almost enough to set your teeth on edge !"	0
Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be ' comedy ' . That is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for . After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama , Hera Pheri and Hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I ca n't recollect for now . Now with hideous films like Dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- ' torture'.Dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy . The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent . < br />Speaking of the acting , I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top ( if you compare them with the others in the movie ) , then came Tusshar Kapoor , then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above . The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting . The grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.The plot was the same , seen before one . Four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists . There is a ' bad ' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb . And at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine . The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.The worst thing about the movie is its length . After an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater . But being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie . THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.If your mother - in - law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun . 3 out of 10 .	0
"I did n't really expect much from "" The Night Listener "" and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover in the videostore . However , the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension . On occasion it drags a little , but it actually helps to keep you wondering what 's going to happen and more importantly : when . As the movie progresses , the character played by Robin Williams gets dragged into some kind of "" cat and mouse "" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no - one seemed to have ever seen in person . The Night Listener is an interesting story , which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you 're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what 's real . However , in the end it kind of disappoints and does n't live up to the potential it could have had . It does n't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character , which would have been helpful and interesting ."	0
The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche 's work and personality , psychoanalytical techniques and Vienna 's history . Take a well - know genius you have not read , describe him as demented , include crazy physicians to cure him , a couple of somewhat good looking women , have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache , have every character speak with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams , include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one ( Freud ) , mention a few words used in the genius ' works , overdo everything you can , particularly music , and you are done .

A best - selling book about honour killings in Jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after allegations surface that the story has been fabricated ; associated with other allegations of its author 's past as a con - woman . A few years later , she resurfaces , conceding that she took a certain amount of dramatic licence but willing to cooperate with a film - maker to prove the substance of her allegations . What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality , someone who 's behaviour on one had makes no sense unless what she is saying is true , yet who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but unproven at best and most often , verifiably false . It 's almost impossible to imagine what Ms. Khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film : vindication ? celebrity ? - all she does achieve is to project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual , and even that can not be taken at face value . Director Anna Broinowski appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses , and increasingly exasperated to boot ; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable , although scary and disturbing , tale to tell - and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in .	1
I 'll be honest with y all , I was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on ABC I did n't think I would like it at all . But with John Ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it , plus their was something else with it I liked . The acting was great , not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines , John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy . This was a great show to watch , and I 'll tell you why it was a great show . My father who never watches sitcoms at all , he just watches movies , sports , and law & order , he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters , my mother , and myself , and watched the show I think because John Ritter was in it . I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rest his soul i wish he had n't passed away .	1
"I wonder who , how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years ? He 's an Academy Award winning director . Yes , he won for Ghandi you moron ! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa ? He has experience with musicals . Really ? "" Oh what a lovely war "" have you forgotten ? To answer your question , yes ! The film is a disappointment , clear and simple . Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings . Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical . I felt nothing . But when I saw it on stage I felt everything . The film should have been cast with stars , unknown , newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group . Great actors who could dance beautifully . Well Michael Douglas was in it . True I forgot I 'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right . Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical ."	0
"The first point that calls the attention in "" For Ever Mozart "" is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb . The explanation is simple since there is no story , screenplay , plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie . Jean - Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films . I believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about ; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie , and it is funny to read their reviews . < br />My vote is one.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Para Sempre Mozart "" ( "" Forever Mozart "" )"	0
First week of May , every year brings back the memories of the holocaust , through movies on televisions . Among many movies they showed , this was the one I had not seen.The story is about Hilter 's life and how he came to power . It starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in Germany.The movie was earlier presented as a TV series and later converted into a movie format . Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great guts , conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man.It is a good screenplay and narrative , that educates the audiences on the main events that lead Hitler into power , and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of Hitler . The movie is a biased viewpoint of the director Christian Duguay  who shows Hitler as a one - track , menacing , angry , and shouting person  who had such a strong hold on the Germans and people around him . Hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction , and there the movie fails to convince Hitler 's portrayal.Even though the venture was for TV , all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie . The production value , sets , costumes , etc . were perfect.There is a lot of criticism of this movie , in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented . But still the movie is gripping , every engaging and entertaining . Robert Carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does . He is amazingly good  brilliant ! I would have liked a more balanced view of Hitler 's life , because I think , Hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of Germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust . As I have told several times , that  very sadly - our society loves to garland or prosecute one person , as a representative of the society 's good or evil respectively .	1
This was n't what i wanted to see . I bought this on DVD and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment.Heres what i did n't like:1 They were shooting at the father < br />2 The tribes was really annoying < br />3 the dinosaurs ( mostly)looked to faked < br />4 The bad scientist well he was annoying < br />5 The picture quality on the DVD was really bad < br />What i DID like : < br />1 The music by Jerry Goldsmith . This music is really great . I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie . Sadly the sound quality is not good , but its OK for its time.2 The first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe.3 Baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing < br />4 That funny scene with the tent . < br />5 The children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses .	0
Steven Speilberg 's adaptation of Alice Walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy . When first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men , while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black women.This is the story of a young black woman named Celie , growing up in rural America after the turn of the century . She has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth . Her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sister.Celie ( played in later years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg ) is married off to an abusive husband ( Danny Glover ) . The husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie 's life.The story is often heartbreaking as Celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children . Throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters , including Sophia , a tough as nails wife to her step son , and Shug , a loud and luscious saloon singer , who teaches her a thing or two about love.Speilberg 's direction is all over this picture , which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances . I dare you to watch this film and not be moved ! The film The Color Purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story . While it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the African story , both of which were so vivid in the book , the movie remains true to its themes , allowing the voice of Alice Walker to shine through.I could n't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film . Suffice it to say , however , this is one of the few films that I can watch again and again , and which has left an indelible mark on me.<br / >	1
I did not really want to watch this one . It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I do n't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker . The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film . I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale . So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle . And to my complete shock , Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero ! He is the one who romances the young Divya ! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too , only in the second part of this idiotic film.Just let me repeat the question : why would a 17 year - old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired , chubby , swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor ? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part ; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself . He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse -- acts like a teenager at his forties . On top of that , just to make himself more pathetic , he plays a pop - star ... To make things clear , I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are . As long as they make a convincing couple , there should be no problem . In fact , leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls ( Amitabh Bachchan - Sridevi , Mithun Chakraborty - Madhuri Dixit , Shahrukh Khan - Deepika , Salman Khan - Sneha Ullal ) and made the pairing pretty well . Also , I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor , I think he is a good actor , and his act in Bobby is still well - engraved in my heart , but it 's not that he looks in this film like , say , Shahrukh Khan , Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.That was such a disappointment . Oh , and as for the reason every person actually watched this film , Shahrukh Khan made a good debut . He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do . The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well . If you want to watch this film , go for the second half only . Personally , I would not do even that .	0
"The Broadway musical , "" A Chorus Line "" is arguably the best musical in theatre . It 's about the experiences of people who live for dance ; the joys they experience , and the sacrifices they make . Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line , yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite . < br />The film version , though , captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show , and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical , as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance , whatsoever . < br />The biggest mistake was made in giving the director 's job to Sir Richard Attenborough , whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for "" Gandhi . "" Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?Which brings us to the next problem . "" A Chorus Line "" takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . It 's the least flashy of Broadway musicals , and its simplicity was its glory . However , that does n't translate well to film , and no one really thought that it would . For that reason , the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers , and should have left the theatre and audition process . The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet , jazz or tap class . Heck , they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations . Yet , not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film , as Attenborough 's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director ( Michael Douglas ) whether he wants to hear them or not . Douglas ' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear , and to whom he has no patience . < br />While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play , some heretical changes were made . The very beautiful "" Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen , Hello Love""--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence -- was removed and replaced with the dreadful , "" Surprise , "" a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar . Adding insult to injury , "" Surprise "" simply retold the same story as "" Hello , Love "" but without the wit or pathos.There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film . If you want to see a film version of this show , the next closest thing is Bob Fosse 's brilliant "" All That Jazz . "" While Fosse 's daughter is in "" A Chorus Line , "" HE is the Fosse who should have been involved , as director . He would have known what to do with this material , which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort ."	0
Jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts - one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget / box office ones . It 's a mere 70 minutes and does n't feature many sets , and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck . But what a star , of course . < br />Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert . The majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor , who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help . Some psychological battling there . < br />It 's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it taut , and that Stanwyck is great should go without mention ( but I 'll still praise her every time ) .	1

"I can not get past the message of this movie . It 's laid out much too clearly to ignore , and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it 's about . I have n't read the novel , but Pollack 's film opens with a scene at a CIA - front organization in New York , which is broken into by two professional assassins , headed by Max von Sydow , who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we 've come to know and understand . The staff include an elderly female receptionist , a fussy elderly professorial guy who 's toupee falls off when he is machine - gunned ( is that a joke ? ) , and , last , the beautiful Tina Chen who looks up from the copier , realizes she is about to be murdered , and says , pitifully brave , "" I wo n't scream . "" Von Sydow replies sympathetically , "" I know . "" These murders are completely unexpected , savage , unmotivated by anything that we are aware of , and graphic . It is a brutal scene . < br />There is absolutely no way in which von Sydow and his henchman can be redeemed . And yet that is exactly what Pollack tries to do towards the end.After having killed these innocent good guys , von Sydow switches sides ( because the other side is willing to pay him ) and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural CIA plot . The script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable , sensitive human being . "" It is better to live in Europe . Things are not so rushed . "" Or whatever . I swear I 'm not making this up . Pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat . That 's the message . You should write it down in case you forget . Just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values , not to mention common sense , upside - down like that ? I understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the United States , even hate it , and who see conspiracies just about everywhere , providing a knee - jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events . I know that people who think this way exist because I number some of them among my closer friends . Nevertheless , at some point this dislike , this hatred , if it increases in intensity , must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric . I do n't for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official . I do n't care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the Louvre on the Metro . Whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation.I'd like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message , but I ca n't . It 's quite well done . ( In some ways that 's worse , because it makes the film less dismissable . ) Even New York City looks photogenic on the screen . And it 's been a long time since I 've thought of New York as photogenic . Robert Redford does an admirable job of projecting his character 's initial shock and confusion , but then turns into a telecommunicational semi - genius . And , man , he looks just fine ! His wardrobe is just right . Even his rimless glasses are becoming . And his peacoat . It 's not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous . He seems extremely handsome too , the swine . I want to look like that . I want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache . Faye Dunaway is alright in her role but it 's not too believable a role . Would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint ? Even if he did look like Redford ? Would anyone be emotionally wounded if , when this ambivalent relationship is about to end , Redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened ? Cliff Robertson is surprisingly good . He does one or two extremely good double - takes . The mailman is superb . The fight between him and Redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and , for once , we really do n't know for sure how it will turn out , because Redford ( a book reader after all ) seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin . This is one of John Housemann 's final roles . A shame . He 's a magnet on screen . And what an end to his life : a friend finds him lost , wandering the streets of New York , in a neighborhood he 'd been familiar with for most of his life . < br />Yes , the movie is very well executed , but I ca n't ignore that vicious , paranoid message . I have the same problem with Leni Riefenstahl 's "" Triumph of the Will . "" Or her Olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which Jesse Owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously , "" This Negro is dangerous . """	0
I rented this movie on DVD . I knew that the movie would n't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case , but once I saw that Leatherface ( Gunnar Hansen ) was in it , I had to rent it . It starts off pretty good , with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable . However , the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever , and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging . There are way too many unanswered questions . There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise , but overall this is a very sub par movie , but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee .	0
"First of all , I 'd like to say that I love the "" Ladies ' Man "" sketch on SNL . I always laugh out loud at Tim Meadows ' portrayal of Leon Phelps . However , there is a difference between an 8-minute sketch and a feature - length movie . Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show , like "" The Ladies Man Presents ... "" which is reminiscent of "" Alfred Hitchcock Presents ... "" is absolutely hilarious . There 's a great episode where Cameron Diaz role - plays Monica Lewinski , and Leon plays Bill and they call it "" The Oral Office . "" See , that 's funny ! ! ! < br />In the movie , we do n't see Leon on the show too often . In fact , he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country . And the plot revolves around his quest for true love , involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat , signed by "" Sweet Thing . "" Karyn Parsons , who is famous for playing Hillary on "" Fresh Prince of Bel Air , "" works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon . The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another . And the gags are boring as well . The first time we see Leon mention the word "" wang "" it 's pretty funny . When he uses it over and over again , supposedly trying to get a laugh , the joke has run dry . Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before , and done better , on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty - five minutes . They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies ' Man haters , who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him , to bring some life into this witless comedy . Ferrell has some funny moments , and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role . Ferrell just has that unique comic talent , and he 's funny at almost anything he does . Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo . Watching her , you ca n't but wonder "" What the hell is an Oscar - winning actress doing in this movie ? ? ! ! ! ! "" Her name was n't mentioned in the opening credits -- probably by her consent . And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself , Billy Dee Williams . Billy Dee is charismatic as always , but even he ca n't breathe enough life into this film . I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R & B hits , which impairs the film even more , giving it a horribly downbeat tone -- as if the script is n't boring enough . I mean , this is "" supposed "" to be a comedy . The soundtrack would 've been appropriate for something like "" Love Jones . "" < br />""The Ladies Man "" only has sporadic laughs . There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch . Watch both of the "" Wayne 's World "" movies , and you 'll see how it 's done . But this movie , just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallagher 's character to screen in "" Superstar , "" shows the flip side . Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL , and not on the silver screen.My score : 3 ( out of 10 )"	0
Deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that does n't take itself too seriously . Absolutely a classic in it 's own particular kind of way . This movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians . If you get a chance to see this movie do so . You 'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time . Not because it 's funny or anything mundane like that but because it 's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good , though maybe not clean , fun .	1
I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst . The gorilla looks just terrific , and the eyes were especially lifelike . It 's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top . Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine . Usually these type of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw - man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla . It 's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans , how they feel the same emotions we do , and yet how we really ca n't treat them just like people because they are n't . Not many films venture into this territory and it 's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human - animal similarity .	1
"Gruveyman2 ( comment below)you are a complete idiot ... blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to . Its that whiny arrogance , that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF , that makes you seem like such the typical LA A**hole ! The only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about SF is because you are jealous . Of course you do n't know it because you are so LA jaded . First of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city ; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals . It says nothing bad about LA ; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over LA . They recognize that they went to film school in LA and are obviously proud of that fact . They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit . The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA , was about the studio executives . The same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them , but then those same movies went on to be huge world - wide grossing films . So why would n't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system ? These are the only people they are trying to "" disassociate from "" and for good reasons ! Do n't be so sensitive ! How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the "" so called "" San Francisco director ? How is he not to be considered that ? And who directed The Godfather ? Coppola did . It was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award . So what who gave him the job ? He admits it in the documentary that he did n't even want to do the movie .... so what 's your point ? And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA ? And that proves your point how ? And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies . Movies that are now considered classics . And , when they made movies from studio funding , one , it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two , they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own . They said exactly that in the film.""Your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film . ""How the hell can "" bitchy - ness "" and "" self - congratulation "" suddenly have an "" air "" of self respect and credence .... if they never go to LA again ? What a stupid and senseless comment ! You inserted some big words in there .... and just do n't know how to use them ! And , by the way , they never claimed nor implied they were superior to LA ! So what if they are giving a guy from New York an award in LA .... again what the hell is your point ? So if they go to LA or New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF ? You make no sense.San Francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today . This film just focused on one aspect ... film - making . For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city ( not the movie ! But the city and its people ) only proves what it is we Northern Californians hate about people from LA ! THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARY ... VERY INTERESTING , ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FROM THE BAY AREA ... BUT I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ."	1
Surely one of the best British films ever made , if not one of the best films ever made anywhere . Script , cinematography , direction and acting in a class on their own . This film works on so many levels . So why is it completely unavailable on tape , DVD . Never shown on TV ? Why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the National Film Theatre in London to packed houses ?	1

"I have to admit I have always found it difficult to watch an Antonioni film from start to finish at the first try , and even for this one , I ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions . In the end , I realised perhaps it was better that way , because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one . < br />The first part seems a lot more fragmentary , which is not a bad thing , it just requires more of an effort to follow . When it gets to the desert scenes , all efforts are repaid in full . The stunning cinematography is only a part of it , what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence , the silence and vastness of it , the sense of sadness and freedom , the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters . The desert is dead , but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part . The dance between the airplane flying over and the girl 's car makes for a series of great shots . The love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful , it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times . There is of course something very stylish and studied about them , but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural , spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days . It all feels loose and unscripted ( thanks also to the understated acting ) , but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form , which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end , a really mesmerising spectacle . It just leaves you in awe.I do n't really care for some the usual objections : boring - well , yes , it is , if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists , but then if all cinema was like that , that would be truly dull and sad ; pretentious - maybe , but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills , depth , and style , pretentious is a compliment . The "" political "" criticisms make the least sense to me , I do n't see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse , patriotic requirements . It just defeats the purpose . Perhaps it 's true that , like a previous commenter remarked , Antonioni viewed these young ' hippies ' and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner , but I think that adds something rather than detracting from the film . It 's not true that hippies did not exist in Italy at the time ( think of the ' 68 protests , like in France ) , although they were obviously different from the American counterpart and in some ways even more militant . But his interest in this film was not narrowly political . The events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal , timeless quality.A special mention for the fantastic soundtrack . Amongst other things , this film , along with Easy Rider , is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary ' artsy ' music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own , but unlike the former , it uses music in a much more subtle way , blending it with the landscape rather than the action . < br />If you want traditional narrative in a film , then do n't bother . If you want to be stunned , be patient and you wo n't regret it ."	1
"This is a Frank Loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics , competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted Damon Runyon material to the musical 's "" book "" . What is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline . Abe Burrows did the book with contributions from Loesser ; Michael Kidd was the choreographer , and the outstanding art direction was contributed by Joseph Wright . The storyline can be told in two sentences . Nathan Detroit , played by Frank Sinatra , needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie , a Chicago Mob Boss . He bets odds - player Sky Masterson , well - presented by Marlon Brando , that he can not get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him ; Masterson wins the bet , saves the Mission , falls in love with the girl , gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service , and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms -- a complete lie . Of course he ends up with the lady ; and Detroit marries hi long - suffering fiancée , Vivian Blaine . Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye , Johnny Silver , Robert Keith , B.S. Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster , Sheldon Leonard , Regis Toomey , Mary Alan Kokanson , Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader , Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl , Sarah Brown . The famous musical numbers in this award - winning Broadway smash include "" Fugue For Tinhorns "" , "" Guys and Dolls "" , "" Luck Be a Lady "" , "" I 'll Know "" , "" A Person Could Develop a Cold "" , and "" The Oldest Established Permnanet Floating Crap Game in New York ! "" . Joseph L. Mankiewicz of "" Cleopatra "" and "" Letter to Three Wives "" Fame directed the proceedings ; and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving . He is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as "" Luck Be Lady "" , the varied and challenging brawl section , the Havana "" A Woman in Love "" section created for the film that precedes it , the presenting of the title song "" Guys and Dolls "" and "" Pet Me , Poppa "" set in the club where Blaine works . The acting is very uneven . Simmons seems wrong for the part at times , Brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct , charm and underplaying , even in the comedy . scenes . Sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as Nathan Detroit ; Blaine is a bit too - theatrical in selling her numbers , which she of course sings professionally . Leonard , Toomey , Kaye , Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more at all points . The stylized opening and closing are made to work well ; all in all , this film is a triumph for Loesser 's amiable and subtle lyrics , for director Mankiewicz as ringmaster , and for the genre of musicals itself , so ably justified in this instance . Delightful and very different ."	1
I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter , The Impossible Planet , and was slightly worried that the second part would n't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 Who series . But thankfully my fears were unfounded as I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one . Anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the Ood , whom have become the Devil 's pawn . There is also a bit of philosophizing on the Doctor 's part in the episode that I quite enjoyed . Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story . Might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though.My Grade : B+	1
I love sharks . And mutants . And explosions . Theoretically , with those parameters in mind , HAMMERHEAD : Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever.It is not.The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers , and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement . This might be okay if the makers were n't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be . That is to say , for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror flick that could benefit from some mystery , the shark gets a lot of screen time . Granted , it is usually shaky and erratic . I guess you 're supposed to assume that it 's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.The camera goes to a person about to get eaten , the camera goes to the shark . The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten , only now they are screaming and armless . And so on.The costuming is bad , the acting is poor , and the special effects are sub - par , but the writing is by far the worst . Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten , or so something can explode . Because LET ME TELL YOU , the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset . Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion . They shoot helicopters , there is a massive explosion . Barrels , rocks , trees , WHATEVER , they all explode , so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.Speaking of which , I do n't care how crazy a person is , I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half - person half - shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea . That is , UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.The bad thing is , the movie is so random ( and at times , boring ) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person 's prolonged interest . It might be a good one to MST3 K with your friends , but past that , if you happen to catch this bad boy on , do yourself a favor and change the channel .	0
I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review , takes pity on me , whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in her freaky / funny world . But in all seriousness , it was good . First episode is obviously finding it 's feet , but it 's got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it . It 's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy , but that 's good thing , too much has a laughter - track to it , and this would n't be right with cues when to laugh , it 's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all . I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it 's weird characters and incredibly strong central character . Well worth a watch , look forward to the following episodes . A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there . < br />ps , Sarah ? Call me ....	1
"On MTV cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection . This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "" gangster movie "" . Sure , there are gangsters and mobs in it , but that 's not the point of Scarface . Tony Montana ( Al Pacino ) is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life . He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well - known drug lord . Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life . The classic phrase : "" Say hello to my little friend !

... for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared.First off , the beginning did have elements of style .... and if handled well , could have become a cult classic , a - la pulp fiction or a Desi desperado ... but the plot ( was there one ? ) begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English , a call center smart Alec , a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb , a levitating , gravity defying hit - man and a cop with a hundred ( or was it a thousand ) black cat commandos on their trail .... good ingredients in competent hands . But this is where I would like to ask the director : Sir , what were you smoking?Im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers . < br />Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music ... watch the videos ... hear the airplay and you wo nt be disappointed . Vishal- Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes . < br />How I wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy .... As I sign off , I want to really , badly know how does Akshay 's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond ... what were you editors doing ? Tashan , maybe ...	0
Incredibly intriguing and captivating , I found it impossible to turn away once I began to watch . I am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant , strange as this may sound I could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations . < br />From a cinematographic I thought there was great use of light and texture . From the orange glow of the summer light , down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me.From a character perspective I thought the notion of Victor Vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired , each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself.Beyond that , having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation , I can say the situation felt particularly realistic . The awkwardness , the accent , the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me.I think this film worked for me because I began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion , well worth a watch .	1
I would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.Why I did n't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie I can not say . I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately ! ! Several people in our theater did and sadly I did n't follow them out.The story lacked all criteria for a movie . NO plot . Awful acting ! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in . Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk . I did like the tazer scene . Too bad it did n't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot . Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film !	0
This is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises , but who love the history and traditions of Sci - Fi and Classic Hollywood movies . Each alien of the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic Sci - Fi character or member of Hollywood royalty and it 's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of Big Bean .	1
"Yet another remake of "" Fistful of Dollars "" , Sergio Leone 's remake of Kurosawa 's "" Yojimbo "" ( suggested by the novel ' Red Harvest').This one is strictly a B - Movie ; taken as that , it is rather enjoyable . the direction is crisp , the acting full of verve , the limitations of its ' direct - to - video ' photography well - handled.The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the ' fistful'/'yojimbo ' plot to a sub - plot from Leone 's ' Once Upon a Time in the West ' . Although leone directed both ' Fistful ' and ' West ' , his motivations behind the two films could n't be anymore different . The ' Man With No Name ' ( Eastwood ) is a borderline socio - path with a soft spot for broken families . Harmonica ( Chaeles Bronson ) is obsessed with his own broken family , and obsessed with revenge . These two characters would not have had much to do with each other . In order to bring them together , ' Gun Crazy ' has to twist it 's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we 're actually following.But this is a B - Movie after all , and filled with action and silliness ; it 's entertaining on that level , just do n't expect anything more ."	1
Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about . Unfortunately , a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen , Samurai , the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from . Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings . The Geisha dances were not authentic . There was far too much use of Chinese music . A minor but essential detail : proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen . The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly , some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons .	0
I love this show . Now , I 'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows , so if it bares any resemblance to them , I did n't notice . I like the storybook quality of the cinematography . I even like the love story , even though as I am enjoying it I wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as Ned can not touch Chuck or else ... well , you know . I even like Chuck , I do n't find her annoying at all , and I generally hate overly sweet , nice , perfect characters . I even like the narrator 's voice , even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some Walgreens commercials . I could nitpick about all the other things about Ned 's predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future but I just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers weave .	1
"This is a thinking man 's silly movie . If you do n't expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and I - from casting the "" voice "" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of Big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way.It 's not for everyone , but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie ."	1
If it was n't for the bad dialogues and script . I mean , the direction was really in touch with it 's subject . The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life . But in the end , the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together . I would highly suggest not to watch this . Unless you 're a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in . Even if the result lately are rather poor . This is , after S1m0ne , a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles .	0
"You may say to yourself , "" Don Johnson as Elvis ? Can that work ? Is it possible ? Seems like an terrible choice to me , but perhaps I should have an open mind . Maybe I 'll be surprised . Maybe he can pull it off . ""NOT!Don Johnson is not a bad actor . But he is an awful Elvis . He 's too short , too weak - voiced , too sharply featured ... well you 've already imagined how bad he would be . Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy - handed eye - liner and mascara and it 's a big fat embarrassing mess.The best I can say is that since Johnson 's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off , after a while you do n't even think of him as Elvis anymore . You see him as some other crazed pop star instead . Then , on that level , the movie becomes watchable.Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall , beauty queen , Linda Thompson . But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty , elegance and intelligence we 've come to expect from all her roles . There may be too much intelligence in her performance . You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.There 's nothing new to this story ; we 've heard it many times before . If you 've looking for new info or insight , you wo n't find it . It 's told as a love story - an unrequited one : Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs ."	0
At first , three words : READ THE BOOK ! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters . I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film . It was ludicrous , with half a heart and the story bad explained . The novel - in the first place ! - was n't meant to focus on an adventure ! That 's only the surroundings . In the film , the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat ! Additional , the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious ! They screwed it up ! ... I 'll never watch it again !	0
""" Envy "" is bad for a number of reasons . Yes , there are unlikeable characters . That 's not the problem . It is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all . "" The War of the Roses "" featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate , whereas in "" Envy "" the introduction is thin , the characters are never believable , and the plot only makes things worse.Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I 'm a fan of his work most of the time . Stiller campaigned to have this released straight - to - video and now I can see why . The movie proposes that he 's "" best friends "" with Jack Black , but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate Stiller hates Black . I thought this would develop into some sort of one - sided relationship ( a la "" The Cable Guy "" ) but it never does , instead Stiller insists he 's his "" best friend "" and I felt confused as he seemed to treat Black like , well , "" poo . "" The movie 's plot is ridiculous but it does n't matter , because it 's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale . Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess . Walken gives a good performance but Black is off - key and annoying ( and I usually find him very funny ) . No , it 's not a horrible film but I still ca n't believe Barry Levinson ( "" Rain Man , "" "" Sleepers "" ) is responsible for this - it 's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better . I wish Va - Poo - Rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear forever ...."	0
"Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company ( Studio A ) , he practically outdid the "" Master "" right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes . So , while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered ( starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses , coiffed and made up as if they 're about to hit the catwalk ) remained very much present and accounted for , Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content . In doing so , he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first  and IMHO best  film NIGHT TRIPS . Cam 's maiden effort , ELEMENTS OF DESIRE , might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic ( with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes ) , but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece.The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories , with an extended orgy at the conclusion . Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other 's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh . Busty Crystal Gold ( here : "" Catalina "" ) was rarely more than a reliable second - stringer , adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs , yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur . Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne , making out with Marc Davis ( for the record , the latter two were an item at the time ) under a waterfall , complete the eye candy section of the movie.Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson ( "" Daisy "" back then ) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers ( "" Mark Slade "" on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry ) of all vital juices , albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast , the scene 's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place . Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down , a prospect too tantalizing for prim ' n ' proper business woman Asia Carrera ( at her all time most achingly pretty ) to pass up . Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion.With sex that proves either artsy or hot , and more often than not both , Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film 's gastronomic analogy the title implies . Couples may be the prime intended audience , but an alternation between naughty ' n ' nice should rightfully include that "" something for everything "" recipe so many adult features are aiming for . Acting as his own DoP , the director shows great eye for detail , like the shot of Asia Carrera 's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud , enriching his vision . This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one , as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate  effectively making him a replacement 's replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures ."	1
"The story deals about Jet Li who has to fight against his old < br />friends . But there is one problem , the friends are superfighters .

"Maybe some people may consider this a slow movie . However , it 's precisely this "" slow burning "" that allows it to profoundly affect the viewer . Like that marvelous first scene : first , we can hear the voices ; then , we are allowed to see the characters ; finally , the camera slowly pans back and to the side and we see another character , a young man who is just sitting there , apparently not even listening to the conversation or , at least , not really caring . The fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the movie 's strategy : allowing the character to develop and be determined by the environment surrounding him but without remarking the points more than necessary . People come and go , flow in and out of his life . Although most of the movie follows him ( and most of the supporting characters are only seen when close to him , defined according to the relationship maintained with him ) , we are induced to believe that we are being objective , so subtle is the director touch ."	1
This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar Harold Robbins formula : ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world , in this case the movie industry . But despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable , this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable . Zadora ( to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable ) never convinces as a screenwriter . One would expect a movie about movie - making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process . But the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters : observance , skill with words , a love - hate relationship with one 's own creative abilities . Her character is as empty as a donut hole . And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here . The cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening . And the scenes never really hang together , so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties . Avoid .	0
"I always feel strange and guilty saying it ( because I 'm a fairly well - educated non - teenager ) , but I actually sort of like the Olsen twins , and I respect the movies they make , even though I 've never really been their target audience . "" When in Rome "" was a traditional Mary - Kate and Ashley movie , complete with the foreign travel , accents , motorbikes , adult romance as a "" B "" storyline , fashion orientation , and even the gag reel over the credits . I enjoyed myself . "" When in Rome "" and the other Olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they 're not ; most of the time , they only premiere on video , and they never claim to be the next "" Citizen Kane "" or even "" An Affair to Remember . "" My point is , people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another Olsen twin movie will be disappointed.That said , those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves . For those of us who 've watched them since the first episodes of "" Full House , "" it 's really great to see them growing into more mature roles . This movie provides important historical and geographical information , just like many of their other movies ( remember 10 Downing Street from "" Winning London "" and the visit to the Louvre from "" Passport to Paris "" ? ) as well as providing good , clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family.As long as I still feel like I 'm on my soapbox , and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie , let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the Olsen twins : in order to be a fan of the Olsen twins , you do n't have to be some pre - teen "" valley girl "" from California . In fact , that 's not really the target audience . If it were , the MK&A fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through Gap or some store like that , not Wal - Mart . "" When in Rome , "" while it does feature "" high fashion "" and globe - trotting and two girls from a valley in Cali , is n't really ABOUT that ... it 's more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places . If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes , so be it . That 's called marketing -- you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing . At least they 're sending a good message , even if the means seem a little superficial . < br />Basically , do n't knock the film until you 've seen it , and then do n't knock it until you 've tried to understand what the Olsen twins do : they encourage young girls to be creative , intuitive , and driven young women . This movie does that , I think , just like their others . Kids - enjoy . Parents - do the same . If you like the Olsen twins , you wo n't be disappointed ."	1
This movie has Wild Bill Hickok , Calamity Jane , Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together . Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him . This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time . This movie starts out with Lincoln 's assassination and it also deals with an Indian war . Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home . This movie also deals with Custer 's last stand and is far from accurate . Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually do n't like Jean Arthur but i liked her here .	1
This movie has everything . Emotion , power , affection , Stephane Rideau 's adorable naked beach dance ... It exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship . Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay does n't mean there is n't quite useful insight for anybody in it . I would probably classify it as a gay movie , but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people . Mathieu 's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society does n't encourage us to act any differently , and that is what engenders the discord between him and Cedric . This is definitely a must - see ! ! ! !	1
"In the 60 's , having as the background the rehearsal and recording of "" Sympathy for the Devil "" in the classic album "" Beggar 's Banquet "" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones  Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Charlie Watts , Bill Wyman and Brian Jones  plus Marianne Faithful , Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements  the Black Power through the Black Panthers , the feminism , the communism , the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters : "" The Stones Rolling ; "" Outside Black Novel "" ; "" Sight and Sound "" ; "" All About Eve "" ; "" The Heart of Occident "" ; "" Inside Black Syntax "" ; and , "" Under the Stones the Beach"".""Sympathy for the Devil "" is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director Jean - Luc Godard .

My vote is three.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Sympathy for the Devil """	0
British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types : the quiet , introspective , usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . Settings , characters , and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . Butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type . < br />The scripts are very verbal , including long interior monologues by the main character Ria , a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman ( who makes his interest in her quite clear ) , she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered.The acting and scripts are always on the money , which makes one 's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one : I was neither blown away by it nor turned off . My mother , on the other hand , adored this show . I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria 's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one 's reaction to Butterflies .	1
""" The Notorious Bettie Page "" ( 2005 ) < br />Directed By : Mary Harron < br />Starring : Gretchen Mol , Chris Bauer , Lili Taylor , Sarah Paulson , & David Strathairn < br />MPAA Rating : "" R "" ( for nudity , sexual content and some language ) < br />It seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life . From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash , biopics are very posh right now . "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is the latest of these to be released on DVD . It features Gretchen Mol as the world 's most famous pin - up model , Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color . Unlike "" Ray "" , "" Walk the Line "" , and "" Finding Neverland "" , however , this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year . This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page 's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested . This does not mean , however , that it is a bad movie . In fact , "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie -- a solid work of cinema . This film focuses more on Page 's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography . It is filmed with fervor and care and Mary Harron 's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about.Everyone knows Bettie Page ( played by Mol ) . Whether you know her as an icon  or a simple porn star  you know her . She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time . Now , most people know her as one of America 's first sex symbols -- a legend to many models , especially those of Playboy and other adult - oriented magazines . She lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Page 's bondage - style photos were just the thing to push the American public into an uproar . In fact , the photos launched a full - fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn.The performances in "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out . Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant . I understand that , when she was announced for the role , many people were skeptical . Her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when I think of great performances . Now , it will . She completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance . David Strathairn is fresh off of last year 's "" Good Night , and Good Luck "" , in which he gave one of 2005 's best performances . Here , he gives yet another fine performance  even though he is slightly underused . I was shocked at how very limited his screen time was  but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie . The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was that in "" The Haunting "" ( 1999 ) . While most people ignored the movie , I found it to be an enjoyable , if not completely shallow , horror movie and I also have always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally - distraught Nell . Here , Taylor gives yet another credible performance . She gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol.After everything was said and done , I realized that "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" can not be compared to other biopics , such as "" Finding Neverland "" and "" Walk the Line "" . It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career , from the beginning to the end . Her personal life is briefly implied , but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point . We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will have  but we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life . She is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself . After all , she was an adult model turned Christian missionary . This movie does not over dramatize anything . It could have included fictitious moments of Page sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her . It could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain , trying to escape the ghosts of her past  and yet it does not . "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" tells a simple story and that is something rare by today 's standards . Fortunately , it is quite refreshing.Final Thought : "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography.Overall Rating : 9/10 ( A )"	1
Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies . They could n't live together , nor apart . Babbling constantly , sometimes at the same time , they hashed and re - hashed the past ; going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda . I found myself laughing at times , but mostly I was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were . See this one .	1
"The London Underground has something inherently creepy about it , with its long winding tunnels , the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground , and of course the rats roaming the tracks . It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often . It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat , featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel , and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London . So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep.I thought the film started off well , with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving , followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London . However , Creep went downhill from here , and I found myself wishing that I 'd switched it off after this opening scene , leaving me with a favourable impression of the film . All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable , even Potente herself , and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness . he also made the mistake of showing the "" monster "" in full lighting , where he ceases to become remotely scary , and reveals his name to be Craig . How can you have a monster called Craig ? It turns into an X Files - type thing , and reminds one of the episode Tombs . In fact , I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.As for the infamous sexualised violence , it is very graphic , disturbing and totally unnecessary . It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value . The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror , which is a mistake as it 's only halfway through the film.So there you go . The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell , one of my favourite occasional actors . You do n't see him very often , but when he 's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner . Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius , unfortunately the only one evident in the film ."	0
Undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups . It tells the story of Patrick Galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some weird phainomena . The game is set in Ireland after World War one so do n't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers . All the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on . Our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time : he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left . So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game ! The graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power P.C .. Level design is also cool and atmospheric . Mostly the game revolves around the Covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress . Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot ( something very rare for a First person shooter ) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent . But the game has two main flaws . First of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration . Secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry . As far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced . Most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult . Overall undying is a great game . Definitely one of the best fps out there .	1
The 60s ( 1999 ) D : Mark Piznarski . Josh Hamilton , Julia Stiles , Jerry O'Connell , Jeremy Sisto , Jordana Brewster , Leonard Roberts , Bill Smitrovich , Annie Corley , Charles S. Dutton . NBC mini - series ( later released to video / DVD as full length feature film ) about the treacherous 1960s , as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family . The film 's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families . However , Dutton 's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull , incoherent , and downright awful 2nd half . RATING : 4 out of 10 . Not rated ( later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release ) .	0
I found Darkness to be just too DARK . It had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas , not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go UGH ! BUT , it was underlit to the point of confusion . You do n't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on Super 8 Film , you already have all that nasty grain to deal with . As with Nathan Schiff movies , it 's just too much . Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film , but he lacks the know - how to do it . The camera is never pointed in the right place , lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well . The actors are all pretty uneven and hammy . But despite these negatives , the music is good , the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances . Is this a classic like it says ? Is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise ? NO . But it is a good first try . Now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie ( from what I understand here the only one they have ever finished ) for a while and try again , they may do better .	0
"Former private eye - turned - security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession . His assignment : to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California ... and apparently wanted by suit - and - tie racketeers . Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre , without enough sting or wit ( or involving plot dynamics ) in the screenplay . Director and co - scenarist Paul Magwood ( who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement ) does n't give off the impression of having high regard for the ' 40s films his "" Chandler "" was borne from ; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled , but also bitter - tinged and somewhat indifferent . The handling is curiously , commendably low - keyed , and Warren Oates is well - cast as this ' 70s variant on the ' private dick ' archetype , but the movie does n't have any snap . Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast -- though neither has much to do , and Caron 's hot - and - cold running character is exasperating throughout . Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold , nice location shooting , but it fails to come to any kind of a boil . * 1/2 from * * * *"	0
"Dialogue : stilted , clichéd ; Acting : hammy , clichéd ; Plot : predictable , clichéd.Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this "" B "" rubbish ? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made , Kinski had masterpieces like "" Tess "" and "" Cat People "" behind her ... Must have been desperate.The bad guys all have bad - guy accents - * bad * bad - guy accents ! ( Plummer especially ! Where * did * he learn to do "" German "" ? ) and most of them have bad - guy sneers as well . The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . The good guy survives , amongst other things : * a 5 "" throwing knife buried hilt - deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ; * marines ' machine - gun fire ( I think someone referred to a .50 ) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ; * several fist - fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium - first into a door frame ; * a fall , backwards , from what looks like the third floor , onto paving , without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . The script has exactly 3 clever lines , the rest of the time it 's all so dull and boring.OK it 's not all bad . Plummer does bring a certain class to his part , and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . Of course that does n't say much , but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . He delivers his "" Ve haff vays and meance "" type lines with some menace , but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain.This movie is truly an awful waste of time . The acting , such as it is , is sort of 70 's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee 's very obviously faked fight scenes , but it 's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film . Do n't bother ."	0

"A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort . "" Holes "" does n't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp . For the first time events are not explained in details . The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer . I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie . But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story . Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities . ( One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character , like learning to read wo n't contribute to that ) . "" Holes "" is a movie that is smart and beautiful . A must watch !"	1

"If you are uninitiated to the Gundam world , this is a good place to start . If you are burned out on Star Wars or Star Trek , here is a compelling , realistic sci - fi series you can become immersed in . Not the simplistic boy - saves - world - in - giant robot story you might have expected , but rather a complex , emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the "" good "" and "" bad "" guys is decidedly less than distinct.Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha , a young , naive boy living in a neutral space colony . He spends his days daydreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends . During the course of this series , Al befriends an "" enemy "" soldier , Bernie Wiseman . By the end , little Al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice.I loved this OAV series , with its cool mecha designs , involving story , and likeable characters . I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime , or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment ."	1
"Wow , I forgot how great this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking through the garage . It 's a kind of strange combination of a bio of Michael Jackson , a collection of musical vignettes , and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids . The vignettes are good ( especially Speed Demon ) , but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment , in which Michael Jackson turns into a car , a robot , and finally a spaceship ( and it 's just as weird as it sounds ) . Joe Pesci is hilarious , and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!The real gem however is the incredible "" Smooth Criminal "" video , which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone !"	1
I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that he 's made on DVD except for Hotel Room & the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie . So , when I found out about this , I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what IS this ? It 's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny . Maybe I do n't know what 's good , but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks , too . Let me make it clear that I did n't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have . All in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity . I highly recommend you do n't spend your money on this . 2 out of 10 .	0
"I 'm a nice guy , and I like to think of myself as genre - tolerant . And , I guess by that , I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in . If nothing else , that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films , which I do n't like doing.The plot in this one was patently obvious , the production values very low and sets , uhm , simplistic . The acting rose into "" good for a high school play "" territory from time to time . My feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was.Worst of all , the sex , while reasonably plentiful , was fairly mundane , hampered by , at least in my copy , a "" sound - over "" that was inconsistent with the action ( climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra ? ? ? ) . There was definitely no "" edge "" to it at all -- nothing distinguishing or interesting , and with surprisingly quick cuts.My vote is a "" 1 "" then , with the following summary statement : would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded , and the rest of the movie condensed ."	0
The film is poorly casted , except for some familiar old Hollywood names . Other performances by unknown names ( i.e. , Jennifer Gabrielle ) are uninspiring . I have seen other films by this director , unfortunately this is one of his worst . Perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay ? < br />In a positive note , Kim Bassinger 's and Pat Morita 's performance saved the movie from oblivion . I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid , though . There are many good movies to see , and in short , this one is not one of them . Save your money and the celluloid . < br />Jason Vanness	0
The secret is ... this movie blows . Sorry , but it just did . < br />****SPOILER****In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM , Beth , played admirably by Dorie Barton , joins several friends on a Spring Break trip . The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation . Then , the deaths begin . First one then another then another of the friends is murdered , leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results . < br />One note , Dorie Barton is the poor man 's Reese Witherspoonshe looks like Reese , acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup . Maybe that 's how they cast her ? Anyhoo , decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing .	0
I like my Ronald Colman dashing and debonair , the fellow you see in such films as If I Were King and Kismet . I like him as the epitome of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest . A brooding Colman is n't a favorite of mine.But in A Double Life precisely because his part as actor Anthony John is so offbeat for him , Colman was recognized with a Best Actor Oscar for 1947 . It became his best known part.Colman is an actor who really does take the Method quite seriously . He 's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he 's quite the jovial fellow . For a change of pace now that that play has concluded its Broadway run , Colman is bringing a revival of Othello to New York . About as opposite a part as you can get.His leading lady in both is his former wife Signe Hasso who loves him dearly , but ca n't take his change of moods when he 's at work . Colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back . But he 's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with her role as Desdemona.Unfortunately Shelley Winters as a poor waitress who a depressed Colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor Desdemona in the play . Killed in the same manner and now it 's a matter for homicide cop Joe Sawyer.Colman 's performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors ? I 'd shudder to think so , were there any unsolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles then they essayed Othello . < br />I could never quite buy the story for that reason , but I certainly do applaud Ronald Colman and what he did with the part . I 'm sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the Oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father . Others in the running that year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen 's Agreement , John Garfield for Body and Soul , and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra.Colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including Edmond O'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman 's jealous fantasy . Still you will find no Iago equivalent in A Double Life , no one prodding the jealousy , it 's all in his own mind.And that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century .	1
"Those of the "" Instant Gratification "" era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film 's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count . The fact is , "" The Empty Acre "" is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done.If you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back - story could have come off the back of a Count Chocula box , "" The Empty Acre "" is the movie for you.Set in the decaying remnants of the rural American dream , "" The Empty Acre "" is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six - month - old baby . As the couple 's weak relationship falls apart , a larger story plays out in the background . At night , a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path , leaving no sign that it was ever there.The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening , and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer / director 's faith in an intellectual audience.There seems to be a sub - text concerning the death of the American dream , but I would hardly call the film an allegory . Riveting , well acted , and technically astute , "" The Empty Acre "" is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love ."	1
This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap . Do n't waste your time watching this . Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues . Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means !	0
Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye - opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of Mumbai 's elite . From the fake kisses to the plastered smiles , Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous . Backstabbing , gossip , corruption , and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam . Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where Social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality . Everyone is constantly craving for more money , more fame , and a higher reputation , driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation . Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes . The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist . She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind - boggling frenzy that the socialites live in . Bollywood , business tycoons , politicians , and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess ! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi . Terrific film with excellent character development !	1
"The idea of making a film about the Beatles sounds doomed idea , as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic Beatles . Then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past , but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material . This is exactly what ' Birth of the Beatles ' offers to us , the simple story known to us without any extravaganza.<br / > * * * SPOILERS here on * * * < br />Be warned that not everything is that accurate as some Beatles - graduates might expect . The Beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time . The Beatles perform "" Ask Me Why "" , "" P.S. I Love You "" and even "" Do n't Bother Me "" . The Beatles - graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at Hamburg , the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the Beatles they have learned to know them . Of that original Hamburg repertoire only "" Johnny B. Goode "" and Stu Sutcliffe 's "" Love Me Tender "" are retained.The guys who play the Beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals , but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate . The guy who plays Lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either . Brian Epstein is great and the moment when he sacks Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film . Also as a bonus you get to see the original Cavern club in the film ."	1
To this day when you speak of the Japanese cinema , most folks wo n't talk about Rashomon , or the Seven Ronin , or Ran . To the masses the Japanese cinema means all those monsters we 've grown to love destroying those Japanese cities over and over again , lots of times in battles with each other . The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who 's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space , Ghidrah.Oddly enough in keeping with the times , the special effects got slightly better . But part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed , they looked so phony , maybe three steps above Ed Wood.Some visitors from the future have time traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered . And in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when he protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from those American troops . But later on with atomic testing on Bikini , Godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like Barney became the mean machine we 've grown to know in the cinema.Of course you eliminate Godzilla than you give Ghidrah a clear field to wreck Japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out . More I wo n't say , but we all know Japan is doing reasonably well as 2010.Like all the other Japanese monster films , just sit back and enjoy the mayhem .	0
I simply can not believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film . It moved me to leave this comment ! This is just an obvious attempt to cash - in on the success of the first film . The dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film.The storyline is ridiculous , the portrayal of the French police laughable and the characterisation of Doyle a mile away from the first film.How many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in ? The ease at which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic . Like all the French Police were just drinking coffee until Doyle turns up from America and does some REAL police work . What a joke . Try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets . Pathetic . < br />A truly awful sequel , anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy .	0
This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks . Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in . Songs on All India Radio , especially Inhi LogoN ne were played so often that I was sick of them at the time , despite recognising their beauty ! < br />Yes , it did take all those years to make . This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film ; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes , not surprising ! ! Not only does Meena Kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to Lata 's voice . Inhi logoN ne has her 50 's younger voice while songs that were re - recorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development . I only wish someone would find the Ghulam Mohammad songs that were n't included in the film , because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them . Lata in a recent interview ( 2007 ) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with , apart from Madan Mohan ( a great personal friend ) . Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs , very unusual . There is only a brief shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumari . Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon . Any other film , this song would have had close - ups of both of them.As for this being the finest film ever , I would beg to differ . It means you have missed a lot of Indian cinema , in no particular order , films like Barsaat ( old ) , Devdas ( older versions ) , Bandini , Do Bigha Zameen , Garam Hava , Dastak , Guddi , Aan , Pyasa , Kagaz ke Phool , Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam , Kabuliwallah , Abhimaan , Guide , Sujatha , Bombay ka Babu , Daag , Parineeta ( old ) , Umrao Jaan , etc . etc . And if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from Barsat Ki Raat to Naya Daur , Teesri Manzil , Mahal , Aag , Jugnu , Anand , Mera Naam Joker : the list is really endless!So enjoy Pakeezah but do n't miss out on any of the above ...	1
for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects , watch this movie ! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen . you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff .	1
"This show is painful to watch ... < br />It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show , from the ever changing "" jobs "" , boyfriends , and cast . It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what , and came up with this crappy show . They cast her as a teen , surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings , and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy . Soon , they realize that she needs a "" clique "" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me . Somehow , ABC has now decided that it is a "" family "" show , and thrown it into it 's afternoon lineup on ABC Family ."	0
If utterly facile , regressive , self - indulgent , anti - establishment , anti - civilisation juvenilia appeals to you , then this is the ideal film . Very poorly scripted , with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand - held camera throughout , this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic , Manichean terms : all adults ( especially teachers , parents , priests and doctors ) are insensitive and bumbling at best , and predatory monsters at worst . The only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming ( yawn ) and infantile regression ( literally ) in a primitive cave - like space in the woods , with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again , in the woods ( naturally ... ) . Displays all the weaknesses of a first film , and plenty more besides .	0
"What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining . "" Right to Die "" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.Spoilers here : < br />Top credits also go to the dead - on performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen .

"If my memory is correct , when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry . If that 's what it 's supposed to be , it does n't really work . It just is n't that funny . Setting that rather significant ( since this is called a comedy ! ) failure aside , since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter , I 'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour , except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull . < br />For over an hour , this movie really does n't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters . Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls are n't giving "" full service "" - a euphemism for actual sex . As for the girls themselves , Betty 's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business , Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is - well , Leah is a somewhat strange , undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well , because she 's in it ! I have no idea what her character was about . Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.The movie meanders about and does n't offer much until the "" twist "" reveals Conrad to be the bad guy . We should have gotten to that point sooner . The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - Conrad 's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls . That plan for revenge was pretty good , and you 're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you 're wondering why you wasted your time with this . Had the story been more focused on the revenge , this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.The performances from the 4 leads were all OK , although I did n't think anyone came across as outstanding . All four characters were a bit shallow . Cindy was a sympathetic character , and so was Conrad for a while , although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie . Given the subject matter , there 's surprisingly little nudity ( and what there is is restricted to one scene . ) In fact , there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this . As for the overall quality of the movie , it 's a low - budget effort , which shows , although you expect a certain griminess , I suppose , of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour , so that 's forgivable . It certainly says something , though , that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer - director Soo Lyu 's resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry - that it was n't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards - the Canadian version of the Oscars . 4/10 - and I 'm being a bit generous with that ."	0
When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness ' death , this was the first of his many films I thought of re - seeing . What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years . And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame . His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears . Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites .	1
This movie is god awful . Not one quality to this movie . You would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad . The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst I 've ever seen . This movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably . If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead . If you want to watch a good cheap shot on video Zombie movie like this but way better than watch Redneck Zombies . Please avoid this movie at all costs . It is unwatchable and pointless . You 've been warned . I 've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie .	0
Nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations , speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous . This is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved . Do n't waste your time .	0
"Holy crap this is so hysterical ! Why are n't American comedies written like this ? For anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb-- there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels ! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot . I could n't believe it was the same guy as House ! There are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time . Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler Edmund . This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series . And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series , "" the oppressed mass "" Baldrick . Some of my favorite lines : "" When someone messes with a Wellington he really puts his foot in it "" and Baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin Macadder "" the top kipper salesman "" and homicidal swordsman from Scotland ."	1
"Pet Semetary ( 1989 ) 9/10 The Creed family have just moved into the small town of Ludlow . The family consists of a father , Louis , a mother , Rachel , a brother Gage , and a daughter , Ellen . They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall . Jud is 89 , and could basically tell you about the entire history of Ludlow.Behind the Creed 's new house , there is a path leading to a pet cemetery ( spelled pet sematary ) . When Ellen wants to go up to see it , Jud willfully takes the family on a trip . That is the start of hell for the Creed family.When Rachel and the kids are gone , Ellen 's cat Church dies . Jud feels that Ellen is n't ready for the death of her cat , so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path , past the pet cemetery.Jud tells Louis of this burial ground , once used by Micmac Indians . Louis buries Church , without Jud 's help . A couple of days later , Church returns , alive , but from hell.This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me , aside from "" The Exorcist . "" The greatest performance would ever be Zelda , Rachel 's sister with spinal meningitis , or Victor Pascow , a ghost who tries to help the Creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead.The music in this movie plays an extravagant part . It is at the same time sad and mysterious . It goes along with the movie wonderfully.9/10"	1
Felt it was very balanced in showing what Jehovahs Witnesses have done in protecting American freedoms . It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses . I also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a Jehovahs Witness affects non - witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they do n't celebrate holidays , the sad part is that non - witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners / visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays . When it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care , what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained , which would you prefer to treat your loved ones ? I highly recommend this video !	1
I caught this on Showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful . WHO 'S YOUR DADDY ? stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior Chris Hughes , a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents . Though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun , it is ruined by inept directing from first - time director Andy Fickman , a clichéd and predictable screenplay , and acting that is even bad by direct - to - video standards . Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend . Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud . 1/10	0
"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell , I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of ' Joshua . ' Heck , I was n't even aware he was in ' Joshua ' until I started the movie . So it goes without saying , I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie , not the leads . A sort of ' Rosemary 's Baby , ' ' The Omen ' or any other demonic kid movie ' Joshua ' was billed . Unfortunately , it fell flat . Slow , incredibly slow , and flat . Yet , I continued on to see how this would all resolve , hoping beyond belief , the ending climax would shed some light on the subject . Okay , I admit , it did ( a wee bit ) but what a stale closing . And what a low - low budget movie , or at least that 's how they designed it . A person falls  you do n't see the drop , you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood . A person gets hit by a cab  you do n't see it , you see someone complaining , holding a bike up . I 'm not sure if this is called "" style "" or laziness or simply , lack of funds for special effects . We have a "" rich "" family with a crazy mom , a workaholic father attempting to balance everything , a kid  Joshua , who may / may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot . She cries as much as we see how many days she 's alive  and what was that about ? Are there rats above or is it Joshua ? Is his mother nuts ? Is Joshua crazy ? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family ? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers ? Or does he drive his family to the brink ? I do n't think so . They were nuts prior , and no "" so - called "" acting could make me believe otherwise . Unfortunately , barely any questions were answered , barely any open doors shut . I 'm sure that might have been the idea , but for Pete 's sake , give me something . Anything . There are plenty better kid - gone - wild movies to explore . Joshua 's more like the Mini - Me of the antichrist ."	0
"The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy 's art , his search for closeness with the land and the water , and his sense of proportion -- and so gently , so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us . "" Rivers and Tides "" loves Goldsworthy 's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world , a world that hides its power in plain sight . See this movie !"	1
"I remember going to see the movie in the summer of ' 78 with my parents , and being pretty into it at the time . Of course , I was seven at the time.Right before the Jackson movies came out , my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid - way through the animation process for this movie , and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production . Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping , the animation technique for people on a budget , this is saying something . Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word . There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen , with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.Because of budget constraints , the movie -- already a compression of "" The Fellowship of the Rings "" and part of "" The Two Towers "" -- was pared down even more . What you get is sort of like a film - strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.Its not all bad , though , the animation brings a warmth to it , that I found lacking in the Jackson movies . Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came . Several years later , a half - hearted half - hour long TV special was aired , which was meant to wrap things up . All I will say about that is that it was a musical ."	0
"There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is . It simply defies description . Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims ' mouth , which kills them or turns them into zombies . The whole thing is so wonky that it 's stunning . There 's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm not making this stuff up . The computer also controls things like cars , even though there 's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.The "" film "" is total trash . Surreal bad trash . Spectacularly , one - of - a - kind bad trash . There 's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there , which are n't very hot or erotic . There 's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula , which had me rolling on the floor.Definitely one of the worst movies ever made . Up there with the equally wretched direct - to - home video BOARDINGHOUSE , or BOOGEYMAN II ( both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush ! ) . At least it 's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on ."	0
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about . Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about . One man , Daddy , has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity . The kids grow up , one all be it , in the hard way , to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is , the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall . ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances . Yes , I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent . This true to life is one which every young adult , and parent , would do well to see , although some will not realize it until they too are parents . A must see for those who care about their families .	1
One night I stumbled upon this on the satellite station Bravo . Initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it . To be perfectly honest i was n't disappointed . The main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well . You would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film!My only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays Melnik . Christ its bad!The prison guard Hank is woeful too . All he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co - guard Wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for Hank he gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end . The music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions . This movie is well watching alone for the beautiful , talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas	1
Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) , who is just on the verge of puberty , begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life -- especially involving a boy named Mark ( Elliott Spiers ) who she meets in her dreams.Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments . Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating , this is NOT for children . Also , if you hate fantasies stay far away . But if you 're game for something different this fits the bill.Well directed by Bernard Rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice , scary jolts . The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke -- she 's not a very good actress ( it 's no surprise that this has been her only film ) and it hurts the movie . However , everybody else is just great.Spiers is very good as Mark ; Glenne Headley ( faking a British accent very well ) is also very good as Anna 's mother and Ben Cross is both frightening and sympathetic as Anna 's father.A sleeper hit when released in 1988 , it 's since faded away . That 's too bad -- it 's really very good .	1
This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed . The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere . This is a drama , but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was . That 's never a good sign . The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien 's roommates / bandmates . They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously . The cheesy dropping of Beatles lyrics was just absurd . The soundtrack was excellent , however , and was probably the best part of the movie . Unless you 're one of those crazy , rabid Dominic Monaghan fans , do n't bother with this one .	0
The acting is pretty cheesy , but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now Detroit area automotive engineers , this is a great movie . I even work with a Japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny.Jay Leno was showing his age last night on The Tonight Show ! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago . The opening scene , with the drag race on what appears to be Woodward Ave was great.Leno also owns some bad a * * cars now , it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection . I 'm sure the blown Vette in the opening scene was his own car.Typical 80s movie . Watch it and enjoy . No computer generated crap !	1
Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk . One of the world 's great portrayers of bumbling incompetence . . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster . As Pops Romano , he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan 's manic foolishness . Respectable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss , Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk 's advisor and Benedict Arnold.The plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and , in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase , could have proved a great comedic vehicle . Kattan , who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman , just provides a muddled mess . Sadly , Peter Berg and Chris Penn , who portray his misfit brothers , both fall far short of their proven capability.There are some very funny scenes , but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones . What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies . There is no ' second level ' of wit riding over the slapstick . No cultural references that only the adults get . . no double entendre . . it is just silly.And , by the way , this does n't all mean that I am recommending it for your 9-year - old , because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions .	0
""" Kalifornia "" is one of my all - time favourite movies , and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s . The film has a very stylish surface to it , but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others . One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances , Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer - trash psycho named Early . Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly . Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend , her innocence is almost heart - breaking . "" Kalifornia "" has a very simple plot to it , that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour , but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder , as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality . There are alot of shocking scenes , and it all mounts to a power - house climax that will haunt you for days . "" Kalifonia "" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be , and not only for it`s violence and gore ."	1
I just saw this movie premiere on MTV . I must say this was extremely mediocre ( at its best ) . The dialogue does n't explain the story very well , and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes . There is n't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting . I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love . Also , Cate and Heath 's love seems very incestuous . They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers . I do n't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films , but like I said , it 's extremely hard to like any of the characters . Katherine Heigl 's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker . She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward , and there just was n't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance . Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky , he was the only person I sympathized with . As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel , they were supposed to be our heroines , but came off as whiny and overdramatic.I just did n't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it . There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band , MxPx , but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again . MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not . I just pictured something so completely different .	0
One of the great classic comedies . Not a slapstick comedy , not a heavy drama . A fun , satirical film , a buyers beware guide to a new home.Filled with great characters all of whom , Cary Grant is convinced , are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.A great look at life in the late 40's.<br / >	1
If you 're in the mood for some dopey light entertainment , this will pass the time . If you expect one jot of plausibility , do n't bother . To me , the dance scene looked like it was exaggerated for comic effect ; it did n't look especially hot or skilled .	0
1st watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 ( Dir - Sidney Franklin ) : Well told account of farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what Mother nature throws at them . This movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son 's arranged marriage to a slave girl . The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni . It chronicles , Wong Long(the character played by Muni ) and how he works the land , buys more land , eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started . The relationship between him and his wife , played by Luise Rainer , is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself ) and despite the obvious non - Chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it 's people . It 's obvious that MGM used it 's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it . The scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the Best Cinematography award at the Oscars in that year . The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it 's pulled off pretty well .	1
"Okay , let me break it down for you guys ... IT 'S HORRIBLE ! < br />If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this . I 'm sorry but this movie is stupid , true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic ... this movie a crock ! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The Shower scene * "" Kissing Cousins "" ? ? ? ? ? ? What kind of line is that ? "" Slipery when wet "" ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Can we say DUH - M ! This movie had effort , I 'll give you that , but it was too stupid ! They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually .... WASN'T FUNNY ! It was pathetic . Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast . It 's as if they made them look different on purpose or something ! I like watching it when I 'm really really really board which does n't happen occasionally . For those of you who did like it ... Okay , what were you thinking ? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar ? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it , DUH ! But this movie does n't , no offense Amy Adams . Oh , yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart ? ? ? ? ? UGH !"	0
"Considering the potential this move had , the reality was disappointing . While it 's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie , even that could n't turn this around . Most of the action was predictable . The jokes were flat to mildly amusing . And the characters were not very interesting . I wanted to like this film , but it just never happened . Ben Stiller was hilarious in "" There 's Something about Mary "" . Here it looks like he 's just going thru the motions . If they have to lift plot points from "" Friends "" , they should have known something was wrong . The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet : -).Watch "" 50 First Dates "" instead ."	0
Good exciting movie , although it looks to me that it 's not been recorded on location in Thailand , it still looks realistic . Nice story about some girls having ' fun ' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world . In real the Thai people are very kind .	1
"I never saw this when I was a kid , so this was seen with fresh eyes . I had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter . Plus , the idea of Christopher Walken singing and dancing made me curious . The special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre . But the story is great . My daughter was entranced . I loved watching Walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him . Very amusing to see him dance ! And if the songs were n't great , at least they were n't Disney over - produced saccharine sweetness . The ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her , and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end , but it was mostly benign . Interestingly , we had recently read "" Puss in Boots "" , and I had wondered about the implausibility of the story . But while staying true to almost every aspect , Walken 's acting made it believable . Great fun . I 'd watch it again with my daughter ."	1
The subject this latest adman - turned - movieman tries to tackle in his debut ( ad)venture is quite an age - old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance ( pun intended).However , the exploration ( and exploitation for Desi auds ) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to ' pepper , spice and sugar ' up the usual masala mix of b / g score , dialog , dance , drama , etc creates a nice - looking package with not much inside.In the first 40 minutes of the movie , the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8 - 9 times . Further repeats follow thru - out the movie ( after all the lead character 's a cook ) . But therein lies les problemos -- no story ! Hah , no wonder . Someone forgot to write a script.Amitabh puts in a Cheeni Jyada ( more ) amount of over - acting . Really when is this guy ever gon na stop ? ? How many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something ? ? ? Timeless mind yes , but surely what about the not - so - ageless bod ? And sole ? Sorry , soul ? ! Reasonably good acting by Paresh Rawal who has the only sensible role in the film . The director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new - fangled discovery of a hot new idea . Nowhere are we presented with any real - life problems or issues such a pair might face , other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle . The sub - plot of a little kid with cancer ( the bachelor boy 's first love ) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl 's character.Anyway , nice try but not quite there yet .	0
"Not sure if I 'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director ... ""Devil Hunter "" sure is one bizarre ' horror ' movie.The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like "" Cannibal Ferox "" and "" Cut and Run . "" Chick gets kidnapped in the ' jungle ' by a ' tribe ' of ' savages . ' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico . The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City - style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb . And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic . I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.To make matters worse , this film has ultra - minimal gore , no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis . Not fun . I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro - trash film ; this one just fell WAY short.2 out of 10 , kids ."	0
"A woman 's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive . The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement . Of course B - horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature . The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard . And the last twenty minutes of Brinke 's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch . The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful . Better watch "" Scalps "" or "" Alien Dead "" again . Of course I ai n't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray , but "" Haunting Fear "" is too dull to be enjoyable ."	0
"This is the one movie to see if you are to we d or are a married couple . The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion , infidelity , juggling work and family.The so called "" culture of death "" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think.A must see . I hope it gets distributed as it should.Congratulations on the cast and director.Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me !"	1
I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson 's trilogy came out , but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison . The pace of this movie is rushed , many important scenes from the book are left out , and there is little character development . The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over , which I found distracting . And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished . There are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch , and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter . Watch this one if you 're in a hurry and ca n't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy . But if you have n't read the book you 'll probably be confused , because there is a lot missing from this version . 4 out of 10 .	0

I actually like this movie even though I do n't fancy James Belushi very much . In this movie , you can actually see several big names on the rise , Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox namely ; Caine 's was already big of course . The plot in this movie is simple ; its just like that Sliding Door movie . It however was told in a light - hearted manner and I like the comedy moments in it . It made me trying to relive my own important moments in live , eg what if I 've taken that girl out for a movie , and not the other etc . It tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change . It also reminds us to be careful what we wish for . Life is not always as good on the other side as we think ; maybe , what we have now is the best for us , all things considered .	1
"Have I seen a worse movie ? Perhaps only "" Manos : The Hands of Fate "" dragged more than "" Dukes "" . I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point . Let 's touch on a few ... There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they do n't respond . He shrugs and moves on , since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he 's talking about ( nor do we ) . It was like the engine died and was restarted.The few times the General Lee flew through the air were n't even that exciting . Nothing I have n't seen on the TV Series.Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott . The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked . The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it ( although roughly ) . The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.Seann William Scott 's awful , horrendous accent ( or lack thereof).I hated Willie Nelson 's performance . Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing ? I wanted him to disappear.Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen . She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film . That 's telling you how horrible this movie is . She 's a goddess.During the climax of the film , I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County , starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices . A nuclear bomb would have sufficed.This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film , but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film.If only we could erase and start over ..."	0
Tim Krabbe is the praised author of ' Het Gouden Ei ' , a novel that was put on the screen twice ( ' Spoorloos ' and ' The Vanishing ' ) . One of the Dutch writer 's more recent works is ' De Grot ' , a psychological thriller about two totally different men , Egon and Axel , who meet at a youth camp and , surprising enough , become friends for dear life . Egon is a quiet , somewhat dull person , who spends his time studying and writing geography books . Axel , on the other hand , is a charismatic ' party - animal ' , a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday 's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . From the moment they meet , Axel has a strong influence on Egon , while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything ( such as reading thick books like Egon ) ; ultimately , Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself , which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.After having read the book last year , I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . In my opinion , the book suffers especially from the complex structure . While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people , the plot becomes more of a puzzle : the many episodes are not presented chronologically , so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . Because of this , the story feels surprisingly remote : you often need to know a character 's background to really care for him or her . Another complaint was the fact that the main characters , Egon and Axel , are a little stereotypical . Egon IS ' the ' dull intellectual , while Axel IS his exact opposite . In real life , such one - dimensional people rarely exist ; in books and films , they always seem to be there , taking away a lot of credibility.Despite all this , the film was a pleasant surprise , being much better than the book . The adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography , humour and acting : Fedja van Huet ( Egon ) is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting ( which is , in my opinion , the highest an actor can achieve ) . The drawbacks of the film , however , are the same as the book 's : mainly because the characters are one - dimensional , they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . Guess who wrote the script ? Indeed , Krabbe himself . It is obvious that this talented director ( that 's what the movie makes clear anyway ) is hampered by a deficient screenplay . Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.7/10	1
As a Pokémon fan I enjoyed this movie very much . It introduces new legendary Pokémon ( as each movie does ) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters . I however do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it(This includes MOST adults ) . Some of the lines were corny , but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to English . The animation was beautiful , although there were a couple parts that did not look good . And although the villain is kind of corny , I think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains , and I guarantee you that they are n't all like this one . Those who did not like it , I say to each his own , but Pokémon fans will love it .	1
"I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy films . A couple of them were n't bad . Modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty , so goody - two shoes movies like these rarely get praise < br />Nonetheless , I ca n't defend this movie either . You can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story . Watching this , you just shake your head ask yourself , "" how stupid can you get ? "" This is cornier than corny , if you know what I mean . It is so corny I can not fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour - and - a - half.The story basically is "" Andy "" ( Mickey Rooney ) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from New York City as if that was the ultimate . People were a lot more social - conscious in the old days . You 'd hear the term "" social - climber "" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life . It 's all utter nonsense , of course , and looks even more so today.However , it 's about as innocent and clean a story and series ( there were a half dozen of these Andy Hardy films made ) as you could find . Also , if you like to hear Judy Garland sing , then this is your ticket , as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into Andy 's heart . Oh man , I almost throw up even writing about this !"	0
"Let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well - loved and well - respected , not to say revered author , in order to draw attention to their home - movies out on DVD.Hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers , in fact lied about only to be revealed , finally , as ludicrously inept in every department , the fans of Wells and of his book have been after the blood of its Writer - Producer - Director since it appeared on DVD.Many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page . Particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for Film School students , since this "" film "" does not even use the basic grammar of scripting , editing , continuity , direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time . It is possible the Director did show up for the shoot . Certainly there was no - one present who knew even remotely what they were doing.An ongoing thread continues to evolve on this IMDb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their $ 9.00 outlay.Much was promised . Absolutely nothing was delivered . Except "" Monty Python Meets "" War of The Worlds "" with all the humour taken out.Indefensible trash . Just unbelievable.There are REAL independent film - makers out there to be checked out . People who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be.People could do worse than keep an eye on Brit film - maker Jake West 's "" Evil Aliens "" for example ."	0
"Arnold once again in the 80 's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives . But as the tag line says Arnold has yet to play ! The movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen , controlling every aspect of life through TV and a police state . It 's most popular game show is The Running Man , in which criminals are forced to survive against "" Stalkers "" that live to kill them.The movie opens with Ben Richards ( Arnold ) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress . He is ordered by his superiors to fire on them , refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison , in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help . The government blames Richards for the massacre earning him the name "" Butcher of Bakersfield "" . Eighteen months later Richards along with two friends William Laughlin ( Koto ) and Harold Weiss ( McIntyre ) breakout of a detention zone they worked in . They make their way to the underground , led by Mic ( Mick Fleetwood ) . Mic quickly identifies Richards as the "" Butcher of Bakersfield "" and refuses to help him , but his friend 's convince him otherwise . They want him to join the resistance , but he 'd rather go live with his brother and get a job . Soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name Amber Mendez ( Alonso ) has taken his apartment . Knowing who he is she wo n't help him , but he convinces her , but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.Meantime , The Running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill . Damon Killian ( Dawson ) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees Richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture . Richards refuses to play , Killian threatens to use his friends instead of him , so he signs the contract . You 'll love that part . But soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure Killian knows he 'll be back . The Runners begin to make there way through the Zones and fight characters that are memorable , Sub - Zero , Buzz Saw and many others . Eventually Richards is joined by Amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too . Together they find the underground and make there way back to Killian and give him a farewell send off.The running man is another one of Arnold 's great movies from the 80 's . The movie was apparently somewhat based on Stephen King 's book of the same name . Some have said that the book is better . I 'm sure it 's not and I do n't care anyway I loved the movie . As in all of Arnold 's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from Arnold and even Ventura gets a couple in . But without a doubt Richard Dawson is the standout in this film . Being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded . The whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you . Keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows , "" hate boat "" among others . Also the cast was great besides Arnold , Koto , and Alonzo do n't forget Professor Toru Tanaka , Jim Brown , Ventura and Sven - Ole ! With all the reality TV nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now , but I 'm sure the Hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the "" Evil Bush "" . The new DVD had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one . Some how the ACLU managed to get some of there communism into the DVD and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an Arnold movie of all things . Blasphemy ! Overall for any Arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80 's on him , you ca n't miss this . Its one of the first ones I saw back in the 80 's and it 's still great to this day . The futuristic world and humor are great . Overall 10 out 10 stars , definitely one of his best ."	1
Salvage is the worst so called horror film I 've ever seen . There is nothing remotely horrific about it . It does n't deserve to be in a genre so fine . First of all i do n't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie . If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it . Second : the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly . Third : the story sucks , its been used before , and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse . Read the summery on the back of the case , it reveals the whole story . I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it . I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name . All hail Anthony Perkins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0
The movie is great and I like the story . I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and Highlander ( silly movie ) . I just tell the truth , I like a reality hehe and also a true story : ) < br /><br / >	1
"Stifler , has finished running his naked mile and is now attending Beta House . Crazy stuff happens , people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water . The Naked Mile was a crap film , but I found it to be significantly better then Band Camp . It seems they 've gone back to what did n't work for them and it shows that they do n't care either . You can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly . Young teenage boys who like to see naked women , crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House , everyone else can pretty much look away.Star Wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it 's ahead of its time special effects . Lord of the Rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that dazzled the eye . The Matrix changed the way action and sci / fi films were made , specifically with the cutting edge special effects . With all the advancement in technology , we eagerly await the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor . Then comes American Pie : Beta House , which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do . When people have created spaceships , landscapes and creatures using CGI , Beta House decides to use this technology to create semen . Yes , the thing that creates life , the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white residue shoot across the room onto a teddy bear . Is this funny ? Disgusting ? Neither ? Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile , which is surprising considering the previous installments title . Does the film need it ? Of course not , does it ever advance the plot , does it ever ? Does it ever get a laugh ? Does it ever get young boys aroused ? Yes the women are beautiful , but if I am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno.The female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and does n't annoy the viewer , like previous girls have done in the series , but not once did I ever believe this character would ever do what she does . I 'm pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic . The American Pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world . None of the events in this film would ever happen , if they ever did then I need to attend this school IMMEDIATELY . Is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time ? Well it does n't , we are watching them have a good time , by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having.There is a "" Deer Hunter "" scene in the film , but to make it "" funny "" for today 's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen . Are you laughing yet ? Instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head , or face , they place the gun in their mouths . Are you on the floor laughing yet ? The first time we are introduced to Stifler 's roommate , he 's having sex with his girlfriend . Are you cheering at the nudity yet ? The film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house , but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house , but needing to perform certain tasks . Then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys . It goes a little "" Revenge of the Nerds "" on us for a bit and it seems out of place . I honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place.Most of the comedy seems forced for shock value . Even at the beginning with the Dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with . The joke is in there somewhere , I think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list , or it could have been that one of his son 's friend 's mother was on the list . Either one , it does n't work.I guess if you have n't guessed it yet , this film is not funny . Nor does it seem to be focused , the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for does n't shock . Skip this lame installment and any future ones as well . I do not know why I have seen all the entries in the series , but for some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes ."	0
Or at least one of the best . I think this is a very fun and very cool game for the N64 . Bowser is up to his usual shenanigans ( yeah it 's a dumb word but the only one I can think of ) and Mario must stop him again . This game is very fun to play , and contains lots of nostalgia to me . The only bad thing about it is the graphics , which are awful to today 's standards , but everything else is pretty good ( especially the little mini - games you can unlock ) It 's the second best N64 game ( the first best is Conker 's Bad Fur Day ) that I recommend to any Mario fan , or any fan of platform games . It beats out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day.9/10 or : A	1

"Gary Busey is the title character , Frank "" Bulletproof "" McBain , your standard - issue reckless maverick cop who 's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes ( 38 and counting ) , he never stops going after the bad guys.When a cutting - edge U.S. tank dubbed "" Thunderblast "" is driven across the border into Mexico , it 's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado ( Rene Enriquez ) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff ( Henry Silva ) , who 's aligned himself with Russian villains . The Army personnel involved are kept as prisoners , chief among them Devon Shepard ( Darlanne Fluegel ) , who happens to be McBain 's ex - girlfriend . McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission.Busey may not have the physical presence of say , someone like Schwarzenegger , who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type , but he 's a blast as a self- confident dude who 's quick with the wisecracks . Fluegel is a great female lead ; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt - kicking action babe . Enriquez , Silva , Juan Fernandez , and the always welcome William Smith ( as a Russian major ) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition . The supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors : L.Q. Jones , R.G. Armstrong , Thalmus Rasulala , Lincoln Kilpatrick , Mills Watson , Luke Askew , Danny Trejo , and Cary - Hiroyuki Tagawa.T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman supply the script , based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray . It 's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks : they know their material is absurd and cheesy , and just have fun throwing credibility out the window . Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire , explosions , and general all - out mayhem.""Bulletproof "" is good fun for the action fan who does n't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.7/10"	1
I 'm starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie . It 's the first time I 've tried doing that , but I 'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks . That 's not because it 's intense but because it 's bad.It 's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable , especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan ( Colm Feore ) is on screen being tragic and bitchy , self - indulgent and self - pitying . This would have been a much better movie if they 'd just left that character out of the story.He adds nothing but mawkish , maudlin , very irritating melodrama . Maybe somebody decided that if they could n't make Ryan believable they 'd just make him obnoxious . The problem with that is : Who cares if a spoiled , whining , obnoxious jerk is dying ? Not me.The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he 's dying , and sorry , but that 's just not enough . Dying does n't make anybody special . We 're ALL dying , sooner or later . It does n't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.The other two characters , and the actors playing them ( David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah ) , are very much more interesting , and their story , without Ryan 's self - pitying interruptions , would have made a much better movie . But it 's not over yet , and it 's time to hit PLAY again . Maybe something great happens before the end .... Nope . Sorry . This rented turkey goes back tonight !	0
"I 'm tired of people judging films on their "" historical accuracy "" . IT 'S A MOVIE PEOPLE ! ! The writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story ! There are a number of movies out there that are n't entirely accurate with the history .... Braveheart , Wyatt Earp , Gangs of New York , Geronimo : An American Legend , The Last of the Mohicans .... all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically . If you want to see a few great actors do what they do best , then I suggest you see this film and do n't worry about the accuracy of the facts . Just enjoy the quality of the film , the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time ."	1
"This wartime sitcom written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft , who wrote TV 's best programme ever Dads Army , was not as good as Dads Army , but still very , very funny.It is about A concert band in India . Most episodes were about BSM Williams ( Windsor Davies ) trying to get the concert party , who he referred to as a bunch of puffs , posted up the jungle . He was always unsuccessful as the vague Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and the stupid Captain Ashwood ( Michael Knowles ) were big fans of the concert party . The concert party consisted of Bombadier Solomans ( George Layton ) , Ginger Rogers impersonator Gunner "" Gloria "" Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ) , University educated piano player Gunner "" La de da "" Gunner Graham , a.k.a Padarouski ( John Clegg ) , singer Gunner "" Lofty "" Sugden , Gunner Parkins ( Christopher Mitchell ) ( Williams thought Parkins was his son , he was quite wrong ) , big eater Gunner "" Nosher "" Evans and animal impersonator 's ( Kenneth MacDonald ) , he was no Percy Edwards . Also , heavily involved in the adventures were faithful Indian servant Rangi Ram ( Michael Bates ) , with the Char - Wallah and the Punkah - Wallah ( Dino Shafeek and Babar Bhatti ) giving Ram wonderful support . < br />The show , just like Dads Army left many catchphrases . Rangi Ram used to say to his Punkah Wallah "" Do n't be such clever dickie "" and he ended a lot of the shows saying "" Here is a very old Hindu Proverb e.g When wife is having affair with best friend , it does n't stop your house from catching fire "" It was Williams though who had the most catchphrases . He would always shout "" Shuddup ! ! ! ! ! "" , say "" Oh dear , how sad , never mind "" and when talking to Gunner Graham , he would always sarcastically talk in a posh accent.This show does n't enjoy the same recognition as Dads Army did . This is probably due to a question of taste : This is seen as being crude . Williams is homophobic calling his men "" Puffs "" , though it has to be said Williams is a bore . Also , some people think there is a racial element in the humour , using the fact that Michael Bates was blacked up to play Rangi Ram ( Bates was actually born in India though and spoke Urdu before he spoke English ) , so the BBC will feel a bit uneasy putting it on , even though the vast majority of people who have actually WATCHED the show would agree that the show is n't racist , I know someone who is half Indian , and they were n't the slightest bit offended and agreed like I did that it was a very funny show . When I see an episode for the first time , I laugh probably more than I do for any other sitcom , but when I see it second time round , I do n't laugh all that much , but no matter how many times I see Dads Army , I laugh many times in an episode.Best Episode : The Road to Banu , series 1 , episode 7"	1
One of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out . If I had n't been with my wife , who wanted to stay , I would have left . It 's a shame , too , because I think it could have been a good movie . But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I 've ever seen . It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere ( I would say it goes nowhere fast , but it really goes nowhere slow ... painfully slow ) . From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen , or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters , but that 's all we get - hints . There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie . Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained ... I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff . But these characters add up to nothing . For the entire duration of the film you do n't care what happens to a single one of them . As a matter of fact , you almost start hoping they die , because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior , which is so strange and unpredictable that you 'd think it in itself would be compelling , but it 's not . Instead of quirky , noir - esquire characters acting in hard - boiled fashion , you simply recognize it immediately for what it is : a bunch of talented but miscast actors , brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context . All this for two plodding , painfully slow hours . Awful .	0
Here , on IMDb.com I read an opinion , that Grey Owl is best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed . I do not know if he had better nor worse roles , I 'm not his fan , but this one was really exceptional.The other thing - impressive hand of the movie director . I give my respect . The serenity , the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively , I never met such proximity it in any movie before.Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie , closest to the original books , and atmosphere in it . < br />And little bit more . I pay my respect to the original Grey Owl .	1
"This movie is about a Dysfunctinal Family but Not just any Dysfunctional Family . It is about the Family of the Father of our Nation ( India ) although , the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi . It shows how The Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi , how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom . Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son would try to get close the Mahatma would come between them . This is a beautifully done film . Akshaye Khanna has proved himself to be a Top Actor . He expressed emotions very naturally . Darshan Jariwala who mainly stars in Plays - Gurukant Desai 's lawyer in Guru has portrayed Gandhi wonderfully.(as a real Human Being , unlike Ben Kingsley who made him look like a God ) Shefali Shah the girl from Monsoon Wedding has also done a really good job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son . This Movie is touching and so is its soundtrack "" Raghupati Raghava "" sung in a very unique manner . I saw this movie just 3 hours ago(it released in Dubai a day earlier - on the 2nd ) and when the movie was over there was "" Pin Drop Silence "" and while exiting out of the Theatre not ONE person pushed another ( Can you imagine us Indians not pushing ? ) NOT ONE ! There was a Sacred Silence ..."	1
I rented this film about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night . All I can say to describe this worthless film is ' TRASH ' The acting is so badly done I 've seen kids in high school do a better job The whole cast seems like they 're just reading their lines out , no feeling , no emotion , and no room to capture the viewer . On another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.The clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover . Heck he does n't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters . There is no real murder shown either so this is n't a real slasher film either Since I 've seen it I 've questioned a few things 1 . If is ' Serial Insane Clown Killer ' Would n't that be a Serial Killer who kills clowns ? 2 . If your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her ? Sad really.3 . Why is it that the only REAL acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden ? Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs ? This film is as sad as they come . My advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming .	0
This film has a special place in my heart , as when I caught it the first time , I was teaching adult literacy . It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time . There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion , and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation . < br />Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work , a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton , an inspiring story line , and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience .	1
This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time . It has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse , a weary middle - aged cop Corrigan ( Walter Kinsella ) and his rookie sidekick Tobin ( John Miles ) , a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the Tobin in the shape of a female botanist Mary ( Patricia Wright ) who helps solve the crime . There 's also a terrific shoot - out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard.Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt . Corrigan refers to the dead woman as ' Tatooed Tilly ' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo ( confusing huh ? ) . Also later when Tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did n't catch him !	1
This one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans , but I thought it was wonderful . It 's an episodic multi - character study of Tokyo 's poorest , who live in a city literally made from garbage . Though it looks like an A - Bomb just hit , the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor . The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum . All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing , but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car . When not searching for food , they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house . An emotionally moving and beautiful film .	1
I got this movie in the $ 5 bin at walmart . I would not recommend watching this move . I might give it to one of my friends if I am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.I looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie . I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on . It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie . It 's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another . The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.Okay , here is my rant about this movie : To me , this movie is slow and hard to watch . It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end . It does n't . After the movie was over I through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it , and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it .	0
I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of , and those I found made this one look unmissable . How misled I feel!Firstly , it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife 's daytime movie . The performances are wooden , every sentence is an attempt at ' poignant ' in the way that housewife 's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are , and it is based in that predictable and well - trodden premise that men ( particularly soldiers ) are essentially violent and incompassionate . The whole movie is about the ' drama ' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.If that sounds tolerable ( or even enjoyable ) to you , then be warned . Linda Hamilton 's German accent , while quite good , is painfully distracting - as is her face , for some reason . The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators , with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day . There are few surprises , but do watch for the ' Monty Pythonesque ' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers ' knapsacks!I was n't expecting action , but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged . What I got was a particularly bad Christmas ' feelgood ' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.Watch it under the folowing circumstances : 1 : There 's nothing else on . 2 : You are a fan of predictable ' housewife takes on men and wins ' TV movies . 3 : The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film . 4 : You 've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling .	0
"No day passes without a new released computer animated movie , so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects . After watching Ice Age I felt that 's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.But it 's because I am a Big Guy now , and I am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children ( maybe up to 14 ) . The story is quite simple , and the "" actors "" are funny in a cute way , without any crude or complex humour . Even the "" evil "" is lovely , fluffy big cat with those funny teeth . And the story has a happy end , which was a small disappointment for me ( knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way ) but a great thing for children . And apart from some fights nobody dies ( not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth , several times ) , which made a cartoony feeling.The computer animation part is nice but nothing special , apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes , when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics . [ Which means lots of work nevertheless!]There were some gags which made me smile - I accept , the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and ( in my opinion ) better left unnoticed , since it does not feel to fit into the story.Overall it 's a nice movie , but it 's rather in the ideal - world - and - fluffy - animals - for - children disney cliche . If you do n't hate cute animals making funny things , watch it at least once ."	1
Space Camp is a pretty decent film . The plot is predictable , but the actors do a good job , and the special effects are decent for the time.This film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster , and that really put a hamper on how popular it was.The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen , that is ... on a TV ... it just looks average . I remember this scene in the theater . It made you feel like you were really up there.This would be a good film to see on IMAX , but I 'm sure that will never happen .	1
Like another reviewer said , this movie is not a heavy melodrama , but it deals with harsh realities . A very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment . Some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well .	1
"This is the weepy that Beaches never was . As much as I wanted to love Beaches , it always seemed too hurried for me to "" feel "" for it ( its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though ) . Stella , on the other hand , moves at a slower ( and occasionally too slow ) pace and though it 's somewhat manipulative in its tears - inducing tale about a self - sacrificial mother , it works because Bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances . 10/10"	1
Dan Duryea , a perfectly decent B - movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s , ca n't do much with this one : young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer ; when he 's sentenced to die , his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman 's husband . After a dazzling opening shot , flick quickly settles into B - movie formula . It certainly looks good , but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast ( including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford ) is just a bit stiff . Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel , and passable for a single viewing . < br /><br / > * * from * * * *	0

"This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl on her own . The realism and subtle nuances , offered to Ashley Judd 's character , Ruby , by the storyline , capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of Florida . From the slam of a screen door , to the lack of work , the echoes of what life is really like on the "" red - neck riviera "" provide rough choices for the young girl . Paradise did not come easy . But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit , and learns to be her own woman , with a strength that flows from within . Ashley Judd 's winning smile , and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration . The careful pace of the character development resembles that of "" Ulee 's Gold "" in 1997 , starring Peter Fonda , and also directed by Victor Nunez ."	1
I saw the description of the movie on TCM and only let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith , so I was delightfully surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional . Of course , it is seriously dated , but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago . Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often . I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads , and of Karl Malden , Bob Newhart , and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero .	1
"From around the time Europe began fighting World War II , until the war 's end , Hollywood ( with significant prodding from the government ) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army , by making the life of a serviceman appear "" cool . "" This is by far the sloppiest , implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work , you get the best food , and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio . I am far too young to have participated in WWII , but I think that there was more to it than that . There is the barest cat 's whisker of a plot , and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day 's leading acts.I think that by 1943 , even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie . While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment , I ca n't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war , were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones ' sacrifice ."	0
"It 's a testament to Gosha 's incredible film - making prowess that he was able to complete both Hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , Goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . And it 's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great Akira Kurosawa ) , that both Hitokiri and Goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the Tosha clan and their boss Takechi , played by another genre stalwart , Tatsuya Nakadai . The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the flailing Shogunate . The historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with Japan 's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the Tokugawa and the pressure by the West to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . It helps a lot to know a thing or two about Japanese history and what eventually led to the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the Tokugawa Shogunate , but it 's not essential by any means . The movie was made primarily for a Japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.As one would expect from a Hideo Gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60 's ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . Style however is never decorative for Gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . < br />And speaking of story , Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character Izo Okada . As most chambara protagonists , Izo finds himself in a moral double - bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . In the first half of the movie Izo is trying for social self - advancement . Lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat 's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer 's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century Japan . < br />The turning point for Izo is when he realizes at what cost self - advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . It is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the Tosha Clan to a "" nameless "" drifter without past or future , Torazo the Vagrant . Although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in Yojimbo 's mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self - dillusion that allows Izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . < br />Hitokiri ends ( which I wo n't reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives Izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death ."	1
"No matter what anyone tells you , there is a mere fact to the word "" possession "" in film circles -- such as "" what possessed you to greenlight this film ? "" Religion does n't have anything to do with it , but common sense does . That is , if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment.On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain .... or even interest the average consumer . The star ? The story ? The unique idea ? A buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman ? On , my goodness ! I am sure when this was an "" idea "" , it sounded good . But somewhere during the course of development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for ... unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see.Regardless , this is a complete mess .

"The first two - thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting . Betty , as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol , comes across as a pleasant , girl - next - door type , who saw nothing wrong with what she did ( and there certainly was n't anything "" wrong "" with it ) . Director Mary Harron , who also made "" I Shot Andy Warhol "" and "" American Psycho "" , recreates Betty 's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new , degraded , black and white footage . Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager , color is introduced . Betty 's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw ( Lili Taylor , in a great performance , and Chris Bauer ) , as well as John Willie ( Jared Harris ) . The scenes where Harron recreates Betty 's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed . The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight "" community "" . Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety , although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world . Because the film 's third act is virtually non - existent , we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama . Flaws aside , it 's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon ."	1
"After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie - goers . There are the ones who are well read , extremely literate , and intelligent . They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author . For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature . Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre - pubescent teenagers . Today 's well read fan knows well this history , and knows the great authors Asimov , Heinlein , Bradbury , and Ellison , who helped bring science fiction out of that basement . In doing so they created thought provoking , intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition . This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them . They are not critical for it 's own sake , but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye . ( As they should as Hollywood 's record has been less than stellar . ) To these fans the story must take supreme importance . They can not be fooled by flashy computer graphics , and non stop action sequences . When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre . ( Look at many of the above comments that state "" Well I have n't read the book or anything by this author ... ) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel . They are extremely uncritical , willing to overlook huge plot holes , weak premises , and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects . They are , in effect , willing to turn off their critical thinking skills ( or maybe they never had them ! ) for the duration of the movie . Case in point , I Robot . While supposedly based on Asimov 's short stories and named after one of his novels , it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations . ( Those of you that will run out and buy I , Robot will be very much surprised - this movie is n't even based on that story at all ! ) < br />The film has enormous plot holes , that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity . I wo n't point them out . I wo n't spoon feed you . You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself . The characters , which are named after many of Asimov 's characters , do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories . The plot itself with all it 's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for . His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds , not their fists , is vital to understanding his vision of the future . In short , other than the name , their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie . There will always be those uncritical ( i.e. unthinking ) who will state : "" The movie does n't have to be like the book . Due to the medium , movies sometimes require that changes be made . "" But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book ( or books ) from the start ? What if all they took from the written work was the title ? This begs the question : Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it 's title on your vacuous piece of crap ? Save money and do n't buy the rights to the works . Title it something else . Do n't use the character 's names . Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism . In fact it wo n't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him . But it will upset those who read , who think , who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show . < br />I , Robot , like much of Hollywood 's take on the genre , pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago . Hollywood could not do this alone . It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this ."	0
Peter Sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York , or Loisaida , as it 's known by the locals.Mr . Sollett 's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family , that is typical of the different ' inner cities ' of the country . Mr. Sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents . These are basically good kids , the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing . < br />Instead of presenting his characters as losers , Mr. Sollett shows a positive side they all have . These kids are not into drugs , or are stealing because they are poor . Had this story been done by Hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes , instead of children that are struggling , but deep down inside , they are not defeated.Victor Rasuk , as Victor Vargas , was a revelation . He is a natural . So is July Marte . Her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she does n't want to do . Altagracia Guzman , as the grandmother is excellent . She conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her . < br />All in all , this was an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett .	1
"Really , I liked it . The premise was good , the story fit where both respective series left off , and here 's my favorite part . Mary and Valerie are n't bitter ! They are n't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it , or do possible reunions ( A prime example is Susan Dey , "" The Partridge Family "" ) . In fact , Valerie was saying that she 'd be thrilled to do another movie , and then Mary said the same thing later , so I would be on the look for another ... but if that does n't quite work out , then they can re - run this one ."	1
What the heck was this . Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester . We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror . There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music , CGI , or acting.The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy . Even David Lynch 's work feels like that at times , and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long . And sadly this is only 98 minutes.The cast was attractive , and that is about the limit to this . I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have , but just does n't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates ... whatever they were . The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous .	0
When I saw the preview , I thought : this is going to be a great movie . And indeed it could have been . The actress playing the main character was very credible , and the beauty of the filming is undeniable . However the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture . The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 , and it took away most of the magic of the film . However , I must congratulate the translator , because the English sub - titles were more refined and appropriate that the original French cues , and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd !	0
I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds . But this movie I enjoyed , mostly because I 'm used to the usual HK action films . Most of the films like this are do n't watch it for the story line , watch it for the mindless action . And mindless action is right . You get to see Jet Li Jump , spin , kick , punch , shoot , make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets . It 's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 . That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped . Most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a North American film . But you need to remember most HK film budgets are n't nearly as high as a North American film , and the style in a HK action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them . If you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.My rating was an 8 .	1
It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience , to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . However , this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) . Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . This film might have been more , as there was suitable budget for settings , actors and a decent story line . My wife and I both agreed that this was ' Muck ' at the end , as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high ! Better luck next time , hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell .	0
Very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty - row film company PRC who usually put out really cheesy films like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT . German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio - bound swamp set . Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton is effective as the Strangler .	1
"I wondered why I did n't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did , when it first came out in 1986 , with all the hype . Somehow I found Nic Cage 's character off - putting . Way off - putting . Then the plot did n't seem to make sense . Then by the end of the credits , the question came to mind : What point was this movie making ? What was it saying ? The answer , unfortunately , was not much , if anything . I really do n't think this movie aimed at making a statement ; unless it was "" your life is your life , you 're gon na make the same mistakes no matter what , so keep your eye upon the doughnut , and not the hole "" . Not a very profound statement , and I 'm sorry , not profoundly made in this movie . The writing simply is n't that good . The direction is uneven , and is strangely overblown at times . Kathleen Turner was the best , and in my opinion , only worthwhile thing in this movie , and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre , unexplained circumstances , with a script that had no apparent statement to make . < br />She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I did n't enjoy this movie more . She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola 's direction every step of the way , doing it "" his own way "" ( not a good idea for a new actor ) , and putting on a goofy voice she called "" stupid "" . His voice was annoying , abrasive and unnatural , and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy . I understand what he was attempting to do : play a young - guy "" hot shot "" who is not as hot as he thinks he is , setting up his own karma for future failure . But he goes overboard , the way he does it is abrasive , not effective , and if he had listened to his uncle instead of "" fighting the Man "" , we would have had a more enjoyable film . Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person , and those scenes are more watchable than others . But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety , I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected ( put - on ) scenes . < br />The movie does n't aim for a statement , does n't make a point , is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression ( but without the voice ) , and is , ultimately , confusing and a waste of time . Given all this , Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie . I ca n't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this , unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes . Believe me , you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes , and it will make just as much sense . < br />Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments , which proves that she 's strong enough to be honest , and to hell with other people 's comments . You go , Turner ! I 'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first - rate actor or actress , but her candor is refreshing . Cage 's acting can be good to annoying , and here it does n't work . At least , in this film , now we know why ."	0
"Generically speaking , Fay Grim is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in American movies , unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky Parker Posey and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious Jeff Goldblum . They have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other , even radiating with charm when Goldblum rolls off Hartley 's shamelessly epic info - dumps . Nevertheless , if one were to deconstruct Fay Grim , one would see many instances in which countless scenes could 've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being.This sort of filmed in - joke is the sequel to Hal Hartley 's Henry Fool , which was made ten years earlier . It has title character Posey forced by CIA agent Goldblum to track down the notebooks that were the precious possessions of her missing fugitive husband , the predecessor 's titular anti - hero . Available within them is information that could concede the safety of the United States . Fay first makes for Paris to get a hold of them but becomes engulfed in a bona fide celebration of espionage clichés featuring everything from car bombs to ambiguous helpers to Following the Girl to double - crosses to triple - crosses.The primary appeal of it all for me is that it 's such a novel approach to the sequel of a movie about a garbageman and a struggling novelist in a small town . In the original Henry Fool , Posey played a simple woman leading a very simple life . Hartley 's talents do not reach the heights of many of the other independent newbies from the 1990s , but I do admire his wild creativity in making an inadvertent Nearne sister out of her , giving her a terrific predicament , as he did to her character 's brother , played by James Urbaniak , in Henry Fool , as she is trapped between whether or not she may still love her overwhelming refugee husband and the problematic but forceful plans of Goldblum.Hartley , however , is simply riding on that fragmentary idea . His plot , though complex and labyrinthine , true to the form of the spy film , it seems as if to be entirely capricious . The reason I was not bored was mostly due to the pace at which the story unfolds , not to mention the presence of Posey and Goldblum . The problem with the remainder of Hartley 's cast is that I can not seem to become fond of the rest of them . It has nothing to do with how obscure they are compared to the relative star power of the two said charm masters , but with how they do n't seem to hold their own alongside them , though Saffron Burrows certainly comes close . Most of the scenes not involving Posey or Goldblum are far too light on their feet , stringing us along with info - dumps we have no choice but to listen to or else be totally lost in the ensuing sequence of scenes . They are shot almost entirely in tiled angles , as if Hartley is compensating for that implacable feeling of a lack of material.Liam Aiken , however , playing the now teenage son of Fay and Henry , has a certain allure about him , seeming wise beyond his years , certainly much wiser than any of the adult characters . Perhaps Hartley intended that , or maybe it 's simply Aiken 's presence . The problem with a Hartley film is that you never quite know what was intended and what just happens to be there . As Scorsese said , "" Cinema is a matter of what 's in the frame and what 's out . "" One has to be able to trust that what we see is a conscious decision by the filmmaker to remain in the finished film ."	1
First of all , do n't go into Revolver expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock , this is a different sort of gangster film.I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience . It 's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking WHAT was that ? That was awful , and the other half will leave thinking WHAT was that ? That was cool . Personally i like films that i do n't understand , i.e . Mullholland Drive , and Usual Suspects , so i enjoyed Revolver . < br />It definitely was n't perfect though . I saw the big twist coming a mile away , at least part of it , and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good , Revolver leaves A LOT of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed . Also some scenes , like the animation , and the scene where Sorter goes on a killing spree(actually one of my favourites ) , although , awesome scenes to watch , seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch , not because they fit in with the movie.However there were many good things too . I thought the acting was superb from all the main actors , Jason stratham , Ray Liotta , Vincent Pastore , and even Andre Benjamin(who was a pleasant surprise ) . This movie definitely kept my interest , with one great , suspenseful , action packed , scene after another . When Ray Liotta was being held under the table wow .... well you have to see it . The script was extremely well done , and the soundtrack , as with most Guy Ritchie films , was great.Though a step below such movies as , Fight Club , Mullholland Drive , and Usual Suspects , it was still an awesome fast paced , psychological , action movie , with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .	1
"I had watched "" The Eye "" before I watched this one . I really liked "" The eye "" , it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror - cinema . So , I picked this "" Bangkok haunted "" because it was the same director , and it was kind of popular round here . But man , what a disappointment ... "" Bangkok haunted "" are three stories about love , revenge , ghosts , etc . that are no scary at all , not even disturbing ( as "" The eye "" was ) ... no nothing . I ca n't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment ... < br />100 % boring.*My rate : 2/10"	0
"With a title like that , it 's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me . Granted , there 's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore , but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse "" shock "" tactics ... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road . He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods . He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement . The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her , a "" grabby "" neighbor , and her sexually abrasive boss . He explains to her that he is going to kill them all . She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men ( or pigs ) whom she tortures and kills , herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild . The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man - rape ... Surely , "" I Spit on Your Corpse , I P!ss on Your Grave "" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "" I Spit on Your Grave "" - based on , mainly the title , and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton . I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion ! This movie is a boring , amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably ..."	0
I have just finished watching this film and I can honestly say that this is a work of art . I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2.Not only does Guy bring together a b list(ish ) movie cast and make them into such glorious characters , he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination.Far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate ... yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable.This film is special . Get it , now !	1
"This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them . It 's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you always find a new detail . As in Sabu 's subsequent movies ( I did n't see "" Unlucky monkey "" yet , but the other ones are as great ) failure , chance and humanism play great roles . The cutting and Montage is inventive and artistic , without the movie being an "" art "" picture , but a highly entertaining one . When comparing it to "" Run , Lola , Run "" you have to keep in mind that "" Dangan Ranna "" was made some years before and was shown on German TV as early as 1997 ... so it 's more probable that it served as inspiration for Tom Tykwer 's movie , and not the other way around . Complementary to the other reviews I have to add that I like the acting and the ending very much . This movie is a lot of fun in many ways , and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious ."	1
"One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Was n't There by director Brian Flemming , an ex - Christian Fundamentalist . Flemming , in his 62-minute documentary , asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions . Using interviews with authors , philosophers , and historians to debunk the long - held Christian belief that Jesus , the son of God , lived among men , was crucified , and was resurrected , Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt , Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology , and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities.In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults , he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story , the four gospels , were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus ' crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure . Flemming , unfortunately however , is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus ' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion . Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price . The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher , the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com , and Ronald Sipus , principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School , which Flemming attended as a boy.Like Michael Moore 's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine , his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle . In a sarcastic tone , Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth , then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser , who cut her baby 's arm off for God . He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians "" look forward to the day when all non - Christians are thrown into a lake of fire , howling and screeching . "" To further turn us against Christianity , Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ , detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture . What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion . In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts , he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester , a famous Christian pacifist , Rigoberta Menchú Tum , a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice , and Mother Teresa , whose work was about respect for each individual 's worth and dignity.His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points , yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines , there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD , long after the New Testament . Also it is important to note one major difference . The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god . This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God 's will to mankind.Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure , the truth is that , in the long scheme of things , it may not matter . What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind 's spiritual evolution . Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many , Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love , and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man.While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed , what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world 's people together . While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects , in the words of Annie Besant , "" spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect . The God Who Was n't There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others ."	0
"This is truly terrible : painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose , no beginning , middle or end , cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention , all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable "" story "" . What makes it worse is the film 's pretentions to "" style "" : suddenly a remote - head crane shot spirals downwards , and , without any apparent reason there are sudden whip - pans or wobblyhand - held sections : all this "" style "" merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material . Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made ."	0
Its not Braveheart ( thankfully),but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around . I enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week , find it has held up well over time . Not a classic film , but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment .	1
"Had this been the original 1914 version of TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY ( also starring Mary Pickford ) , I probably would have rated it a lot higher , as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens . However , by 1922 , this film was already starting to show its age . And , compared to many of Ms. Pickford 's other films ( such as DADDY LONGLEGS , SPARROWS , MY BEST GIRL and SUDS ) , TESS comes up a tad short -- and not every Pickford film merits a 10 ( even if she was "" America 's Sweetheart "" ) . Now this is n't to say that it 's a bad film -- it certainly is n't . But , I just ca n't see how so many have given this film a 10.The film has a very long and complicated plot -- especially because most films of the era were shorter . A rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river . At the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he can not evict . So he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land . One ends up in tragedy , when his daughter 's fiancé is killed in a scuffle with the po ' folks . The man accused of the murder is dear old Mary 's father , though he is innocent . To make things a lot worse , the only witness to the real murder wo n't talk AND the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant ! So , at this point , we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is "" in the family way "" . There 's a ton more to the film , such as the crank 's son falling in love with Mary , but it 's best you just see the film for yourself.The film excels in some ways . The plot , while very complicated , is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top - notch . The very final scene is also pretty cute . However , there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife . Mary is SO good and SO sweet and So plucky , at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take . While it worked great in 1922 ( making her the biggest star in the world ) , today it 's very dated . This is NOT true of all her films , but this one certainly is.By the way , the Image Entertainment DVD is of decent quality , though a few scenes are badly degraded -- something that is n't very surprising considering the age of the film . Also , the only extras included are a brief filmography ."	1
"I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it . Well , I ca n't imagine anyone liking this movie because it 's just bad , bad , bad.It 's obvious that whoever made this movie does n't know a single thing about horror . The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres : action movie ( guns and criminals ) and horror ( living scarecrows ) . When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows , the two genres automatically cancel each other out because , first , they 're criminals and who cares about criminals , and second , because they 're stupid criminals to boot ! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does n't work here . Where 's the horror in that ? I wanted the criminals to die horrible , painful deaths.But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres , which could have been original if handle well , NEVER gels . We 're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows , which are "" alive "" for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up . Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible ( TV like ) and , worse offense of all , whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs , and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we 're watching some sort of Radio show . This part was really BAD . The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea ! I ca n't tell you how annoying that was.As I 've already mentioned , the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid . For instance , when someone suddenly shows up , gutted and filled with money and straw ( yep , straw ) in his huge open wound , the others ask "" What drug is he on ? "" after they shoot tons of bullets in him , unable to kill him ( he 's been "" zombiefied "" by the scarecrows . Do n't ask ... ) . Get a freaking clue , morons . I 've never seen such stupid people in a movie . And then there 's the girl . I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt . When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow "" cross "" , she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene ( bad acting ) , even though the criminals could n't have done it . What a dimwit she was ! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick . They 're not scary . Nothing much is explained about them . They 're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie.Mr Wesley , filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop does n't elicit anything but sheer boredom . And that scene with the talking head in the fridge . Thanks for the laughter.All in all , this had to be one of the worst movies I 've seen recently ( and I 've seen a lot of movies these days ! ) Between the equally woeful SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS , I 'd rather watcher SILO KILLER again . Yep , SCARECROWS is that bad ."	0
"OK , OK , do n't get bent out of round . I was kidding.""Bustin ' Out "" is actually a better and truer title anyhoo.Racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our X - rated animator friend Ralphie boy . And he does one of his better jobs here.On the crime front it shows the truth . They build it , defend it , then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to ( maybe ) lose it . See for yourself to see what goes down.Racist ? I do n't know . With Scatman ( RIP ) and the love walrus ( also RIP ) being black and the main point of view , I saw it as an attack on racism mostly . The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says as much as well . And the younger ( pre "" Miami Vice "" ) Phil Mike Thomas in there was a nice surprise.It 's an animated "" Blacksploitation "" film . That 's a good thing . Done well and well done . It will make some squirm ( like the lynching scene ) but unfortunately that 's based on fact.But Ralphie REALLY should have re - thought that title ."	1
"I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb . But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone 's been fixing the score.Either way it was a real disappointment . The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes : it felt like someone had been thinking : "" Would n't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane ? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff ? ! ? "" And that 's about it ! The plot is thin and unoriginal . The snakes are bad CGI ( but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone ! ) . The acting is poor , and all people are unbelievable stereo types.To sum it up : It 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen - stay away !"	0
"Every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener ca n't stand or never watched all the way through . This is the movie that I think of ... days later.It 's got something to do with a play by Shakespeare . Not sure , but I think I bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it ... think I realised that my toenails would n't clip themselves , and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut.This movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me.Even though this is the first movie I 've given such a low score to ( which I 've actually attempted to watch ) , I would n't want to put you off other movies by it 's English director , Peter Greenaway . I remember thinking that his "" The cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" was a truly great British film even though its content was at times stomach churning - a brilliant movie , but I can understand why people would balk at seeing it.Another good film by Greenaway was "" A zed and two noughts "" . Again , it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste , but was intriguing nonetheless.The other film that I usually think of too late for such radio show topics is "" Brazil "" . Never managed to watch that all the way through either - kept falling asleep!Unless you have a taste for self - important movies which are off - puttingly highly stylised , laboriously paced and difficult to follow , then steer clear of Prosero 's Books ."	0
"It does seem like this film is polarizing us . You either love it or hate it . I loved it.I agree with the comment(s ) that said , you just got ta "" feel "" this one.Also , early in the film , Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet -- an impressionist painter . Monet 's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess , but from a distance , you can tell what the subject is . Cruise mentions that the painting has a "" vanilla sky "" . I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer . This movie is like that impressionist painting . It 's impressionist filmmaking ! And it 's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.This is not your typical linear plot . It requires more thought . There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no , you 're not always going to be sure what 's going on . But at the end , all is explained.You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it . After it ends is when you should think about it . If you try to figure it out as it 's unfolding , you will overwhelm yourself . Just let it happen ... ""go "" with it ... keep an open mind . Remember what you see and save the analysis for later.I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique , wildly creative , and spellbinding.But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who did n't enjoy it . It appeals to a certain taste . If you like existential , psychedelic , philosophical , thought - provoking , challenging , spiritual movies , then see it . If you prefer something a little lighter , then skip it.But if you DO like what I described , then you will surely enjoy it ."	1
The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and was n't intended to be a sequel to Demons as Lamberto Bava even mentions it on the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD , but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series . The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80 's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror Demons III : The Ogre is a architectural horror so that 's how Demons III is n't a proper sequel to Demons but I still like this film.The music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in , The Ogre is another thing why I like the film . There are two other films that are classed as Demons III and that is Black Demons ( Demoni 3 ) and The Church ( Demons 3 ) . Demons III : The Ogre is a good film as long as you do n't compare it with Demons and Demons 2 .	1
I 've been disappointed , if not surprised , at the lack of appreciation this film has received . Once again , Billy Zane proves he 's more than just a Hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance that combines spastic slapstick with understated pathos . Calling this a silent film is inaccurate , as there 's a lot of music and sound . It has a manic pace and is full of the goofy inventiveness that Ed Wood is finally beginning to be appreciated for . Look at the cast listing , and realize that everyone shines . No one is there just to show their face . I believe they 're all in the movie to show their appreciation of Wood , and to do a broad , physical kind of acting not seen much these days.But , today , reviewers try to guess what 's going to become a hit much more than they show any kind of esthetic appreciation for a movie . And IWUETDID has no discernable target audience . It was made mostly out of love for Wood 's script . Even after his death , the trendy social parasites have dealt him another serious blow , and deprived the world of a minor classic . This is a highly entertaining and a genuinely experimental film that really deserves to live , at least on DVD .	1
"One thing i can say about this movie is well long , VERY LONG ! I actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out . I was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because The 70 's ( even though i never lived in them ) is actually one of my favourite decades , especially for the music ! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive . i will admitt the animation did impress me ! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see . but the movie honestly could of been a bit better , it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting . then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly . in my opinion i thought it was EXTREMELY long . i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie , it made it seem like it was 4 hours long ! ! ! ! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those "" nothing to do days "" . i will see the new one and i hope it is better !"	1
Truly amazing film , the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening . A world vastly overpopulated , unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer , and all our natural resources spent . In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder , opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance.One of the images that will always stay with me from this film , is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne ( Heston ) has to hop through them every time he uses them.The movie 's use of music is note worthy too , although it contains no score in the usual sense , The opening theme is good , and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson 's apartment , and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric .	1
"You ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason ? Well , out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T - Rex . Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the T - Rex from Jurassic Park , I KNEW I had to rent this just cause I was in the mood for a bad movie.I was not disappointed in the least.Mad scientists , secret formulas , a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives , and of course , a big , poorly animated , sock - puppet T - Rex . Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies ? Not to mention the Rex 's hungry is never satisfied ... ever . How he has hungry is beyond me because he actually does n't have an throat ( Really if you look down his mouth when he roars , it 's solid ... like a toy or something ) . Now , I like watching incredibly bad B - Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is . This one was hilarious . I 'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy , because there are scenes where , make no mistake , you will laugh . < br />Do I blame the movie 's budget ... yes , but the acting did n't help either . OK , Tony Todd was actually pretty good , as for some of the female roles ... when you cry should n't "" tears "" come out ? Meh , I am not going to be angry at this movie , i knew what i was getting into and if you 're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends , here 's what I recommend : Watch this movie , then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back . You will be writing Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the next day ."	0
"Steve Carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 Year Old Virgin , having only had supporting roles in such films as Bewitched , Bruce Almighty , Anchorman , and his work on the Daily Show , we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that Carell truly makes his own . You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his "" comedic air "" but Carell takes it to another level , everything he does is innocent , lovable , and hilarious . I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of non - stop laughs ( or 4 hours if you see it twice like I did ) , a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie . The script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all . The music fit the tone of the movie great , and you can tell the director knew what he was doing.Filled with sex jokes , some nudity , and a lot of language , this movie is n't for everyone but if you liked the Wedding Crashers , Anchorman , or any movie along those lines , you will absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin ."	1
"Supposedly a "" social commentary "" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970 's , "" Nightmare "" is full of bad Southern stereotypes , complete with phoney accents . Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners , this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly - disguised "" babe in prison "" movie -- especially in its uncut original version . Nevertheless , acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors , in particular , does a good job of making viewers hate him -- even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes . There 's also a change - of - pace role for the late Robert Reed , who appears as the lecherous warden , and Tina Louise ( previously Ginger of "" Gilligan 's Island "" ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard . My grade : D. < br /><br / >"	0
The mystery here is why this delightful , small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti . < br />Lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations , itÕs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and , unlike some of itsÕ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre , such as The Taste of Others , it actually entertains .	1
"The main problem I see with this film is its score , which screams with every note , "" This is a cheap - ass movie . "" There 's not much more to say here . The score just plain sucked.The second problem , which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film ( one of the the money shots , if you will ) , is the dialogue between Martha ( Adrienne Barbeau ) and the sunflower man ( Richard Ziman ) , in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment . At all times during this dialogue , the viewer is very much aware that s / he is listening to a movie dialogue . In other words , suspension of disbelief breaks down here . The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy - nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau . While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre , I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch . The main point of her performance that did n't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo - like woman on a mission . This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress , and one can not place too much blame , therefore , upon Barbeau . To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part , however , I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.Finally , the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor , most notably during its horror flashes . I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.So what 's my holistic grading of this piece ? I 'd give it a solid C+ to B- , depending upon how much credit you 're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget . Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems , the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism . I see no problems with plot development or coherence ; the dialogue , with the noted exception above , is downright brilliant in places , especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie ; as mentioned , the creep factor was well crafted , if a bit fizzly in the second half ; and Nicholas Brendan , who also associated produced , delivered a wonderful performance.All in all , this film is definitely worth the view --- see it with a Nazi you love . :)"	1
This film is predictable ; it is more predictable then a Vinnie Testaverdi pass , when he huts the ball for the Jets . One saw the ending coming up halfway through the film . The politics reminds me when I was back east . Many people know when the fix is in . I gave this four because of the acting , but the story is lame .	0
I rented this thinking it might be interesting , and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner . Hard to follow , strange editing , disjointed storyline , the characters mumble , all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time . I just could n't get into it and did n't care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this film . Unless you need a cure for insomnia , I 'd skip it . 3/10 , and that 's being generous .	0
I did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention , what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that I have ever seen was of the Heroism , bravery and the Honor to have served in Her Majestys Service . This film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be , however I ca nt say enough for the courage exhibited by Sgt . Cutter in defense of The Uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group.To be certain Sgt . Cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her Majesty the Queen of England . I think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great . A reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear . I think Grant was excellent in this role , truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore . I never felt Ballantine was a shoe - in , in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture . What do I mean?This picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention . Both Ballantine and MaChesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of Her Majesty . These three seem to bring things off rather well and I believe it is a useful , even enjoyable interlude when Ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene . Is it Believable?I do n't know . I think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in Tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the Regiments Post when Ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service , and getting married and going into the tea business . MaChesney says he could sign up for another 9 years . It will make a man out of him . I like that sentiment.I do n't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests . Where does this end , in fact it may never end . Those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that I enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps I enjoyed the picture when I was ten years old . I had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when I went into history and found the information about Kali . There is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the Goddess of Kali , this motion picture takes on a quality that I refer to as intelligence . This is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted . I think this is an excellent film . George Stevens directed.There is a few items to be aware of I do n't think all the information will jive with history however when the Journalist is addressed as Mr . Kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is Rudyard Kipling?George Stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred . The information is honest , compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love Gunga Din . There is in the distance the Black Watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned . Sgt . Cutter is seriously wounded and Ballantine as well as MaChesney are restrained . Din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the Colonel of impending peril . With a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time Din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple . The sound of Gunga Dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned . A very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified . It is so Dramatic and tense filled position that as Gunga Din lay Dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows , Sgt . Cutter says good work soldier . I do n't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril.The end is far from being anti - climatic , it is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed . Ballantine knows his heart and asks the Colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes MaChesney quite pleased with the Colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time . The Colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense . MaChesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal . This is a very sober point and then he comes to Din . Now here is a man who has no actually status so I am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead . The poem is read as though it was just penned by Kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men . Gunga Din Bravo !	1
"Words can not begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is . I wish it were "" so bad it 's good , "" but it 's not . It 's just dull , lifeless , and boring . It 's so bad I could n't even laugh at it.In response to other posters , Anne - Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie . The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly , who as a true statement on vanity , cast himself as the male lead . They both look like inbreeds , sister and brother.The gal , Sherry Thurig , is a looker . The complete opposite of Anne - Marie - attractive . This girl is tall and willowy , and can act . Although you can tell she 's holding back.All the actors seem to be holding back , especially the supporting male , Mark . I 've seen less wood in a rain forest , but he 's still better than Kelly . Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting ? Is he really that bad a director ? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there is n't one . Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime . I know how he felt stepping in the poo , it 's how I felt after watching his movie.Yes , I tried to get my money back from the rental store . This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director ( and if you search them out , you 'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks ) ."	0
Story of a good - for - nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music .

"Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , George ( Jake Weber ) and son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan 's bustling metropolis . On the way , they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow . A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along . Rather than helping , at least one of the hunters , Otis ( John Speredakos ) , is mad because the accident cracked the buck 's antlers . George , Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis , and even worse , we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they 're staying . Meanwhile , Miles is given a wendigo ( a kind of Indian shape - shifting spirit / monster ) token by an Indian whom only he has seen . Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes ? Are there wendigos in the woods ? < br />I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers . It is a fairly low budget film , with technical limitations frequently showing through . Much of the film , and maybe all of it , is not really about the titular creature . And perhaps the fatal blow for many people , it has a very ambiguous ending , with a number of questions left unanswered . If you are discouraged by such endings , and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant , do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.Personally , I like films like that . I usually prefer some ambiguity . The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick , scary creature flick , where they 'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end , and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2 : The Monster Returns , but that 's not what this film is . Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people . Heck , writer / director Larry Fessenden even has a character , George , reciting Robert Frost . The Frost poem , and George 's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things , is the key to the film.One of the best things about the film is its complexity . In a way , there are four different films occurring at the same time , a thread from each character . In George 's thread , he is n't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world , and he has some parenting problems . For him , the film is a realistic , horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse . In Patricia 's thread , she 's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family . She 's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her , hoping that they 'll go away and get better . In Otis ' thread , he 's even more down on his luck than George , and George 's arrival into his life symbolizes the final "" crack "" in his psychological armor . And in Miles ' thread , which is probably the most important of the film , life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world . But this is a horror story , after all , albeit one with a glimmer of hope , and the events in the film give Miles ' poetic interpretations a dark turn . Still , when everything is said and done , he seems to be the only one retaining his composure , due to the poetic outlook.Even though the film is low budget , there are a lot of well - executed higher budget ambitions . Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations , and created some interesting slide show like montages ( such as the cards , or the Indian wendigo images from the book ) . There are also interesting more traditional montages , such as Miles ' nightmare . Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films.Other technical aspects are good for the budget . The "" Wendigo "" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous . The lighting was usually good -- there were a few times that dark scenes were n't as clear as they could have been , but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock ( it could have been digital instead ) or transfer . I thought the performances were good and far more realistic ( if you value that ) than the majority of films . Although I did n't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment.Overall , Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you do n't mind having to think about the movies you watch ."	1
"Basically , take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie . The story goes like this : a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths . There 's some s * * * going on with ghosts , which if you 've seen any Asian ghost movie , is n't scary by now . This movie was quite upsetting because it 's very clichéd . It 's the same bullcrap , different movie.The acting was pretty good . Unfortunately the actors are put into a very Ring - esquire situation , so it 's nothing we have n't seen in the past . The two lead acts did a solid job though.As far as gore , there 's not much going on . We get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off ( I do n't know how else to explain that ) , but it was cut away so you do n't see anything except the final result . You see some blood at times , including decapitated arms and a zombie ( that looked really cool I might add ) , but this movie is n't too bloody.The scares in the movie are few and spread out , and it 's really not that scary . You 'll get some creepy images at times , but it 's not enough for me to consider scary . It 's nothing different from Ringu , Ju - On , or Dark Water , and none of those scared me either . That 's really the downfall of this ( and most Asian horror movies ) is that if it does n't deliver the scares then it 's just not that good.As far as directing , Takashi Miike still did a pretty good job . He seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies , but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he 's become famous for . A lot of images were a lot like Miike ( including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses ) , and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more Miike then the rest of the movie . Still , the movie is flawed by its unoriginality.I would recommend this only to people who are huge on Asian horror movies ( even if you are , I can recommend much better ) or big Miike fans . Warning to those who want to get into Miike , this is NOT his best work.I'm giving it a 4 because it 's just mediocre . Perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating.Also , I 'd like to b * * * * about Asian horror movies real quick . How come if it 's an Asian horror movie it 's automatically suppose to be good over here ( US ) ? A LOT of these movies are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream , Urban Legends , and I Know What You Did Last Summer were over here in the 90 's . If you 've seen one you 've seen them all . And a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it does n't deliver the scares they set out to do then they 're just not that good , and nothing would change that . More Asian horror films need to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters , two movies that if they do n't frighten or scare you , at least they have great stories , acting , direction , cinematography , and much more to back them up . Two movies that are n't just great horror movies , but great movies in general . More Asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the cliché , "" A ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone / video tape / house / electric appliance / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc .

"Phantasm .... Class . Phantasm II ..... awesome . Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible.Even though i would love to stick up for this film , i quite simply ca n't . The movie seems to have "" sold out "" . First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start ( something the others did not ) . Also too many pointless characters , prime examples the kid ( who is a crack shot , funny initially but soon you want him dead ) , the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls ( erm not gon na work , or rather should n't ) and the blooming zombies ( what the hell are they doing there , there no link to them in the other Phatasms ) . Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.The only good bits are the cracking start and , of course , Reggie B.(Possible SPOILER coming Up)To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.Overall very , VERY disappointing . 3 / 10"	0
I 'm a big fan of B5 , having caught on only at the end of season three . I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated , concluding that it was one of the most well - thought out story arcs to ever hit television . Even the filler episodes were interesting . The movies , also , were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.Which brings us to ' River of Souls ' . Naturally , after seeing everything else , I had high expectations . Martin Sheen appears to be acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious Sci - Fi story . The story itself , might have looked good in outline form , even made it to the story board . However , it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie . There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story . There are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out . Had this made the regular season , it would have rated among the worst of the episodes .	0
""" Kolchak "" was a TV series that really did n't fit into any category . Part horror , part comedy , some social awareness thrown in , and what we have is something that I think people were n't ready for . It 's a shame really , as I 've started to watch these shows on the Chiller network , ( I never saw the originals ) , I realized how different and interesting it really was . < br />Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak a reporter for the International News Service , and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss , Tony Vincenzo , the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter who more often than not , became a part of the story himself , as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night . The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart . A somewhat goofy guy , who always wears the same suit , you can not help but love him . His jokes are great , and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor , Oakland , are downright hilarious . < br />The stories are for the most part pretty good , and the acting is very good . The 70 's were not a * great * period for special effects , and the show suffers for it , but if you suspend disbelief , what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it 's time ."	1
"-A very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . As the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man Jack becomes deadly as he threatens Lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in , or else have her father die . See now that 's what you happens when you fly coach , stuff like that never happens in first class.-Other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight , the other thing that this movie shares with "" Flightplan "" is the sheer unbelievability * if that 's a word * of the story . The point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician 's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan , but wo n't it have being easier for Jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel 's system ? Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers , so I 'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie.-Plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . This is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . But I 'm 100 % sure that I 'm reading way too much into it . The movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of "" 24 "" so one ca n't be perplexed by such complexities . For all my complaints though , this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . It 's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain , but at the same time it does n't require great intelligence to fully enjoy.-I'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really I ca n't . I love Rachel McAdams , I love Cillian Murphy , and I like Brian Cox , but they do n't really stretch their acting muscles here . It 's not really much of a problem since this is n't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting is n't the least bit horrible , just not great . Wes Craven is n't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this , but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . It was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing "" Cursed "" and as much as I liked him doing something different with this movie , I still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it 's release.-One nice thing about the movie which I really appreciated was just how short the movie was . It is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while , but nowadays it 's like every movie that comes out feels too long , where as this movie just felt like the right length . Not too long , and too short . They do n't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this is n't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . Being a huge film music geek , I have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by Marco Beltrami . It 's really nice to see Beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he 's doing now . I really the cool techno / orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . Too bad that I ca n't find the soundtrack anywhere , would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime I wanted instead of having to pop in the DVD when I want to hear it.-Overall It 's nice for what it is and whiles it 's far from great cinema , should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half"	1
"May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren . The visit is awkward because the grandchildren and "" kids "" do n't really seem to know each other as one might expect . The warmth that should be there is missing . After dinner , May 's husband says he does n't feel well , blames it on his daughter 's cooking , and irritably says he wants to go home . He dies that night.May , now a widow , is lost . She clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one , but she had a purpose . She had someone who needed her , and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years , she had something to do with her days.She is depressed and unmotivated . She goes to stay with her daughter , Paula , who shortly after her mother 's arrival , lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all . She lets loose with anger over her mother 's lack of nurturing . May seems disarmed and surprised , yet she also does n't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right . "" I 'm your mother and I love you . "" What does really say ? ( I 've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means . ) Paula is a bit ( well , more than a bit ) neurotic . Both women are needy , though they show it very differently.Paula has been involved with a friend of her son 's , Darren , who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son . While Paula is working during the day , May begins to have conversations and lunches with Darren . Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son , Nicky , but supposedly does n't live in the home with his wife.May becomes attracted to Darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have . Darren becomes attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life . ( He also becomes too interested in money that May says she can give him to "" get away from it all , "" though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey . They end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day , and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years , nor had ever expected to know again . As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave the married Darren , this becomes part of May 's rationalization that what she is doing is okay.At a writing group that Paula leads , May is introduced , rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted . There is one scene where she has sex with the older man , who clearly can barely perform , and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on May 's face as she endures the one - time ghastly liaison.Eventually , Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother , that indeed her mother and Darren have been having sex.This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways . Sympathies will be divided . At one point , during Paula 's writing group , May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day , and would leave for pubs after they were asleep , making sure to get back home before her husband.Clearly , a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub . May , however , also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband did n't like her having any friends , so she did n't have any . She did what he wanted her to do . She was miserable but she put up with it because , as she said , "" it was easier . "" So , while May was not the best mother , for those inclined to have any sympathy for her , one might see May 's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for "" a few minutes "" in her lifetime . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her , to know her as a human being , to have a friend and a lover.Paula , though neurotic and unhappy , perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her . Certainly , it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother.It is a well - done film , with more complexities than I have mentioned , and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many , perhaps conflicting , reactions . It is a film worth discussing and debating , and above all , worth seeing.One thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life . No matter who is deemed "" right "" or who is deemed ' wrong "" by each viewer , that theme of old age and loneliness , evoking a sense of dread in most of us , is inescapable ."	1
This is just as good as the original 101 if not better . Of course , Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits , and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella . We see a lot more of her this time round . I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin , the rather bumbling male lead . To use Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea . The movie is well worth watching whatever your age , provided you like animals .	1
"Life 's going not to badly for Harry Mitchell , he 's an ex - air force major ( plus nifty little pension I imagine ) , who 's raking in the cash for a patent he 's developed ( fusing titanium and steel via explosive process , creating super metal fit for NASA ) , and his wife of twenty - odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick . He 's got a nice little pad in LA . I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream , and you get a good slice here , what with the restored silver Jag ( a series 1 E - type roadster ) for him , and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her ( as well as I 'm sure other trinkets and boys toys ) . There 's always got to be more though has n't there ? So Harry let 's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans ( you 're only as old as the woman you 're feeling ) . As in many films noir , one mistake , in an otherwise blotch - less life , leads to a downwards arc for Harry.Three blackmailers leech onto him . These are where the value are for me , great character actors playing very believable roles . Bobby Shy ( played by Clarence Williams III ) is a black ex - con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double - crossers . He 's reminiscent of Pluto , the vicious black ex - con psychopath from Carl Franklin 's well - regarded neo - noir "" One False Move "" ( 1992 ) . There 's a similar character motivation I believe . Both men have had enough of the man , and well pretty much everyone , in extremis . Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks , a fat lily - livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $ 25 for half an hour , and $ 50 for a whole hour ( did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount ? ) . He 's in over his head , and it 's great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat , believable breakdown . John Glover wins as Alan Raimy , who is the brains of the plot , an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui . He 's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie , including what I believe is a pretty well - implied rape ( pay attention to his RAP sheet readout , it 's easily missed , and read between the lines for the motel scene with "" Slim"").In common with One False Move , though not exclusively , I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence.So far so good but I think there 's a real problem with the film . Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his "" tit in the wringer "" . My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider . Roy Scheider protagonists never lose , they 're self - sure and smooth , but not in an annoying way . I feel I 'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril , the movie relies on this for dramatic tension ; however I did n't believe it . For me it 's like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullock 's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama , or Stephen Seagal 's character is going to get taken down by the baddies ( did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value ) . Roy Scheider does n't convince as an adulterer either , you do n't feel any annoyance with him at all , his character is Teflon - coated.It also felt like a movie that took some cuts . At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped : Harry 's wife , Ann Margaret , is pretty much a cardboard cutout , an extension of Harry , her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention . The effect that the affair has on Harry 's marriage is n't properly communicated . This could be a Frankenheimer problem , he 's not known for character development . I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS . < br />There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film , but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better ( no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider ) . The film felt short , even with the long running time , and I think could have taken some more fleshing out.But you really ca n't forget the sleaze , like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour ."	1
In the ten years since Wildside aired , nothing has really come close to its quality in local production . This includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated Underbelly , which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne . The miniseries Blue Murder ( which also starred Tony Martin , but as someone on the other side of the law ) may be the exception.Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on the ABC . Having not watched the show in quite a while , I 'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters . The cast is excellent : Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son , Rachael Blake ( who later hooked up with Martin in real life ) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism , and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop whose vice is gambling . Equally good support roles are provided by Aaron Pederson , Jessica Napier , Mary Coustas ( yes , Effie herself ) , and a young Abbie Cornish.The ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a couple of years ago . The logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me , but I 'm guessing it may have something to do with licensing disagreements with the original producers.A great series which has aged remarkably well . Here 's hoping the ABC 's DVD department gets its act together.(According to a moderator on an ABC message board , some sort of further DVD release is due in December 2009 )	1
"Bizarre , trippy , forget - about - a - story - and - full - steam - ahead low budget sci - fi about the Williams family , living in the California desert . They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness ; apparently , they 've been caught in a time - space warp , where past , present and future collide.This is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show , dinosaur - like creatures that have at each other , a friendly and tiny little E.T. who enchants the granddaughter , and so on . This picture does show off a little imagination , if nothing else.Very nice music by Richard Band , engaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen , Randall William Cook , and Peter Kuran , and , importantly , a likable family are key assets . It generates a sense of child - like amazement ; it may very well be that it 's more of a romp for kids ( or the kids inside many of us ) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.I found it hard to resist ; it 's a short and sweet ( 80 minutes ) diversion , and a decent credit for director John "" Bud "" Cardos ( of "" Kingdom of the Spiders "" fame ) and executive producer Charles Band.7/10"	1
This movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society . Therefore , can thieves , rapists and murderers ( the Killer of this movie , Carl Panzram ( James Woods ) , is all three and worse ) be held fully accountable for their deeds ? An interesting notion , but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way . And this is where Killer : A Journal of Murder falls very short . Although the film tries to put Panzram 's behaviour into perspective , with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing , the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit . Sure , the system is corrupt , with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of Leavenworth Prison ( where most of the movie takes place ) , most prison guards are sadistic bullies , and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot . But why on earth does new prison guard Henry Lesser ( Robert Sean Leonard ) take such pity on Panzram ? Even after having read his gruesome diaries ? The movie offers some explanation : Lesser witnesses Panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic ( and stereotypical ) guard , and is impressed by Panzram 's intelligence ( though it is n't clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so smart ) . Surely this is n't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram , even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality ? Towards Lesser , Panzram is quite loyal , and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in Panzram 's diaries . Does this man Lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him ? Perhaps it is Lesser who is a product of modern society , judging on appearance rather than substance.I can advise Monster , starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci , as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope.BTW : Killer looks as though shot for TV ( not so good )	0
"The Odd Couple is a comic gem . One the funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove , Spinal Tap and Lebowski ! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends : obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy , irresponsible Oscar . Oscar 's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude . Felix 's wife leaves him at the start of the movie , and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar . That s when the fun begins.The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one - liners . You are probably already familiar with the "" F.U. "" joke but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau 's comic timing.My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element . This one requires repeat viewings !"	1
"I started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable Hammer horror film wannabe ... and I was n't far off . There 's a fair amount of glimpsed gore , and they threw in lots of nudity , but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists . Holy cow , they actually put a little thought into the story , and did n't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset . And dare I say it , some of the "" gratuitous "" nudity was n't so gratuitous after all , because it fit in with the story and setting.Don't get me wrong , it 's still overall a bad movie , but as bad movies go , it 's a shade more intelligent than the REALLY horrible tripe like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster ."	0
Here 's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox . The movie presents the story of star - crossed lovers ( one Israeli , one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv . The film 's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross - ethnic conflict , but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well . For example , there 's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters , openly gay , is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family , and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room . Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems , and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be , while the boyfriend is confused and rejected . A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment . As we know from Yossi & Jagger , Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences . The film is also effective for the even - handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other . If you 're not heartless , you 'll cry through the last third of the movie . Though the plot is melodramatic , it 's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be .	1
If you have n't seen this , you do not know what you are missing . The first time you do , you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard , and having probably wet yourself as well.It is THAT funny . There has n't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close . So many classic one liners , stories , and segways .. The drunken uncle at the BBQ , Gi Joe , Mr T , goony goo goo , ice cream man , you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I 'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter , or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.Pure classic ! ! Shame you ca n't get it on DVD .. Rating 10 + out of 10	1
Another demonstration of Kurosawa 's genius , his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers , essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post - war shanty town . Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back , this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way , mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads , withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol . Mixing kitchen - sink realism with Kabuki - esque theatrics , Kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience , drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness . A wonderful , draining experience .	1
And I gave it a high 7 ..... Why ? Because it bloody well rocked . At the time when there were so many OTHER shows on that were tied to toys / games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories . As others have said here it was ahead of its time . < br />Sadly this is why the show was doomed . They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far . I am hoping that more come out . < br />How does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out .. I do n't know I still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation , and that IMHO is it 's only flaw . The writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition ........ < br />I do hope for more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in proper order ... The DVDs are good but I do n't think the stories are in their proper order , but despite this the show rocked .	1

"Have never understood why the MacDonald - Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly -- not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone . To me , "" I Married an Angel "" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo 's more celebrated outings . The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical , the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ( "" San Francisco , "" "" The Women , "" "" Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , "" etc . ) , the Rodgers and Hart tunes ( albeit altered a bit by MacDonald - Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest ) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart ( Oscar - winner for scoring "" The Wizard of Oz "" ) , and best of all , the "" singing sweethearts "" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings . Try to show "" Rose Marie "" or "" Sweethearts "" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still , but this offbeat , fast - paced fantasy is bound to entertain ."	1
There 's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis . I mean it 's Shakespeare 's Hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written . I 'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have  through Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie , in this case I can not imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips . In a word , this German , made - for - TV version of Hamlet is dreary . 152 minutes ? No way ! It 's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on . I 've said it any number of times , but entertainment is the thing for me . And this wrist - slitter is far from entertaining . I will , however , give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting . A 3/10 sounds about right to me.As much as I enjoy MST3 K , their comments do n't help to make Hamlet any more palatable . There are a few good riffs here and there , but overall , Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow . As much as it pains me , I 've got to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3 K rating scale .	0
""" Twelve monkeys "" 's got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam 's masterpiece . An outstanding screenplay , a sustained rhythm , clever sometimes ironic dialogs . Moreover , he had a good nose about the cast . "" Twelve monkeys "" is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies . Here , a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero ( as it was the case in "" Die hard "" ) . No matter how he tries , he 's a prisoner of the time . The movie contains a very thrilling end too . It 's got a real dramatic power . But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man , the dangers he dreads ( notably , the ones that could cause the end of the world and here , these are virus that can create illnesses ) . No matter how long it will take , "" twelve monkeys "" will be estimated at its true value : one of the masterpieces made in the nineties ."	1
Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original . It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month.I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my local video store . If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it . The suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent.<br / >	1
"i searched video store everywhere to find this movie , being the huge elvis fan that i am , and i found it to be a huge disappointment . kurt russel had most of the "" elvis moves "" down and the voice imitation was great , but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just did nt work for me . the voice did nt always match up with russels mouth , and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable . also , there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film , people who do nt know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts . songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life , the time when he got his first guitar is wrong , i m pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave , not one with a huge headstone reading JESSE GARRON . i know it was just a tv movie , but they skipped over important events , like the come - back - special , and dragged some scenes out for way too long . if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS , or another elvis concert . hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent . ( brilliant statement i know , but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic . )"	0
Eddie Murphy for best supporting actor ? ? ? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou . < br />Jamie Foxx ( who can act ) walks through this film like a zombie . < br />Beyonce ? ? ? That was acting ? ? ? < br />This movie pales in comparison to CHICAGO or just about any other recent musical . < br />If it were not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson I would have given this a ZERO.And no I never saw the stage play so I am not making the typical Broadway vs. Hollywood rap .	0
This movie is probably for you . It had an overall meditative quality from the music , to the beautiful photography , and listening to the often cliché things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots . If you 're familiar with Buddhism- that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film . The impermanence of life , the beauty of nature , the interconnectedness of all things , etc . However , what I did not understand , confused , and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing ( I saw over an hour of it ) was the redundancy of the whole thing . You only find out bits and pieces of why he 's commissioned , and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work . The art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends .	1
This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of ' The Prsoner of Zenda ' . Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage , atmospheric but nothing like the real thing , it is a story of obsession and thwarted love , from the novel by Somerset Maughan.I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones . So I bought it . Well she looked fine but I 'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh . Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors , make no mistake , but here she did make one . It was impossible to take her character seriously . It was n't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke ' Mary Poppins ' cockney accent but close.In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly . He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well . Worth watching despite Ms Davis ' vocal gymnastics .	1
"This remarkable film can be summed up very easily . First of all , while the comparisons to "" Princess Bride "" are inevitable , it 's almost futile to do so . While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop , "" Stardust "" is so much different than any other fantasy / sci - fi film I 've ever seen . It 's such a hybrid of those genres , but its plot and script are so unique that -- along with the performances , special effects , cinematography , and score -- the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen . Secondly , the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along , while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist . Thirdly , I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way . In fact , the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch . Wonderfully casted , and superbly acted across the board . This fantasy adventure ( with sci - fi elements ) was the best one I 've seen since "" Return of the King "" ( not that I am comparing the two at all ) . OK , so its not that easy to sum up , but do n't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film 's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer ( or even possibly in a long time ) !"	1
"Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I 've ever seen , I invariably reply "" Black Noon "" and to this day nobody 's ever heard of it.I watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening . As far as I know its only ever been shown once in the UK and sadly is unavailable on DVD or VHS.If anyone can trace a copy please let me know.If I watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film !"	1
"Me being of Irish origins , loved this movie , Not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest . I loved the girl who he fell in love with too , she was pretty . They were such a cute couple . The ending was so sad . Love this movie ! Although it is a little dirty , it reminds of a British or Irish version of Prime . If you liked this movie you should watch prime . Same story line young guy falls for older women , older women falls for young guy to . A lot of paths cross , in the end , the best decision is made or task is completed . Do n't have anything else to say , without ruining the whole movie , all though I thought the french guy was ugly , less appealing to me . Umm ... if you like Irish movies , I would recommend "" Circle of Friends "" , that movie is so good . Quick quote , you might not get unless you watch it "" well , that s my dinner ruined .

Okay , I 've always been a fan of Batman . I loved the animated series , and even Batman Beyond . I even read a batman comic now and then . So as can be imagined -- I was a little excited when I heard about this series , and then I was SEVERELY disappointed . This series is nothing . It does n't even begin to compare with the original series . It 's like one long TOY commercial . No depth whatsoever . And what the heck was with the Joker ? Who , in my most humble opinion , is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they KILLED him . I wish I could say his design was the worst part . Actually , I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting . In short ( because believe me I could say so much more)do NOT waste your time on this show , or your money .	0
"WARNING ! ! ! TONS OF DEAD GIVEAWAYS ! ! ! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SERIES ! OR YOU CAN , WHATEVER.They're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another ; Liars , Cheats , maybe even some words that ca n't be uttered . But When Elm Street 6 : Freddy 's Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old , and wanted to stop seeing him , or people who wanted their hero ( or Villian ) just stops for his final breath , This film was it.This film starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz , Then you see a kid who is named only as John Doe , Who is the last child in Springwood , Ohio , leaves and gets out of Freddy territory . A woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy , and at the same time , has a dream about a man , a water tower , and a promise of a secret floating in her mind , goes back to Springwood to figure out this frightening vision , and soon finds out that she is Freddy 's child , And we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him . And beyond that , fright ensues . This film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know.This film has tons of humor , and cameo appearences , like Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold , Alice Cooper , Johnny Depp , and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly 's "" In - a - gadda - da - vida "" , then gets stuck in a super Mario parody of sorts . This film will either make you hate this movie , or like Krueger even more . The best of the best ."	1
My comment is limited generally to the first season , 1959 - 60.This superb series was one of the first to be televised in color , and it was highly influential in persuading Americans that they had to buy a color television set , which was about $ 800 in 1959 , the equivalent of more than $ 3,000 today . How many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17-inch screen ? I was eleven when the series began , and I watched it from the beginning.Watching it now , 50 years later , several things come to mind . First , many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining , which dates to 1859 . For 1859 , the weapons and clothes are , for the most part , not authentic . ( The haircuts are left out of the discussion . ) That 's basically a nitpick.And , it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years . Pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem as late as 1847 , and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later.Indians are not played by Native American actors . John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s . The Bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later . That is a major nitpick for me.There are other time - line problems . In Season 1 , Mark Twain appears , and he is depicted as a middle - aged man . Mark Twain was 24 years - old in 1859 . The stories also vacillate between 1859 - 1860 ( pre - Civil War ) and what was more suitable for an 1880 time - frame . There are continuity problems , over and over.It is somewhat off - putting , too , that there is so much killing in the first season . In time , the killing was reduced.Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant , which would be hard to believe , given the time - line , but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the Nation 's attitudes beginning in the 1960s.Having said all that , the acting is good , and I have come to conclude in my latter years that Adam 's character was drawn better than any other 's . I do n't think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved . Also , Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker ( Hoss ) was a good actor.Many of the stories trace real historical events . The guest stars were interesting.This was great family entertainment , and the series stands up very well by any measure .	1
"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg , as an actor , that made me even more anxious to check out this flick . I remember he was interviewed on "" Jay Leno , "" and said that he turned down a role in the big - budget Adam Sandler comedy "" The Longest Yard "" to be in this film . So obviously , Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops . I 'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in "" The Tenants . "" There are certainly better rapper / actors , like Mos Def , who could 've done more with his role . But the point is Snoop did a "" good "" job . He ca n't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections , but that 's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing . The point is I found him convincing in the role , and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott 's character captivating . McDermott , by the way , gives the best performance in the film , though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop 's not - so - subtle acting . Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself , I could n't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating . It did aggravate me how Snoop 's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work , and berate him for criticizing it . But you know what ? I 'm sure a lot of writers are like that . His character was supposed to be flawed , as was McDermott 's , in his own way . My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending . For some reason , it just felt too rushed for me , though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters , rather than plot ."	1
There is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant , Jayne Mansfield , Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer . Those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by Stanley Donen , whose comic touch was so evident in , among others , DAMN YANKEES ! , BEDAZZLED and CHARADE . For the first five minutes , or so , it seems that those expectations might be met and then  . Nothing . What is supposed to be a light comedy , plunges into leaden , heavy handed melodrama , with nary a chuckle to be had.Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance , or lack of one , in this film , but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant frequently appears flat and wooden , attacking Parker seems unfair . Not even as bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering , dreary and wholly pointless script , which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer 's interest and patience down with it.The rest of the cast , especially Ray Walston , keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings , but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation . The desperate , inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film 's final moments only serves to add insult to injury.This film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels .	0
I had a video of the thing . And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep . It 's slow - moving , and the idea of a mid - Atlantic platform , which may have been revolutionary at the time , is now just a great big yawnaroony . Apart from Conrad Veidt , the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable , and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting . When the water started to spill big - time it even , on one occasion , woke me up.But give the man his due . No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt . He does n't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals . He holds it in his fingers , while showing us the old pearly - browns . There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done . But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke .	0
"Why , oh , why wo n't they learn ? When you 've got a nice , juicy exploitation gimmick , use it ! Do n't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful ; you 're only gon na wind up looking foolish.Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling , who saw a little bit too much of Mommy kissing ( Daddy - dressed - as-)Santa Claus back when he was a kid . So , of course , Harry grows up obsessed with Christmas , and finally , when his disillusionment becomes too great , he flips out , dresses as Santa , and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children , and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.Simple enough , and not a bad place to start . ( After all , how many other holiday - themed horror flicks use the same schtick ? ) Unfortunately , this film wants to be more "" Santa , Portrait of a Serial Killer "" than "" Silent Night , Deadly Night "" . Two - thirds of the film are spent documenting Harry 's slow but inevitable breakdown , when I would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling . You know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.Perhaps Harry 's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director , but alas , we 've got some guy named Lewis Jackson . Apparently , this is his only film , and it shows . The action jumps giddily from scene to scene , without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.Even once the film gets rolling , we 're still treated to heaping helpings of Harry 's self - pity , insecurity , and neurotic behavior . More depressing than frightening , Christmas Evil is one to avoid ."	0
This film was so disappointing . From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love ( why is it called this?)I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery . It did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense . In fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time . In the end the effect was listless.I believe the film was meant to be atmospheric , but it just was n't . The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters . You might say it was mysterious , but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere.The main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation . Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child . The film has very little context for the time , place or character . I am not a prude but the sex scenes ( there were several ) seemed pointless and confused me further , I recognised Lulu but I was not sure if it was the same man , different men , a lover , her husband or was she a prostitute . It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover . This film did manage to make what should have been shocking ( dream sequences involving Lulu 's mother ) seem a bit boring.The nail filing actually made more sense , as it did give some indication of Lulu 's emotional state . I will not fault the actors as I do n't they had a lot to work on.I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull.I ca n't be bothered talking about it anymore .	0
The potential movie extravaganza , set during the 19th century , failed to produce . With big - name actors like Maggie Smith , Albert Finney , and many others , there was no reason for the movie to fail . However , the movie lacked an ending , had a sorry excuse for a plot line , and fell to pieces with its continuity . A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy , brought together by love and destroyed by beauty ( or lack thereof ) and disapproval , has a touching side of a mother 's early death and an absentee father . The father , played by Finney , is a disturbed man , tormenting his daughter in life as well as death . He believes his daughter 's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status . The actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline . Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction , wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch . I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 , purely for the actors ' attempts . Save yourself , stay clear of Washington Square .	0
My comments on this movie have been deleted twice , which i find pretty offending , since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people . Please be tolerant of other people 's opinion . Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood , so ill change my comment completely.I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.Subject : one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions . One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker . So making a movie about his life , which obviously includes his ' ideas ' is a thing one should be extremely careful with , or preferably , do n't do at all . Wisdom starts with knowing what you do n't know . One might think this is not a review of the movie itself , but the movie is not about an imaginary character , it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had / has great influence on the world of yesterday , today and tomorrow . If someone tells a story about a tomato , i can express my thoughts about the story itself , but also about the chosen subject , the tomato . There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts . Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.Screenplay : One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents . Why ? It distracts from what it should be about ; Nietzsche and the truths he found . It does n't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time ! Come on , make it proper English or better yet ; German ! Even Mel Gibson got that part right ... letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion.Secondly , it is well over - acted.3d , Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche . Bad casting.4th , facts are way off.And so on . Its a waste of celluloid .	0
"Invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the "" so bad it 's good "" category if the film was n't quite so sexist or racist . That it is such just makes it plain bad.It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space , and the kind of racist stereotypes ( in this instance , Native Americans ) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b - westerns . In terms of being non - funny , the same walking - through - the - cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie . Ray does do one good impression of Jimmy Cagney ( but ca n't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row , nor handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it ) . There really are n't any production values to speak of , as the "" Star Creatures "" make the Ro - Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic.This film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema ... not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all - night drive - in.<br / >"	0
I just have to throw my two cents in . Relax , it 's a comedy . Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted . I ca n't think of many comedies where they are n't . This is n't a new release , it 's out on video and airs on cable almost every week . Would I see it in a theater ? Sure , I did , when it first came out . It 's funny ... that should be enough.Even if I did n't like it at all I 'd still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton . He 's an underrated and under - appreciated actor . I ca n't think of another who is so capable in every genre . Nor can I think of one who 's as successful . A comedic actor who 's also an action star(short lived but still ) , who 's also a romantic lead , who 's also a dramatic actor ; a villain and a hero . I ca n't think of any , at least not in Hollywood . Certainly none who have been successful at all those genres . I mean there 's Tom Cruise but to me he 's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character . However this is n't about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise so I 'll move on.Gung Ho is worth renting , heck it 's worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal - Mart . It 's worth watching on cable(if you have cable or satellite ) . It 's one of those fun to watch movies . You can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away.To ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .	1
"The words "" Swedish "" and "" Action movie "" do not mix . That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre . This is yet another failed attempt.Lasse Brunell ( Shanti Roney ) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems . One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does n't do what they tell him . They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it.This movie has it 's ups and downs . And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "" ups "" , just "" downs "" . So i guess something in this movie showed some quality . To begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made . The footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice . The acting is of very varying quality . Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual ( i wonder how long Swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank ? ) . Stefan Sauk is laughable as the "" cool "" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate.And what about the action scenes ? Well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice . But aside from that there is not much action to talk about . And that is a common problem with Swedish action films . There is just not enough action going on . Maybe it 's a budget problem , maybe it 's film - making culture . I do n't know , but it negatively affects the experience . Because quite frankly , the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that.I rate this 4/10 for effort ."	0
"Ho , ho , homicidal maniac ! This spirited tour - de - force adaptation of a great EC Comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made . Director Robert ( "" Back to the Future "" ) Zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by Fred ( "" Night of the Creeps , "" "" The Monster Squad "" ) Dekker which centers on a ruthless two - timing housewife ( well played by Mary Ellen Trainor , who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode ) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband ( a nice cameo by Marshall Bell ) on Christmas Eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire - poker . Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit . Alan Silvestri 's spooky , stirring score and Dean Cundey 's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun . And Larry Drake ( the sweet gentle giant Benny on "" L.A. Law "" ! ) , with his creepy hiccuping guffaw , a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes , and a leering , truly wicked grin , makes for a sensational sanguinary Saint Nick ."	1
"Well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that I signed up for an IMDb account just to warn people . It is patently AWFUL ! ! NOTHING makes sense in this movie . There is way too many subplots for a start . Josh Hartnett 's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls ( Some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work ) . Add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo . Harrison Ford 's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the Internal Affairs investigator 's ex - wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which Ford 's character calls from time to time . NONSENSE!!I ca n't remember the characters names ( that 's how forgettable this is ) so I 'll refer to them as Ford and Hartnett.Then there 's the dialogue which is brutal . I mean cringe - inducing stuff here . Throw in every cliché in the book ( having a heart - to - heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name ; the duo being investigated by internal affairs ( why ? ? ) ; hartnett confronting his dad 's killer ) and you 've got one hell of a mess.As I mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non - existent : 1 ) When Ford 's car is being repossessed , how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked ? Were they following him ? ? 2 ) When Hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene ( an earring ) is replicated on of the charred bodies there ( that was lucky ! ) 3 ) When the two are arrested and taken in for questioning - Ford keeps answering his phone and Hartnett "" centers himself "" with a yoga pose on the table . Instead of taking the phone from Ford the IA guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before Ford does . Meanwhile the female IA officer in with Hartnett is rubbing herself all over him . Then , inexplicably , the two are released without answering any questions . 4 ) During the car chase Hartnett 's car is crashing and smashing its way around Hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again . Not a scratch ! 5 ) When Ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at ? ? 6 ) When the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett 's car , Ford is trying to close a real estate deal . Come on ! 7 ) The bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever . His motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label ? They might leave his label and it 's a warning to keep his other groups loyal . But hang on , how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan ? ? 8) Why is the IA guy who is investigating Ford arrested in the end ? There is no explication ! ! 9 ) And Hartnett gets to use his "" acting "" to capture the bad guy in the end.I could go on , I really could . Anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that 's all it is . There 's nothing else to it ! It 's not supposed to be satirical or ironic . It 's just crap ."	0
"In São Paulo , the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano , Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class , they go to a party with drugs and booze . On the next day , after their classes , the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl . The girl dies , they panic and decide to get rid off the body , but Cristiano 's mother arrives , startles with Gabriel and rolls the staircase , breaking her neck . The trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill , but along the night other tragedies happen.The polemic and shameful "" Cama de Gato "" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth , and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I have seen along many years . The shallow , tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste . The screenplay is not funny , with stupid lines and dialogs , and boring , manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end . The acting is terrible , apparently with many improvisations , but no talent , and I was disappointed with presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash . The camera , framing , cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality . The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking ( probably it is a plus , since this flick sucks ) . The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex - exploitation . My vote is one ( awful).Title ( Brazil ) : "" Cama de Gato "" ( "" Bed of the Cat "" )"	0
Some of the acting was a bit suspect . I remember that asswipe Alexander Walker ( Evening Standard critic , yeah OK , he 's now dead ) launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying NI Protestants as murderers . Now with respect to all NI protestants , this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers ( who were loyalists)and who roamed Belfast in the 1970 's . Believe me , they were not called butchers for nothing . my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope , it 's all doom & gloom , i mean did the little girl at the end have to die . Maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either .	1
I saw this movie in sixth grade around Christmas Time , and I was really excited about seeing it , and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it , I was really excited , because I really love George C. Scott ! When me and my class were watching this movie , I was really into it , and when it was over , I was really impressed , I thought that it was totally fabulous ! This is the best version of Charles Dickens ' classic novel that I have seen so far ! George C. Scott 's performance as Scrooge is something else , I thought that he was the perfect choice , he was Scrooge , he is the definitive Scrooge ! I 've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol , the other is the one with Patrick Stewart , but this is the better one ! < br />What it really great about this is the acting , I thought that the actors were fabulous , everyone was , the spirits , Tiny Tim , Bob Cratchit , everyone , they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts ! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott ! When I saw him , I thought that he was the absolute best ! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge , I do not think that they could have found someone better ! I do n't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie ! < br />This movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by Charles Dickens , and I really think that you will agree , you will think that this movie is fabulous ! I am probably going to have to buy this movie on DVD , because I thought that it was totally fabulous ! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece ! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol , period . < br />10/10	1

"I work with children from 0  6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops . The Doodlebops are energetic , vibrant and appealing .

The Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun .

In my opinion , this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier . I doubt it would benefit from modern technologies , but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70.The artists and animated did a great job . In my opinion , this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design . Animation are extremely smooth and realistic . For the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see , so everyone did a great job . It can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters , if not the sexiest , that beets typical anime girls with ease.Unfortunately , there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment . First , the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies , and is really old - fashioned by modern standards . Second , due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs . Finally , the setting is not so popular at the moment.Conclusion : a great alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian , but not to a novel .	1
"My wife and I are semi amused by Howie Mandel 's show .. I also like Shatner - even when he 's at his most pathetic .. But this is absolutely the worst show on television.Please cancel this show . It sucks a**.The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or no Deal ... The questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure . And watching Shatner or the contestant say "" Show me the money "" makes me want to vomit .. This one will not last ."	0
Saw this again recently on Comedy Central . I 'd love to see Jean Schertler(Memama ) and Emmy Collins(Hippie in supermarket ) cast as mother and son in a film , it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made ! Hats off to Waters for making a consistently funny film .	1
"I lost my father at a very young age . So young in fact , that I have no recollection of him . Over the years I have learned many things about him . One of those things was that he loved westerns , and watching Bonanza every Sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him . I , myself , remember the tail end of the series ' run , having been 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973.Watching this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my long ago lost father . It has all the right elements to make a show successful;laughter , tears , edge of your seat suspense , and it even angered you at times . My most vivid memory of the show 's original run , came shortly after the death of our beloved "" Hoss "" Cartwright , Dan Blocker . One particular episode , and the end of the closing credits , flashed a picture of Blocker , and faded to black , and I can also recall my oldest sister with a tear in her eye at the sight of this . I can remember this as though it were yesterday . On behalf of my late father , who is not here to say so himself , we love Bonanza . Long live the Cartwrights ."	1

I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this ! I have n't seen such a bad movie for years . Omg this was a really bad movie . Splatter , is not enough to describe the unnecessary ( nearly funny ) blood scenes ) . If you did n't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween ( 2007 ) .. well this is 10 time worse . The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.!I ca n't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible . Cliché all the time . ( why i must write 10lines ? i never understood this.)==Here comes spoilers==The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro . We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice . Actually those people are just missing . And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery ( well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy ) and as usual no one believes him ! what a surprise ! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher !	0
Some films are so bad that they 're good . This is clearly not one of them . Based on a true story , this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio 's chances of becoming a real boy . The acting was terrible , the direction was poor , and it travelled way too fast . It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home.Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress , but then every film she made was pretty low - budget anyway . Like most of her other films , she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much , talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic . She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she 's talking to a camera , when she should be engaging the viewer in her character . It pretty much lets down the whole film , and any leg that it may have had left to stand on , is ruined.Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end . But even that was n't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film.Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast .	0
"Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos . Unfaltering performances , rock - solid writing , and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever.All of the cast are strong , but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch of those Emmy 's . Anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes ; particularly from the first few seasons . James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce , absolutely terrifying , and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him.Many people that I 've spoken to about The Sopranos ( who have n't seen it yet ) will say "" I 'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows "" . Whatever . Run - do n't walk - and get it . Those same people usually love "" E.R. "" , but I bet they do n't much care for hospitals ... It 's not about the context ."	1
Yes , Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.Dresler is good . Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.I watched this for Polly Moran , whom I 've seen elsewhere . Here , Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler 's shrewish friend / foe . Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.The plot is good hearted . Bad guys try to rob the townspeople . Dressler triumphs and all ends well.I do wonder about the central plot mechanism : bonds . This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly . I , however , not of that era , am vaguely familiar with them . They 're like stocks only different , right ? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity .	0
This movie was n't just bad - it was terrible . After I watched it , I actually felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get the filth off of me . There is running ' gag ' with an elderly couple making out , it is not funny , but it is disgusting . The monster make up was cool , but that is all . The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was . The editing is really poor.Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie . Even if your group of friends are into ' bad movies ' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude , I could n't even bring myself to laugh at it . You have been warned .	0
Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth 's directing debut - Haiku Tunnel . So I was looking forward to his brother ( and frequent collaborator ) Jacob 's , The Best Thief in the World . This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower - class area of New York . The movie is not without its poignant moments . But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious : Life can be very difficult for some people . And life is n't fair.More subtle , and more important , is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti - social behavior they may spawn , these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity . We can recoil at their language and their living conditions , but we are can not discount their intent . And in fact , their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate . Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood , and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.Having said all this , The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws ( including the title ) . The characters are n't very believable . The writing is uneven . And the plot - line is barely discernible . And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes . To each his own : But while I do n't question the potential realism of this phenomenon , it pains me to see 5-year - old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line - up of women . It 's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest .	0
"Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me . While the actors did a pretty good job , especially Smith , there just is n't a cure for a poor script once in production . The movie really had a "" sequel "" kind of feel , playing off partial events of the first film . The story was , in a word ... bad , at best . It was n't thought out well , and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times.In the first flick , the MIB Organization had a kind of "" elite "" force feel . You had a few special agents , and it had a "" clandestine "" kind of feel to it . In the sequel , the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe.The movie was n't terrible or anything .. it just lacked the "" coolness "" ( for lack of a better phrase ) of the first movie . A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second , and did n't really add any originality to the MIB Universe.A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 films . Was it decent ? Yeah . Is it worthy of bearing it 's title ? Not really ."	0
"Fabulous , fantastic , probably Disney 's best musical adventure . I have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative , clever and fun . Even despite the silly "" flying bed "" scenes , the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny . Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine ? I can not think of anyone more suited to the role . Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins.David Tomlinson , though he had few quality movie roles , absolutely shines in this adventure . He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays . Blustering , prim and proper Englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does . It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice.The dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just do n't capture . I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine 's house and she must defend it in any way she can.Bobbing along , bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny , sea . Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers . All of them are fantastic and worth remembering , Portobello Road being one of my favorites.A great film that still holds up today ! !"	1
"There is a story ( possibly apocryphal ) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys . Gilliam ( allegedly ) produced a long list ( think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element ) and handed it to Butch Bruce . It was entitled "" Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts "" . It ended with a simple message saying : "" please do n't do any of the above in my movie"".There is a fact about this movie ( definitely true ) . Gilliam did n't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary ( if not commercial ) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually , the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film . It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general ( but magnificent ) strangeness . Gilliam delights in wrong - footing his audience . Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real , Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork , bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate . It is this journey , and the character developments they undergo , which unsettles.I love Gilliam films ( Brazil , in particular ) . But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness . He seems to have so many ideas , and so much enthusiasm , that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess ( Brazil , in particular ) . I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam 's tour de force , but there 's no denying that The Twelve Monkey 's is a breath of fresh air in the tight - plotting department . Style , substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex - Python.Whatever the truth of the rumour above , Gilliam also manages to get a first rate ( and very atypical ) performance out of the bald one . Bruce is excellent in this film , as are all the cast , particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.It 's been over a decade since this film was released . When I watched it again , I realised that it had n't really aged . I had changed , of course . And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes . This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that , partly at least , is about reflections in mirrors , altered perspectives and the absurd one - way journey through time that we all make . A first rate film . 8/10 ."	1
An interesting idea ( four African American women crushed under society 's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks ) is ruined by F. Gary Gray 's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script ( by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier ) full of unintentionally funny moments . Instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them , Gray , Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy . It 's melodrama at its worst . Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carter 's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack , choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers ' bemused faces . And bemused they are : although actors such as Jada Pinkett , Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent ( Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she 's an excellent rapper ) , they need a surer hand than Gray 's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera . Steer clear .	0
"Did n't care for the movie , the book was better . Does anyone know where it was filmed ? * * * this was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question . so now I look like a dummy , but I think I 'll still submit my comments . and yes , British Columbia is lovely * * * Or why they took it from its South Carolina Coastal setting?(this question stands ) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie . Oh , I just read where I need to write at least ten lines . Here 's my other main issue with the film . Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I pictured from the book . I know , the book was the book and the movie ; well not so good . I found the character in the book much more empathetic . Also the book evoked rustic , almost primitive images of the monastery . While the "" castle "" in the film was much more visually impressive , it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters ."	0
As far as horror flicks go , this one is pretty darn good . While it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense , it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you 're into the horror / comedy genre .	1
"This had a great cast with big - name stars like Tyrone Power , Henry Fonda , Randolph Scott , Nancy Kelly , Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser - but - known names with shorter roles . It also had Technicolor , one of the few movies made with it in 1939.Now the bad news ....... regrettably , I ca n't say much positive for the story . It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light .... and Hollywood has done that ever since . Why these criminals are always shown to be the "" good guys "" is beyond me . This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings . The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous . Well , that 's the film world for you : evil is good ; good is bad.Hey Hollywood : here 's a news flash - The James boys were criminals ! Really - look it up !"	0
"I think i watched this movie , but do n't quote me , as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it did n't exactly "" grip my excitement and imagination . "" At least i know i watched enough of it to know i wo n't be watching it again soon . Or ever.Jeez , talk about lame ... Really lame . Totally lame . It would n't even appeal to a six year old .

Ya coulda fooled me - ee - ee ... !Now , if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie "" Critters "" , we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy ... like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they would n't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry.Don't bother watching this . It 's not worth the effort . You can find something more interesting to do . Like watching paint dry . Or falling asleep ."	0
They screwed up this story ! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that ! They added heads getting chopped , wires cutting peoples faces , and the ceiling turning into a giant hand ! What the hell is that about ? ? ? I own and love the original movie , I read the book and I love it ! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost . There is no gore . There is no ceiling hand . It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person . They can not kill us , they can not throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head . No . They can only drive us mad . Taking away all our senses of security . Nell was a selfish woman . She only wanted good things for herself . Yes , she cared a little for the others , but not too much . David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story ! I hate this damn remake !	0
This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff . Well , then let me bash it to . Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays , this film is n't too bad . It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming . She is super hot , but ca n't talk very well . There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped . She shows off her nice body . Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff . 3/10	0
""" GI Samurai "" sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal Japan for no particular reason , and much carnage ensues . It 's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.The plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title ; initial fish - out - the - water antics ( "" what is this flying metal box ? "" etc etc ) , "" are n't we better off here "" discussions and ultimately a huge battle . The latter is proof that the film does n't take itself seriously at all , the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles Chiba 's platoon ; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance . It 's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does n't drag despite its extended length.Chiba gives a gruff performance as Iba , initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him . This is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific CV . By the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers , as they seem to be asking "" were n't we better off back then ? ' . But this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of ( almost ) non stop action ."	1
"This show is so incredibly hilarious that I could n't stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight ( despite the fact that I 've seen all the episodes previously ) . I 've always regarded Silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience . I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I ca n't say that about many TV shows ... can you ? This show is finally something new and interesting and ( most importantly ) funny ! This is a show I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out . You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I predict a long run for this series ... And just to be clear , the people who are offended by this show just do n't get it ... perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it ... they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they do n't understand . Anyone who uses the word "" bigot "" in reference to Silverman , or who claims that she only aims to "" shock "" ... is way off the mark ... She 's exactly the opposite ; just Google her and you 'll quickly see that she 's a huge proponent of civil rights , etc . If you do n't know that she 's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints , you do n't get it . And if you do n't get it , do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity ..."	1
"This was god awful . The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing . I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough . They were extremely superficial people with no dimension . Cheesy , cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere . The stripper chick was just a distraction , even if she was decent looking . I do n't know what this was attempting to be , but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Sundance ? I almost cancelled my subscription . You 'd think a channel like that would show more quality films . There are much , much better gay and lesbian themed films out there . "" The Celluloid Closet "" is an excellent documentary . I thoroughly enjoyed "" Wigstock : The Movie "" . I 'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment , but what I 'm trying to say is that this just was n't worth it . If you catch it on TV , ok , but otherwise do n't bother.There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice ( sad I can count them on one hand ) , otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well . The lighting was way off in a lot of places . I think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it.I ca n't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot ( without the blond hair of course ) . Too bad his acting did nothing for me . Stick with real porn , buddy.3/10 ."	0
"I first rented this film many years ago , and was completely enthralled by it . Just recently , feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way - too - few films that I 've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime , I decided to give "" Erendira "" another look . And I 'm glad I did , as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.The story is about a teenaged girl ( Erendira , played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder ! ) who accidentally burns down her grandmother 's mansion after which the grandmother , played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas , forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages . < br />The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though , inspite of the basic premise , which deals with prostitution , is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content . The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother , and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which , by the way , is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico.The film is very atmospheric , arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality . It sometimes borders on the bizarre , but not to the point of , say , a David Lynch film . It 's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature , read the comments from previous viewers below ... Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion , quiet and melancholy , adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting . The cinematography of the rural places , many of which are in the desert , is quite superb.The film moves at a nice pace , neither too fast nor too slow , and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again , just because it makes you want to do that . For me anyway , it really is that compelling.Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version , with subtitles . I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college , and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue . Por ejemplo : "" El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba . "" ( "" The world 's not as big as I thought "" - i.e. , It 's a small world.)This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine , which , upon drinking , is immensely satisfying , however , you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there are n't more bottles just like this one ."	1
Excellent , pre - code amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired ( by writings of Nietzsche ! ) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself , use men to her advantage . Not really fair on the German philosopher but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power . Stanwyck , even in this young version does n't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here , ever driving herself and the film forward . Not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo . Great fun , if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female . Still , that 's life !	1
"I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne 's "" Waitress "" ( 2007 ) . This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie . Adrienne was a marvelously talented writer - director , an original and unique artist . She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency . Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge . Male lead Reg Rodgers , looking like Judd Nelson , is fine . There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen . The song at the end of the movie "" The Bastard Song "" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy : < br />""It 's a world of suffering,In a sea of pain,No matter how much sun you bring,You're pummeled by the rain ... Don't let the heartless get you down,Don't greet the heartless at your door,Don't live among the heartless """	1
When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV , I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen , this one tops it all off . I had to see this show , and that is what I really did . When I got the first volume of this show , it was the best . I really liked the animation , and all the fight scenes were awesome . I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber , and Archer and of course I also like Illya . And of course , all the episodes on the volumes were interesting , and very cool . Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie(famous for Transformers , and others ) playing the voice of Berserker . He does have a cool character . And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume . So if you to see something good , then see this show , it 's the best .	1
"I am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas . Even Star Wars which is visually brilliant , has one of its central images , a futuristic "" gang that could n't shoot straight . "" Imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons , most of them having an open shot , and they miss.I have read much science fiction , and wish there were more movies for the thinking person . Forbidden Planet , one of the earliest of the genre , is still one of the very best . The story is based on a long extinct civilization , the Krell , who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps . Unfortunately , what they had n't bargained for , is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual . The primitive aspect of the brain , the I d , as Freud called it , is allowed to go unchecked . It is released in sleep , a bad dream come to corporeal existence . Walter Pigeon , Dr. Morbius , is the one who has jacked his brain to this level , and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind . His thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend . The Krell , a much superior species , could not stop it ; it destroyed them . The landing party has never been of great interest to me . The rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable . Ann Francis is beautiful and naive , and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male . Her father 's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties ' astronauts ( for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts ) . They are always trying to figure out "" dames . "" The cook is a great character , with his obsession for hooch . Robbie the Robot has much more personality than most of the crew , and one wonders if Mr. Spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature . The whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star . Morbius ca n't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him . There are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once ; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century ."	1
Where do I start ? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity , in the end I was severally let down . This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene , rather it is a Hollywood ( or pick your film making hub ) story loosely based on some real life characters . I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German ; the blood red text ( title , artists ) should have been the 2nd clue . The story line is contrived ( Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann 's parents , there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt . was there on leave , etc , etc ) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ( SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions , these went away from daily use once the war started , etc ) , the characters are stereo types ( SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power ) . Do n't waste your time .	0
"With a simplistic story and an engaging heroine , this was the horror movie that started it all . John Carpenter brings to life a nail - biting nightmare on Halloween night , when Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut , career defining role ) and her mischievous friends plan a night of sneaky fun- only to cross paths with a relentless psychopath from hell . < br />Michael Myers has escaped from a nearby insane aslyum ... having slaughtered his sister fifteen years earlier , he is now back in Haddonfield , the sleepy Illinois town where his murder took place . Once he sets his eyes on Laurie after she drops off a package to the abandoned house where he lived , he begins to stalk and terrorize her , turning her night of fun into terror as he picks off anyone in his path to get to her.Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody horror flick scary ... with the long gloomy shots it constantly feels as if you 're being stalked by the maniacal serial killer himself . Myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.Although "" Halloween "" is certainly outdated , it is by no means less chilling . The idea alone is goose bump inducing , and this little shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror movies ever made to this day ... it spawned seven sequels and eventually Rob Zombie 's equally scary remake , and it set a new standard for horror that still exists today ."	1
"I 've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time , and while this is n't the worst of the bunch , it 's certainly in the lower half . The script starts off OK . A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern , hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife . Cute huh ? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients . Turns out that there 's a demon on the basement that 's harvesting people 's souls . It 's the job of the 1 doctor , 1 nurse , and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs , do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out , and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects . At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid , I was begging for it to be over . There was still an hour to go . It looked like a half an hour "" Tales From the Crypt "" episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap - fest . From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey ( The Green Mile ) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet , this movie fails in every possible level . I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason . 1 ) His fiancé is pretty hot , she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 ) The movie actually looks OK , a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal - mart quality home cameras.In the end , avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass ( which I do , and I still felt cheated ) . As a bonus drinking game , you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi ( Dr. James Bishop ) shakes his head while talking . You 'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie ."	0
one of the funnest mario 's i 've ever played . the levels are creative , there are fluid controls , and good graphics for its time . there 's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight . Sometimes the levels get frustrating , and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still , need to get more accomplished to fight a boss , it can be annoying . another complaint is the camera angle ; though it works fairly well most of the time , it can be a pain in certain situations . if your a big time mario fan ; this ones for you . even if your not a huge fan of him , i 'd still recommend this one . its a big game , and getting what you need can take a while , but it 's very satisfying . good for playing in short bursts of time . it will almost certainly hold your interest ; it sure does hold mine !	1
Difficult film to comment on , how do you say it 's bad ? Well it is n't , but then it 's equally difficult to say it is good . What it is , is compelling viewing , it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there . It is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life , you know you want to turn away but you have to watch.The Naudet brothers handle the commentary very well , even in the most tragic of circumstances , there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults . The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on.You ca n't change history , and you should not want , this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour .	1
Although i had heard this film was a little dry , I watch whatever Scott Bakula is in . At the start of this film I had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable Scott - gets - girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great . The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever . I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding , right up until when the credits rolled and I realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending . Unfortunately i was left regretting that i 'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott !	0
This is one powerful film . The first time I saw it , the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience . I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD , used the English subtitles when I needed them , and really got into this movie , discovering just how good it is . It is excellent.The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts , with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart , an involving tale of good versus evil . Here , it 's Liam Neeson ( good ) vs. Tim Roth ( evil ) . Both do their jobs well.Few actors come across as despicable as Roth . Man , you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant , irritating puss . ( He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else 's here ) . Neeson is a man 's man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart . Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead . The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved , so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this .	1
""" Emma Woodhouse "" Gwyneth Paltrow ( Shakespeare in Love , Duets ) has nothing to do with herself but painting , going with her friends on her chariot up and down , saying hello to people in town , and trying to match make everybody she knows .

I like Gwyneth , and think that she is a lovely young woman . She is talented , and in "" Emma "" one has the privilege to hear Gwyneth sing .

Episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love , betrayal, ... and a homicidal , escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas.A woman ( Mary Ellen - Trainor)has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance . What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged , Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath ( Larry Drake , perfectly over the top ) threatens her life ... as well as her precious young daughters.This episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program . By the way , this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine .

Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school . So far i think i 've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times . Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to . She 's funny , smart , outgoing , witty , and a lot more . Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina 's aunts . Zelda , the intelligent scientist , and Hilda the crazy , wacky one make a perfect balance in Sabrina 's life . Though i must agree that the college years are n't as good as her high school years , but that does n't mean they were n't still good . I think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped , it made sense and i loved it anyways . :)	1
"This may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever made , but it certainly was far from his best . Obviously , he did this crap for the pay check . Dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man . What he does n't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie , they expect to be entertained , not bored to tears . It 's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman down with him . I do n't understand why talented people ca n't get a grip on the fact that people do n't want to see them in lousy movies . If you 're going to call a movie a comedy , then it should be funny . This was n't . Shame on the US military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum , too .

"A film without conscience . Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money . Then they double cross him . Meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man 's wife , and , without her knowing he 's the killer , moves in with her . Then he "" accidentally "" kills her when she finds out . Then , in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism , he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him . The first problem is that , by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment , the drifter loses all sense of sympathy , worthiness , and heroism . We ca n't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center . We just ca n't care about that kind of guy . And the wife ( nicely played by the fetching Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS ) , a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people , similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter ( despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband ) . And , when she finds out he 's the guy  what does she do ? She locks him inside her house ( as if ALL houses had locks you ca n't open from INSIDE ) with her and proceeds to berate him .

Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch . However the movie greatly exceeded my very low expectations.It is so much more than just a representation of a century . It has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job . The different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch . While watching it I really felt that I CARED about what happened to the characters.I would also like to give endless amounts of praise to Julia Stiles in her portrayal of Katie , she was great in a way that stood out!I would recommend this movie to anyone ..	1
You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget , but the movie is still sub - par . Do nt get me wrong , B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever , but if i was an exec seeing this movie , i would nt have ordered the series . I do nt like O'Hare as an actor , the costumes are silly , and there are tons of cliches . The same can be said for most of the first season ( with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors ) ; Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . If you are a B5 fan and have nt seen this movie , see it . If you are nt a B5 fan , dont ... you wo nt want to watch the series .	0
This film was just absolutly brilliant . It actually made me think . During the whole movie I was confused as hell . I loved everything about it ... it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird , it was hard not to love it . All of the actors were phenominal , and no one could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... it deserves an ocar .	1
When I first got my N64 when I was five or six , I fell in love with it , and my first game was Super Mario 64.And I LOVED IT!The graphics were great for it 's time , a good plot , great courses and above all , the best music I heard in a Nintendo game.I do n't remember the plot completely , but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser , and Mario has to rescue her . The object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle . Each had about five or six challnges to get the stars . There are secert parts of the castle , where you can get more stars . But of course , you have beat Bowser.*I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Lets start with the characters . Mario is the main character , and gets helpful advice from Toad , so he is basically one of your only alliances . I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end . The main villain is Bowser , and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba . The characters are really great.Next , how about the graphics?People say Gameplay is more important then the graphics , and I agree completely . But with he great plot , there are great graphics . Especially for it 's time . I have a whole bunch of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do n't compare to Super Mario . Bright colors , great effects and awesome sound effects . I found the graphics in the water courses very very good . Next to the Bowser world ones , it has the best graphics in the game.Now , the music . This is my favorite part of the game . Growing up , when I played this at a young age , I'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep . Especially the music from Jolly Roger Bay , which was peaceful and wonderful . There are others that are great too , especially in , once again , the worlds with Bowser , are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites.This game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer , and I love it . This game gets 10/10 or * * * * * ( 5)/*****(5 ) GO PLAY THE GAME !	1
Cinematography -- Compared to ' The Wrestler , ' a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer , and then hypnotizes as well.Acting -- The dialogue is minimal , but the pauses and silence poignant.Story -- The conflict in a ' balkanized ' Denmark is volatile , as we saw recently jihad murders in the Netherlands and riots in France . While I harbor no love for Islam , the departure from the West from Christian values holds no cause for celebration.The director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither , emphasizing the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion , not so much in the ring , but to all those around her . Even her worst . . . I will stop here to avoid the spoiler .	1
"Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone , "" Scarface "" is a movie that will not be forgotten . A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana ( Pacino ) comes to America for the American Dream . Montana then becomes the "" king "" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami , Florida . This gangster movie is very violent , and some scenes are unpleasant to watch . This movie has around 180 + F - words and is almost three hours long . This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored . You cheer for the Drug - lord , and in some scenes you find out that Montana is n't as evil as some other Crime Lords . This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this . You will not be disappointed . 9/10"	1
The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell is really good film . It has good acting by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong . The music is spooky and gives that devilish chill!I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns , frill like part on his neck , and acted really viscous!If you like horror films and have n't seen The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and I do n't think you 'll be disappointed !	1
"I have heard a lot about this film , with people writing me telling me I should see it , as I am a fan of extremely bloody , gory movies . I got my hands on it almost right away , but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now . I would have been better off not remembering I even had it.This movie was atrocious . The worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was . I know it was a story by Clive Barker and all , and no I have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you have n't then you will be , as I was , completely clueless and utterly disappointed.The film begins good enough- the actors are convincing , the story interesting . The first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention . I thought the blood looked a bit bad , but seeing as it was the very first scene I did hope for improvement later on . I was wrong . < br />The blood and effects are so horrible , it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that , for instance , someone could knock a person 's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer . WTF ? CGI blood ( did they even use ANY "" real "" blood at all ? My home made stuff looks better than any used in this film ! ) , unbelievable acts of dismemberment ( eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head ; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are BONES all throughout our bodies ? ! ) , too - dark scenes ( every scene is either an odd yellow color , or in hidden in shadows) ... it just gets worse and worse . I found myself pointing out mistake after mistake . There 's just too much . Add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial - killer movie turns into some demonic / supernatural / monster movie at the end ... no thank you ! It should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- OK , with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer . Maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant ? Plausible , doable ... and a lot better I think than the "" real "" story . That could have and should have worked . Instead it became a "" creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you , and unless you read the book , well ... you just wo n't ever understand it "" fiasco . Tragic , what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential . If you like mindless fake blood and gore , you 'll love this . But if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it . Stay away- far , far away ."	0
Even if one did n't realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film 's release , THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR . FU MANCHU would be painful viewing . It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer 's famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus . The potential for satirical commentary on the anti - Oriental overtones of Rohmer 's concept are ignored . Indeed , the movie employs racist insults . There are hardly any actual jokes or gags , just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines . It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs . Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.And then there 's Peter Sellers . He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu , who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith . Sellers is n't one hundred per cent bad ; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he 's oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment . But most of the time , he plays both roles with a weary grimness , thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities . Sellers ' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating ; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny . < br />A few genuinely witty lines , an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk ( Cato in the PINK PANTHER films ) as one of Manchu 's minions , and Helen Mirren 's amusing musical numbers can not salvage this mess . If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedic genius , they wo n't learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR . FU MANCHU .	0
"John Holmes is so famous , he 's infamous ( as the Three Amigos would say ) . This is a Rashomon - like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980 's , in Los Angeles . The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants . There is story from the friend 's perspective , namely David Lind ( played by Dylan McDermott ) . He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash 's place ( Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights ) and is heavily into the drug scene . There is John Holmes ' perspective ( played by Val Kilmer ) , which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings ( with a severe case of cocaine cravings ) . There is also the patchwork recollections of John 's wife ( Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow ) and his girlfriend ( Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth ) that fill in the spaces between the two stories . It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at , just each character 's version . The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people . < br />Paul Thomas Anderson 's Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character , with a tragic yet comedic karma . He is a caricature of a real person . He was more of less , a mixed up kid that got what he got through his "" large "" endowment . Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John 's life into a nightmare for all of us watching . The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie.Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison , from the Doors , enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea , and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine . All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal 's of cocaine junkies . Josh Lucas ' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie . He plays Ron Launius ( I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights ) . Ron was the leader of the gang , loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood . The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think . Did they really use Splenda ? ? < br />Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it ( lots of color and 70 's nostalgia ) , Wonderland is dark . The action is fast and furious , with a lot of jumps . It is twitchy and grainy . There is no comedy , just a never ending pace , as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous , fast paced , edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling . This is a graphic movie . It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie . It actually shows the murders themselves ( through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective ) . It is so graphic , it looks like police evidence of a crime . I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie . This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone . I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights , for those interested in the other sides of John Holmes.-Celluloid Rehab"	1
"This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies . She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film . ( I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career on Davies ' style , that could be termed "" zany beauty "" . ) Vidor 's direction is light but sure - handed , the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary , and the star - watching element for fans of the silent era , with many cameos , adds to the overall fun . It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well . For all movie fans who have a knee - jerk reaction to watching silent films , sit through this one and it may change your attitude . < br /><br / >"	1
In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly , Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical . I sure ca n't do better than that . It 's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra . Kathryn Grayson did n't do too badly with this either.Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it , Cover Girl became a classic . So if Mayer did n't learn a lesson , producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control . When Anchors Aweigh was finished , Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance.The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse . Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney 's Mickey Mouse , but Disney was n't lending Mickey out to nobody . Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film . Not to worry because MGM had it 's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry.Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire . For the next dozen years , these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves were n't up to snuff . It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity , Kelly for MGM , Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios . In Anchors Aweigh , Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit . In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity.When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own . He 'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn . In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film . Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing . One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh , I Fall in Love Too Easily . Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl . It 's Sinatra at his best . < br />With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen , Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra 's mouth than any other person . They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career.On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale . They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings . She also did some classical numbers.Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot . Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell . Trying to fix her up with Sinatra , Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi . They spend the film trying to accomplish just that . < br />My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton , who plays the waitress ' Brooklyn ' never got a number herself . She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that 's what brought her to Hollywood . I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM 's vaults it might still be.Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just are n't made any more . All that creative talent was under contract to Metro - Goldwyn- Mayer . If you had to pay market value for it , the cost might retire some third world country 's debt.But the film results would be extraordinary .	1
When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween , I was very excited . When I found out that it was a book , written in 1978 , I had to read it before seeing the movie . I 'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if I had not read the book . The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book , with minor differences , naturally . I think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col . I 'm not a big fan of Boyle , and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie , she 's always trying to use her over - plumped lips , and darkly makeup - ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy . Indeed , I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house . My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family ( which is so weird b / c the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti - Iraq tirade ) . In the book , obviously the war was not Iraq , but rather , Vietnam , and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter , I was truly creeped out . Overall , I was impressed with the movie , in that it followed the book very well .	1
"Before watching this film , I could already tell it was a complete copy of Saw ( complete with the shack - like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs ) . MJH 's name on a movie would typically turn me away ( ugh , can we say GROSS ? ! ) , but I still wanted to give it a try.Starting out , I was a bit interested . The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters ( especially the man that played "" Sulley "" ) . MJH was even worst , but I continued to watch.However , the ending was the biggest joke of them all ! I seriously sat in shock thinking "" THAT was the ending ? ! Is this a comedy?!"".I thought this pile of crap was funnier than the "" Scary Movie "" spoofs and that is REALLY saying something !"	0
"The first Cube movie was an art movie . It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented , and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could n't understand . It was , on the non - literal level , a "" man vs. cruel nature "" plot , where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end , triumphing to face a new , indefinable world beyond man 's petty squabbles ; a world where there were no more struggle , but peace . I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 , and it 's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.The second movie , Hypercube was a massive disappointment . Some of the ideas were kind of cool , but in the context of the original movie , both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning . Still , for being fairly entertaining , I rated it a 5 out of 10.The third movie , Cube Zero , while ignoring the second , plays like a vastly inferior commercial B - movie rehash of the first , sans the symbolism . There is no "" homage "" or "" tribute "" here ; there is only ripping off . The same kind of plot , with some elements idiotically altered ( like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip - off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).That we see something from "" behind the scenes "" means nothing , because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment , the architects of which we hear nothing of . And , in this movie , those who get through to the exit ( like Kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that ? ! That 's just flippin ' stupid . I 'm glad I did n't pay to see this.The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad , but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10 ."	0
"The third installment of the "" Carnosaur "" trilogy features a bunch of Keystone Kops - quality military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptors and a T - Rex . I give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs . The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy , it really ca n't be taken seriously . More significantly , however , watching this movie I ca n't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "" Carnosaur "" and "" Xtro "" trilogies . The first installment in both franchises is a dark , disturbing film that has become a cult classic , the second is an "" Alien "" ripoff , and the third is a tongue - in - cheek , almost slapstick ( whether intentional or not ) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing . Also , like the "" Xtro "" franchise , all the "" Carnosaur "" movies are completely unrelated to one another . They they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the "" sequels , "" I guess . Obviously "" Carnosaur "" and "" Xtro "" have two different production groups at work here , but if you 've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two ."	0
A wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine Al Schmid . Although it is tough and unpleasant it IS in the end heroic - Schmid 's triumph over disability and depression . The battle scene was superb . But one bone to pick . No matter how many .50 bullets they fired I never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts ! It hurt the realism , but I can live with it . Fine performance by Eleanor Parker , again , as his girl friend .	1
seriously i loved this film .. i had started to read the book and i loved it ... the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose ... i think this film did so well was because Louis Sachar wrote the screenplay .. and of course Andrew Davis directed it ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film ... the storyline is very cool and interesting ... there 's humor , heart and intensity ... it is very similar to the book .. i find this film to be not the least bit boring ... i absolutely loved it ... and i encourage anyone to read the book .. all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted ... two thumbs up for me in every single way	1
"Enjoyed the movie very much . Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more , and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization , particularly of the shooting event ? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at ? Prince Albert 's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it 's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production ( which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one ) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York ? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle / rissole ( ? ) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full ? < br />'Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie , or indeed in her shoes at all . Yet loved the casting of the principals , whose acting was convincing , so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well ? I always felt like a totally detached , uninformed outside observer , much more so than with "" Mrs. Brown "" or even "" The Queen "" . Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen , except that is for some of the more avant - garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time ."	1
With all of the films of recent , dealing with the British Monarchy , is it really time for another ? Answer : YOU BET ! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from Britain dealing with the Royal family . In this case , it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria , and events leading up to the Coronation of her becoming Queen of all England , as well as her romance & eventual wedding to Prince Albert . The film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both England 's Queen & Prince , as well as several other events that transpire ( political turmoil , etc . ) . Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth , while Rupert Friend is her beloved & best friend , Prince Albert . The rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of Miranda Richardson , as the Dutchess of Kent , and the always welcome on screen , Jim Broadbent as King William , as well as a cast of others that shine on screen . Jean Marc Vallee ( C.R.A.Z.Y.,Loser Love),directs from a winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes ( Vanity Fair , Gosford Park , Separate Lies ) . I absolutely went out of my head over the film 's visual look ( by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look ( with the help of production designer , Patrice Vermette),as well as some tight editing ( by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner ) . What I also appreciated in Fellowes ' script is the use of a game of Chess , as a metaphor for some of the film 's political motivation ( the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a Chess board ) . This is smart , well written , directed , filmed , edited & acted entertainment ( and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema . Rated PG by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality , some brief violence ( a little bloody , although nothing too gory),a rude outburst of language , and some on screen smoking	1
"Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie . This is a fine movie that tells about Tetsuro 's quest to avenge his mother 's death , but also grows up in the process . The journey on the train sort of represents Tetsuro 's journey from boyhood to manhood . The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated ( you can tell it 's a 70 's movie ) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "" Star Blazers "" episode . But the story and the characters are so strong , it really does n't matter . A must - see for any animation fan !"	1
as an inspiring director myself , this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind . Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35 mm adapter for DOF . The editing is good acting decent , sound effects are n't too over the top . I would have give it a 7 for an indie film , but the story are n't that interesting . It 's more on the drama side , character developments than a horror flick.It 's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out , or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's < br />This movie is about a family who has a dry field , and that is just that .	0
It is a superb Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I 've seen .. it is simple & deep .. what a great combination!.Michael Nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown.Frida Hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on & never give up.The fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him And defends Michael 's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music.The only thing that I did n't like was the ending .. it was n't that good but it has some deep meaning .	1
"* Warning - no plot spoilers ahead , but movie spoilers nonetheless ... * My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all - star cast . Wow - very , very wrong . This movie is an overdone , overwrought , and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot ! The copyright date on the box said 2005 , yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s , and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s / early 90s dresses and hairdos . It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film ! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback , and therefore supposed to look old , but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s ... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up , and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences ( yet it 's a different , much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks ) . I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences , shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie ! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up ( and indeed acting the co - worker in the 2005 scenes ) . Thus , this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old , re - cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time . The shell story , shot in 2005 , is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60 's to his girl that they would meet on the "" fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ? ) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful , overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie . Do n't bother . There 's a reason why you 've never heard of this movie even though it has a well - known cast - it 's terrible ."	0
Though I 'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films , when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans . Ching Siu Tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty . The great , tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist . Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk , who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number . Perhaps best off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit , truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive . The film takes in elements of fantasy , horror , comedy and romance , all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package . Ching Siu Tung , directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills , and fills the film with mists , shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours , giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere . Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters , with , if I 'm not mistaken , Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times , a marvellous touch . Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times , this is a beautiful piece of entertainment , with swell characters and plotting , even the odd neat character arc , a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere . An ethereal treasure , highly recommended .	1

"I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good - looking horror movie to watch over the New Year 's weekend . As I was looking through the shelves , "" Severed "" spotted my eye , and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent B - grade horror movie . The cover looked fairly good . The plot sounded semi - interesting . So I rented it . What a mistake . Do n't be fooled by the cover , which actually looks decent . I 'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself . The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo - inspired , ritualistic serial killer called "" The Head Hunter "" , who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city ( probably Los Angeles ) , and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder.Story sound somewhat good ? Well , it is , and this movie could 've been halfway decent . But good God , it was bad ! Almost everything about it was laughable . The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge , outdated cell phone , and for whatever reason , she goes outside and talks to some guy . Then , a shadow comes up behind them , hacks off his head , and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling ( for absolutely no reason ) while trying to dial 911 . Sound ridiculous ? Yep , you bet it is . The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHS - quality camera , and I 'm assuming it was . The acting was mostly awful , and the special effects were far from believable . And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful - the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone 's bathroom . Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious , and it did n't hold my interest for very long , and I often found myself bored and tired , mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography . The pacing was bad . Everything was just bad.Overall , "" Severed "" is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent B - movie . The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget , it could 've been alright . But this movie fell flat on it 's face . If you 're expecting something semi - decent , you 'll be sorely disappointed . Only recommended if you can tolerate D - grade horror flicks . Otherwise , you 'll probably want to stay away from this straight - to - video garbage . It had a little potential , but it was beyond a mess . 1/10 ."	0
Holy cow , what a piece of sh*t this movie is . I did n't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie . I guess they did n't know either ! I do n't remember any farting or belching in the book , do you?They took this all times childrens classic , added some farting , belching and sexual inuindo , and prostituted it into a KAKA joke . This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like . I have to say , visually it was interesting , but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor ( if you even think that kind of thing is funny ) I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is.Don't take your kids to see , do n't rent the DVD . I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie .	0
"Leonard Maltin must 've been watching some other movie . ( Though I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource , please disregard his comments on this one . ) He states "" starts off well then fizzles "" when it 's really the reverse - "" starts off tepid then catches fire "" . The plot is about as simple as it gets . Happy Mom , Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation at an isolated beach , Dad incapacitated in accident , Mom runs off to get help , meets up with dangerous escaped convict . Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life.Good white - knuckler given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker , appearing suddenly ( the director , John Sturges , films it in a clever way that will make you gasp ) around halfway through as the cunning , desperate criminal . Meeker is an unusually flippant , reckless actor ( at least here and in the classic "" Kiss Me Deadly "" ) and he happily snatches the keys to the film 's narrative and speeds off with the top down . His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying "" Pretty neat , huh ? "" when he 's especially pleased with his misdeeds . There is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage , Barbara Stanwyck , "" Do n't go away "" . She fires back "" Where would I go ? "" ( they 're in the middle of nowhere ) and he realizes sitcom - ishly "" Yeah , that 's right "" . The friction between them is a hoot.There are flaws , somewhat ridiculous ones . There 's one scene where the police , who have been chasing after Meeker for some time , stop Stanwyck 's car and to evade detection Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would , and pretends to be asleep as she 's being questioned . A. He looks conspicuously un - masculine in this pose and B. I think it 's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion.Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion.<br / >"	1
"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands , having married Shemp 's demanding sisters . At his music studio , Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself ! < br />""Husbands Beware "" is a remake of 1947 's "" Brideless Groom , "" widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp . The remake contains most of the footage from that film . The new scenes , shot May 17 , 1955 , include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp 's sisters , along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine ! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used ; if you blink , you will miss the double 's appearance . ) < br />""Husbands Beware "" would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters . Budget considerations , coupled with fewer bookings for two - reel comedies , influenced the decision to use older footage.Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges , most of their releases by 1955 - 56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in . "" Husbands Beware , "" while one of these hybrids , is watchable and entertaining ; we get to see most of "" Brideless Groom "" again , and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film . This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp , and it was released six weeks after his death.7 out of 10 ."	1
"I just watched it . A couple of laughs , but nothing to write home about . Jason Lee looked like he was having fun . The ( long ) DVD gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter . Selma Blair seemed to be punching a time clock , but then again , her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud , so "" well done "" I guess ? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny . ( Being married to Babs ca n't be a picnic . ) The soundtrack was hip , and eclectic . Larry Miller , who played Julia Stiles father ( hilariously ) , in 10 Things I Hate About You is funny here as well . He 's great , but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles . I could spend two hours watching her fold laundry , and I feel like I just did ."	0
I 'm not a writer or an critic ... I'M just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago .... AND I want to thank people that worked on creating this movie!It is not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why???i would like to understand it myself ... it is easy and accessible .. it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it!It is about love and caring , about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff ....... Look at all the time that we have but we miss it .... why a fu*k do we do that???We need to live like were dying ... care about every second and remember : if we do good things - good things come back to us!HAppiness is real ... and it has a special taste in New York ... i love this town and the world the we live in!!!!thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(English is my second language ) ...	1
"This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I 've seen in a long time . Sadly I was duped into sticking with it , since Donald Sutherland 's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility . [ That 's the last time that 'll happen.]Lesley Ann Warren 's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come . There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film . That s just one of many things in this movie that made me ask , "" Where is the justice?""Why is late - night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem ? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women , and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered . This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process . All it ends up doing is turning the viewer 's stomach with its sickness , and insulting the viewer 's intelligence.The cast is misleadingly good . My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first , and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.I'm kicking myself for wasting time , giving this piece of garbage a chance ."	0
"Although this is "" better "" than the first Mulva ( which does n't say much anyways , I would rather watch paint dry ) it still sucks . Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these Low Budget Pictures guys . I was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did I regret it . Some have n't even been officially "" released "" yet ( not bootlegs - bought from the filmmakers themselves ) and I ca n't even list how bad they all are . Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with . If you are friends of these guys , chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them . But for those that had to watch them ? No way . Bad video , bad audio , bad acting , bad plot ... etc etc . These are n't even funny . I gave this one a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and that is about it . Maybe it does n't even deserve the 2 . About a 1 1/16th star to show it was slightly better than the first ( which I wish I could have rated in the negatives ) . If you want a decent no budget film , go pick up something from LBP 's "" friends "" over at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes . Those are actually decent ."	0
"This movie deserves more than a 1 . But I 'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that 'll take it into the top 100 list . Seriously it 's not that great its not that bad . Its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it 's ridiculous . These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say "" I 'm rick james b!tch "" No matter how old or annoying it gets . I dread having to hear "" I 'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane "" months from now from idiots trying to be funny . Its crappy plot crap acting etc .

"I happened on "" Shower "" in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy . I then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck . "" Shower "" is the story of three(3 ) men , a father and two(2 ) adult sons , each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern China . As with many "" foreign "" films , the Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie.Beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local , Chinese color giving the setting to this story , is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story , all set against the backdrop of a village bathhouse.The family 's story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad I came to know these people . Added to the main story are the numerous small characters , bathhouse customers , and their individual conflicts and friendships . "" Shower "" is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity ."	1
Shown in Australia as ' Hydrosphere ' , this incredibly bad movie is SO bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end , just to see if it could get any worse ... and it does ! The storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class , the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures , and the acting is wooden.The infant ' muppet ' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of ' Total Recall ' . There did n't seem to be a single , original idea in the whole movie.I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way through.Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame . He obviously needed the money !	0
* Sigh * Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea , blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool .

I have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it , which was sometime last year . Anyway i got to see today , and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so . I thought that the movie was pretty good . but the thing i did n't like was how the killer was created , i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like Urban legends : final cut , i almost died it . mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved . CUT is 100 times better than UL : final cut . The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes . The killer kicks MO F***ING ASS.i give cut a 8 out of 10	1
"I loved this series when it was on Kids WB , I did n't believe that there was a Batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 . First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on his own . It was an interesting perspective to their relationship . I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series , and once again like it 's predecessor this show had great story lines , great animation ( better then the original ) , fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing . The only thing that I did n't like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline . I just wish some of the episodes could be longer . My favorite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series , and it 's called "" Over the Edge "" , in my opinion as good if not better then "" Heart of Ice "" and "" Robin 's reckoning . "" Overall a nice follow up , along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy ."	1
"Also known in a different form as "" House of Exorcism , "" this messy < br />little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value < br />whatsoever.The spare plot involves European tourist Elke Sommer who has a < br />chance run in with Telly Savalas , who looks just like the devil she < br />saw on a fresco in the square . Sommer is given a ride to a < br />mysterious house in the country , where Savalas happens to be < br />butler . There , she is mistaken for a long dead woman , and the real < br />soap opera theatrics begin . The house 's blind matriarch's < br />husband had an affair with the dead woman , who was the < br />matriarch 's son 's fiancee . The couple who gave Sommer the ride?Well , the woman is giving the chauffeur , uh , "" back seat driving < br />lessons , "" and the husband knows and does not care . Eventually,most of the cast is killed , Sommer is drugged and raped,escapes , and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty < br />airplane ... which must have resembled the empty theaters this < br />thing played in.The alternate version of this , "" House of Exorcism , "" has scenes < br />added involving a priest.The VHS copy of this , from Elite Entertainment , is crystal clear and < br />letterboxed . There are "" extras "" after the end credits ; deleted sex < br />and gore scenes.Mario Bava 's direction is fast and furious , but his screenplay is < br />awful . There are half baked ideas , abandoned plotlines , and < br />stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing < br />in some sort of forward direction . You have life like dummies for < br />practice funerals , the blind matriarch does not act all that blind,and Savalas is given the same lollipops he had in "" Kojak , "" ( who < br />haunts ya , baby?).The project seems like they had two name stars , then wrote the < br />script quickly , something that happens in Hollywood on a daily < br />occurrence now . Savalas looks completely lost , delivering his < br />lines haltingly , and wishing his character had not died in "" The Dirty < br />Dozen . "" Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot , but < br />her character is a blank , I use the term "" character "" loosely . The < br />only thing we know about her is her name.This is a real weird film , and your reaction to it might depend on < br />how heavily you are into Eurohorror , and Kojak . I for one cannot < br />recomment "" Lisa and the Devil . ""This is unrated , and including all the extras at the end of the VHS < br />copy , contains strong physical violence , sexual violence , strong < br />gore , strong female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , and adult < br />situations"	0
Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor , but it 's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead . The fact that he dances so well , croons so effectively , and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy . In his more cutesy moments ( with the girl in the train station , in the final number with Rosie ) , I could n't take my eyes off him he was so repellent . You keep expecting him to drop the nice - guy act and start snarling . Vanessa Williams was the real star , the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie . By the way , if you see a production of the stage musical , the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie , you 'll see three versions that have more revisions ( different songs , same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations ) than any other musical I 've ever seen .	0
"If you want Scream or anything like the big - studio horror product that we get forced on us these days do n't bother . This well - written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say . Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense , how children interpret the world ( and the violence in it ) , our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends .. all here , but not flatly on the surface . You could technically call it a "" monster movie "" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end , and then it 's even up to you and your beliefs as to what 's happening with the legendary spirit / beast . Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores , though in fact the less you see of the creature , the better . Fessenden successfully continues George Romero 's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out ."	1
"I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago , and blasted it . I believe I called it "" wretched "" and a "" turkey . "" Okay , well , by most standards , it 's still a turkey . It 's got almost no production values , what little plot there is makes almost no sense , and the acting is on the level of a third - grade play . That said , this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic . In fact , all of director Todd Sheets ' films have had this effect . They 're almost like Ed Wood in that regard : Watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines , continuity errors ( same zombie , two different locations ! ) , and other flaws.I'll say this : Sheets is a very nice guy , and while this , one of his first productions , is n't that great , he has gotten better . And I must add that the only really decent actor / actress in the film is Kasey Rousch , though I may be biased , as I attended school with her ."	1
"Well ... the movie was a fun watch . The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by . Like vampires that walk in the sunlight . Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies . A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "" Ow this hurts ... It 's really stuck . "" Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while . And there are random dream sequenes ' that really do n't help with the plot . Come to think of it , nothing really made sense , but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect . Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful , and the zombies were just fun to watch . Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more . But you know , all in all you ca n't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch ."	0
"For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem . Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny ! Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer . The Moroni character is an absolute scream . Watch for Alan "" The Skipper "" Hale jr . as a police Sgt ."	1
I think this film has much to recommend it , particularly an especially sinister performance by David Morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching Mr. Foxx . Although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very , very hard to follow in some cases , all in all , it makes for a nice time in front of the tube .	1
"Hollywood , the home of hype , glamor and the search for profits , is scarcely ruled by spiritual values , and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly ( better to go farther afield -- to the films of Bresson , Dreyer , Rossellini and Bergman , for probing depictions of the spirituality ) . "" Strange Cargo "" is no exception . This odd hybrid of adventure film , love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate . That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne ( Clark Gable at his most cockily mannered and self - regarding ) and Julie ( Joan Crawford , snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Tough Dames ) seems ludicrous at best . Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work , matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the M - G - M lot ? BUT . . .there are good supporting performances here , and visually arresting moments : the shadowy prison barracks ; the escaping boat by moonlight , or against a painterly cloudscape ; Julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up ; Julie and Monsieur Pig ( Peter Lorre ) bargaining for Verne 's freedom as the storm builds ; an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts . . .Above all , there is Paul Lukas 's dignified and detached performance as Hessler , a murderer who can appreciate Cambreau 's virtues , yet turns his back on him . In the film 's most arresting moment , Hessler , having left Cambreau , stands outside the cabin . We hear the wind through the jungle , see the shadows on his face , which conveys a moment of fear and self - doubt . Then he exits into the night . In this moment , Hessler achieves an ambiguity , depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve . is the film 's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler ?"	0
this is a great film!!!I first saw this film when it came out . I just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it . A lot of films we watched when we were younger do n't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life . The film is actually a great 80 's example of the type of films made then . Keaton is at his best , all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it . The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80 's is too funny . Being from the 80 's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again . The film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80 's film lovers .	1
The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster . You end up disliking most of the characters and you do n't particularly like any of them.Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really do n't care one bit about them . The movie has no plot , no direction and no purpose . The single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that 's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste .	0
Tom Hanks has been in such hit movies as Forrest Gump , Saving Private Ryan , and The Green Mile . For the most part , his roles have been good guys that we cheer for . In Road to Perdition , his character Michael Sullivanis a little bit different.In Sam Mendes ' film Road to Perdition based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins , he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago . What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hit - man who is now being hunted by his former partner . His boss or ex - boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) loves him almost more than his own son , Sullivan 's partner Connor ( Daniel Craig).After a job done the wrong way because of Connor , the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who was n't supposed to be there . So Connor tries to take out Sullivan and his family , but only gets the wife and other son Peter . Sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting . With his wife and child dead , Sullivan takes to the road to find answers.The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid , and for Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this . He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother . Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile . His loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town , leaving nothing behind him.Mendes ' previous hit film was American Beauty which received five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director . This film did n't do nearly as well at the Oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music , sound , and a Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Paul Newman . This picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan : husband , hit - man , and devoted father . This movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come .	1
"This film may have been the biggest let - down I 've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews . Overall , I simply found this to be a second - rate movie.Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful competence . On the other hand , Ma Wu 's makeup ( facial hair ) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously . He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween , complete with the $ 4.95 stick - on beard.The special effects were so - so , though the "" undead "" in the cellar were pretty good . The tree - tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick , though the POV shots from the tongue 's view more closely resembled Sam Raimi 's trademark shots in the more recent "" Evil Dead "" trilogy . The pyrotechnics were ho - hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get . ( In fact , it most closely reminded me of the "" Lost in Space "" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and .... ) < br />The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales . There was no suspense and no plot twists . In fact , you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good , who is bad , and who is going to survive.I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review . The very first thing I did was check the production date . Yep , it says 1987 ... not the 1967 that I thought it might be . And that pretty much sums it up : The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s . The plot and action seem much older , as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s.<br / > * * out of * * * * *"	0

Once more the dogs are the only "" actors "" that seem "" real "" and that s a stretch . Another wasted effort here . GRADE : D"	0
This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons . 1 ) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking , but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android . 2 ) It was n't an android at all , but a woman , the beautiful Jean Marsh.The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they 'd done it properly . In fact , the modernization of sex - bots are in the news as I speak.Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made , so they could have at least had her act like one . Her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element . Instead , it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity . Normally no one cared . But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine , or downright carelessness .	0
"Just a comment on New Orleans accents ... An earlier reviewer noted the following : "" This film , could have been shot in New York , or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like "" broklynese "" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country . "" There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer.Many people in New Orleans do , in fact , sound "" broklynese "" . I have never found out why . ( It 's mentioned in "" A Confederacy of Dunces "" by John Kennedy Toole . ) I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail , as this one did . Too often it 's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent ."	1
This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful . A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film . Many changes have been made to the storyline , presumably to streamline the timeframe . But what results is simply confusing . The acting ca n't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters ' motives for their behavior . Plus , the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban . Horrible . Please please please read the gorgeous novel , in Spanish if possible . DON'T SEE THIS FILM . It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience .	0
Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series , Four For Venice is not only awful , but really awful . So awful , that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession . Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth , where Eva works as a waitress and Luis , an artist . Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress . Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick . Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to London to do something related to his artwork , but the fact is , he is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday . Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation . The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another.The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy . It not only look senseless , but also draggy . In the film , Nick try to seek help for several ways , but it ends to no avail . It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons , or they are just simply dumb.The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story . While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense , no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem . They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.It fails so bad , that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film .	0
"I still do n't know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing . This "" film "" was n't worth the Memorex DVD - R it was burned on ; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents ' camcorder . This is by far the worst movie ever made . I truly , from the bottom of my heart , want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.So apparently , it 's supposed to be bad on purpose ; However , if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo - doo , you 'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick . The actors attempt dramatic kick - ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine.The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg . The camera angles are awful . The story is C - movie at best-- the plot is n't even good enough to be considered B - movie caliber . The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty , but is crap like everything else . Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies . Plus , the techno score is annoying ... not because it 's techno , but because it 's NON - STOP . That 's right , the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME , acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is . I do n't care what the disclaimer claims , I do n't buy it . BOTS was not made this bad on purpose , because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was : a joke.This "" film "" was very low - budget . But that is no excuse for its record - setting suck factor . Great films are born of substance , not budget . BOTS had neither.Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time : if I were having a three - way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on , I 'd be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision.Undoubtedly , some people will try to defend the movie . Two , maybe three . They 'll say , "" it 's grindhouse chop - socky ! "" or "" cheesy in a good way ! "" or "" it 's so bad , it 's good ! "" Those people are idiots . A movie is either good , or it 's bad . There 's no such thing as a good bad movie . But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies . Do n't get me wrong ; there are lots of cornball not - to - be - taken - seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining . Slither is one . BOTS is not.This suckfest runs about an hour and a half , and in my humble opinion , it 's 90 minutes too long . The best thing about this "" film "" is the DVD cover , so next time you 're near the Wal - Mart DVD bargain bin , take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT , just look-- and quietly walk away ."	0
"This reminds me of when I was a born - again believer who was going to be a minister . I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to Heaven before that would ever happen . That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch rubbish . I am now an atheist , and that just proves that the "" once saved always saved "" doctorine that Christians tell us is no more real than elves . If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer ? Yes , I really was saved . I prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart.If Christians were to read their Bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape , genocide , abortion , and many other atrocities are alright according to him . They might be surprised to learn that no where is the word "" rapture "" mentioned ."	0
Monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil American concrete factory ( are there any else in Hollywood ? ) polluting the waters of the small Colombian town of Chimayo somehow creating a catfish - like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women . James Mitchum is Bill Travis the man who is sent down to Chimayo by his foul - mouthed boss Barnes who himself ca n't keep his hands off of his secretary 's rear to get to the bottom ( pun intended ) of the story . While in Chimayo Bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect English directly back to America . I guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small South American towns . There is also a radical named Sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which , by the way , also supplies the town with jobs for the locals , but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy - feely enviro - marxism . Pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex - girlfriend on the beach , tells her that he is seeing the mayor 's daughter Juanita and it 's over between them , then she is promptly eaten that night . A little side action without the evidence . My hat is off to you Sir . John Carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by God to punish sinners . You can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face . Might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check did n't bounce.Supposedly based on a true story , so much so they say it twice in the opening credits , this film is awful on all fronts . Filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when Kenneth Hartford put his foot on the throat of Monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters , even putting his daughter , Andrea in top billing with Mitchum and Carradine . The sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming . This is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night . The monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending . James Mitchum along with his brother Chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed . Utterly unwatchable dreck . Shame on you John Carradine .	0
"It was almost worth sitting through this entire god - awful "" film "" just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again . Acting - 0 , script - 0 , fight scenes - 0 , male lead - 0 ( cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl ) , Nadia Bjorlin - 10 ( She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress ) . This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two . I lost count but I believe ever movie cliché , ever , is in this movie . When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her , from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement . Plus he just shows up for no reason . He was never even mentioned before . I do n't know what else to say here . Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years . At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials ."	0
"The only reason I watched the movie till the end was the "" hope "" to see something interesting . The movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really , really bad , honestly , I am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad.The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was : "" She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director "" ... surprise , surprise , next day after I watched the film I found out on internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife . Awful story and terrible performance ."	0
I recently watched the ' 54 version of this film with Judy , and while i appreciated the story and music , i found that the film failed to hold my attention . I expected the ' 76 remake to be the same story , except with a Barbra twist . I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame , money , love and the price of it all . This version is so much more real than the ' 54 one , with arguably better music , better acting , a more gripping plot line , and , of course , a deeper love . I do not understand why the previous film is on the American Film Institute 's top 100 list , while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic 's list .	1
""" Hollywood North "" is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto , in this case , later in Vancouver . Peter O'Brian , the director , probably saw a lot of the invaders from California that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that Canada presented.Needless to say , "" Moon Lantern "" , the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into "" Flight to Bogota "" , which has nothing to do with the original film . A great egotistical has - been , Michael Baytes , who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran , is offered the lead part , which turns to be a disaster.The film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth , which seems to be the case with the ultimate product , which is saved by its producer , Bobby Myers . With the help of Sandy Ryan , who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in Toronto , parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last.The filming process is hilarious , and the acting , in general , is good ."	1
OK , so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.I pity the fools who still think so ... Its absolute rubbish.The story is just ... ridiculous . The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise , i m sure its meant to be a serious drama is n't it?Dean and others , are too old for their parts . People say Dean is great in this film , and well , maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could 've . His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so . But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film . Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... its pathetic.Natalie Wood is gorgeous , but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing . It sets a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest of it , you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.It may've been good for its time , but , really , its drivel.It must 've just been hype about Dean 's death that has over - inflated the reputation of this film .	0
My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile . The movie is not supposed to be funny at all , but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever . First , Phillippe ( I forget what his character is called and I do n't really care ) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top - security terminals . Not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so - scary Lego - room , which hosts the super computers . This is plain funny . The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room . The ending , like all else , is very very very cheesy , especially when the bad guy 's lawyer shows up ' right on time ' . Anyway , this movie is a good laugh . If you need something to make fun of , definitely see it .	0
My observations : vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful , exotic and fantastic . Jeanette wore it well , and got even with naive Nelson . Boat crashing into his balcony served him right . Costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well , especially by today 's standards . 1942 costume designer did great job . Main song theme just lovely.Caution to negative posters : 1942 was time of WW II ; Pearl Harbor happened year before . U.S. just coming out of Great Depression ; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing , dance and yes , fantastic fantasy . Despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in RL , snuffing out freedoms . Thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend . Movie going was a privileged treat , in those depressing times . When you , negative posters , become actors or even movie stars , then YOU have room to talk and criticize . Jeanette 's and Nelson 's movies stand the test of time.Angel wings wonderful , on the real angel . RL wings at costume party not so hot , but great on Jeanette considering the SL.Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson , as always . Jeanette dancing was a pure delight.15/10	1
"Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it 's still an awful film . If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke ..... first off , Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man 's Gerard Depardieu ..... naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the ' Iron Mask ' three musketeer one . Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that . The poor man 's box office poison .... really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised . If the ' 4th Man ' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie .... what am i saying ? it is n't . Let 's just say hypothetically , if it was supposed to be , it was n't sharp enough . Satire is a tricky thing .... if it is n't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead ...... i think that is what happened . The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either ..... (for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film .... very sharp satire)[potential spoiler alert]Really , the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé 's character works so so hard to attain .... do you even care ? is it funny ? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control ..... though i 'm guessing he did n't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he 's the worst actor and every character he 's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass .... except he 's incompetent at it . So it becomes like a weird caricature . Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose ? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well ? I just do n't see it ...... So you understand the dilemma i 'm faced with here right ? It is the worst film ever because he 's supposed to be a good director . So there is some kind of dupery involved . I knew ' Patch Adams ' was horrible without even seeing it . Do not be duped by ' The 4th Man""s deceptively alluring packaging or mr . Voerhoven 's reputation as a good director etc . etc ."	0
The world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2 . < br />The 24 episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it . The first episode tells us how the Hitler came to power , and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world . They also fucus on the military actions taken during the war , and the holocaust . One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made . All of you must watch this . Perfection ! 10/10 < br /><br / >	1
This had to be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and I 'm 64 years old and a football fan . I went expecting to see a football movie . About 10 minutes into it , I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie ( particularly the acting ) could have gotten into a theater . About half way through , I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie . Although I was a little offended ( and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian ) at being preached to in a movie theater , it was n't that big a deal . It was , however , a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and , above all , the quality of the acting . It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater . Do I go to church ? Yes . Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie ? No . Would I recommend this movie ? Absolutely not ! ! !	0
If you have seen very less films , this might be a big one for you . If you have seen lot of films , this is a joke . The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly . Not to mention , there are songs , there are lot of flashbacks , and most importantly , the fighting scenes are stupidily performed . New characters , good direction , would have done a better job , but since it contains all the bollywood heros / heroines , you can predict what s going to happen next . You do not feel sad when something happens , the emotions they protray is terrible , mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies . It suppose to be a realistic movie , but it fails to show . There are times you wondering , you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them . Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid ? There were only a few characters acting that was very good , but as far it is concerned with plot , action , it is poorly directed . This movie could have been short if they took out songs , flashbacks , stick to the point .	0
Amazing acting , music . A simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through . I do n't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was . So many of the characters were so real . It moved me and made me think I would like to watch more like this.The idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom.The film tackles issues of religion , prejudice , drugs friendship , memories , difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself .	1
this , is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene , the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries , but without the sex , the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find , possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever , the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films , why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me , if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed I would be nicer in this review but they do n't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students , DO NOT buy this movie . the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights ! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER unbelievable GARBAGE ! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that .	0
I waited for this movie to come out for a while in Canada , and when it finally did , I was very excited to see it . I really enjoyed it . Of course , in the beginning , it is a very sad movie ( and it was New Years Day - making it even sadder ) - however , it sticks with you . The next day I was thinking about it again , because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining , you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story . How one person can be seen as the link to so many people , but sometimes you can be blinded so many things . And how Diane Keaton 's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there . And how they save her in the process as well . It was such an excellent movie , and Chris Pine ( one of my favourite actors ) provides the perfect comic relief . It is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues , but will really stay with you for a long time .	1
"When it comes to the erotic genre , I 'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch . This movie is different . Julie Davis ( I love You Do n't Touch Me ) directed two very strong lead actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this enthralling thriller . Kira is convincing as "" Kim "" a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of Doug Jeffery 's "" The Man "" a handsome stranger . Kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role , and as actress , giving what could have been simply another T and A depth and believability . I believe it to be her best performance yet . And Julie Davis ' direction is a great gift to erotica ."	1
I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes ! When I first purchased Casper & Friends : Spooking About Africa , I so much wanted to see the very first Casper cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost ( 1945 ) , But when I saw the next cartoon , There 's Good Boos To - Night ( 1948 ) , It made me break down ! I could n't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper 's fox get killed ! I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons ! This is the saddest one of all ! It was so depressing , I just could n't watch it again . It 's just like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie . I know it 's a classic , But it 's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me ! If I wanted to watch something old and classic , I rather watch something happy and funny ! But when I think about this Casper cartoon , I think about my cats !	1
"The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion , the historical innacuracies are not . I do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary , but some important aspects are missing , especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it.Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation , which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph , in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons , one of which was Samir Kuntar , a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for "" klinghoffer samir kuntar "" on google . Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations , even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro . Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC , did he?<br / > * * * possible spoilers * * * < br />The movie almost excuses the terrorists ' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived , always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israeli 's have done to hurt them . However , they never portray the hurt that the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis . The movie uses ( quite horrid ! ! ! ) images from the Sabra and Chatila horror , and nothing is said , understating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible , without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian - les Lebanese army who conducted the massacre.The acting was generally very bad , but I guess that 's what can be expected from opera singers?On another note I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists , and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism . Imagine how unsympathetic his wife was , spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea . I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is(wink wink )"	0
Even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s , ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending ) . It is sooooo preposterous . Apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal . Watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not - so - good - but very - bad way . So many scenes just look ludicrous : a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked , Suzanne Sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed , Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper , Bernie Casey faking a gam leg , and the list goes on and on . The peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls . The cast for the film is not bad on paper , but none of these actors seem to believe in the material . Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror . I hope she found a good use for the money , for it is obvious that was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense . Although it is quite a bad film , it is watchable - once for me , and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start - studded actors embarrassing themselves , that made - for - TV feel , and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man . This time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected . Really quite dreadful .	0
Franco Rossi 's 1985 six - hour Italian mini - series of Quo Vadis is a very curious beast , creating an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world shot in matter of fact fashion ( very few long shots , no big cityscapes ) , but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background.The shifting structure ( much of episode one is played out via voice over letters ) and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six - hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding , and certainly far too often uninvolving , but it has something going for it . The two main strengths are the characterisation of Petronius ( a thankfully dubbed Frederic Forrest , whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue ) as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he 's become incapable of experiencing emotion , and Klaus Maria Brandauer 's unique take on Nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his ' audience ' will receive it . Elsewhere , Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes , being rewarded with the show 's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave Rome . It 's the kind of thing the show could do with more of , but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional , inspiring or exciting moment under it 's relentlessly low - key direction.Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero , blending in with the walls and coming over less as a Roman officer than that quiet , slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties - you know , the one who you think is called Dave or something like that . The budgetary limitations are very visible once its Meet the Lions time for the Christians and Ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends.Not a trip I can particularly recommend , I 'm afraid , but if you do embark on it it 's one not entirely without its small rewards .	0
I saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago ( 1969 ) . Although I can now only remember bits of it , I long to see it again . The parts I remember , rightly or wrongly , include Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy , offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him . The music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of Gone With The Wind and I would love to hear it again . There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available . Anyone know why ? I doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest .	1
Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next . Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work . Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better . Look for a brief appearance by country singing star Dwight Yoakam . This is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments . What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort !	1
"I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago , I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity . The first few scenes alone were hilarious . I wo n't spoil anything for those who wish to see it , I would n't want to ruin the laughs . Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing . Towards the end we all got bored however , as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off . There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting . The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten "" Learn to Read "" book . They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting ."	0
Ah , the spirit of ' 68 . The streets of Paris were running wild with rebellion , the hippies were high on the spirit of love . How was Britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution ? Erm , by the looks of it , dear Old Blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools . If ... contains the evil establishment . It contains the uprising of the oppressed . What it lacks in contrast to the Parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement , except in its all - out ammo - and - artillery fire ending.Lindsay Anderson 's If ... stars the ever - marvellous Malcolm McDowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of Lenin and other left - wing radicals . It 's clearly an anti - establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper - class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish - posh public school standard . What makes If ... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies , it does n't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system , instead it just kind of floats : lacking in plot and lacking in personality.Surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black - and - white to colour again ( is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression ? ) , but there is little of interest to speak of . All we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment . Hooray ! A revolution ! At last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming.If ... could have been a powerful political statement , but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end . Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late - Sixties , it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper - class British education . Anarchy ? Apathy more like , the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching If ... will be Lindsay Anderson .	0
I ca n't say this is one of the best films I have ever seen . But then again , I ca n't say it 's one of the worst I have ever seen.OK , so it 's basically a girl does skating , is good at it , wants to go to an expensive school , ca n't afford it and has to take a Hockey Scholarship . She has to hide her skating secret from her friends.Personally , I did n't like the actress playing Katelin . She absolutely could n't cry to save her life , just made wailing sounds , like a toddler pretending to cry to get it 's own way.Katelin was just an annoying person . The way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people . Also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she ' draws the line ' made me cringe.We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer . Classically they did n't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical.Overall , I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you do n't mind the main skater being extremely annoying . It 's good to kill time basically .	0
when you add up all the aspects from the movie --- the dancing , singing , acting --- the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication , energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her . Never have i ever seen someone portray Rose with such vibrancy ! Vanessa 's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me ! Her dancing is so incredible , even if as some people say the choreography was bad --- her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before ! I 'd recommend this version over the ' 63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by Vanessa is superb-----not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well ( with the exception of Chynna Philips ... what in hell were they thinking when they cast her?)All in all I 'd say this version is wonderful and I recommend that everyone see this version !	1
"Tenchu aka . Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs ( together with Goyokin , HAra Kiri & Rebellion ) to the best chambara movies existing.Its the story about Shintaro Katsu ( who plays Okada Izo ) working for Nakadei , who wants to become the daymio . Okada , being the "" cleaner "" for Nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to Nakadei.But there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! < br />(Tenchu means Heavens Punishment )"	1
What starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing . Do n't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors , there is no ending . No explanation , no resolution , zip . This could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script .	0
"I mean the word "" pedestrian "" . Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen . Faith Domergue can do better than this . She is supposed to be the mysterious , vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson ( there 's an idea , eh ? ) . Instead she 's a common would - be housewife of the fifties , and the single , flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee . As for the rest of the cast , they are all so earnestly "" all - American "" that the result is laughable . This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in "" The Cat People "" . I think "" Cult of the Cobra "" should really be titled "" Cult of the Contractual Obligation "" . Why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow - moving , predictable , derivative failure like this ?"	0
"I gave it a 10 , since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to . The reason I 'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on Castle 's work.I've seen "" Homicidal "" and "" The Tingler "" ( the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white ) a few times and "" The House On Haunted Hill "" many times.Even I am not old enough to have seen them when Castle was up to his showman tricks , thus I can appreciate them for their own merit . And while most pass him off as second - rate , schlocky , hammy , etc . , I believe they do him a disservice.The end sequence of "" Homicidal "" is GENUINELY shocking and works today - and the premise of "" The Tingler "" while silly , was highly original.But "" The House On Haunted Hill "" was a TRIUMPH . Having used that Frank Lloyd Wright house as its exterior , the great Vincent Price and a solid cast , plus a good score and production values - when I first saw it at a packed late - night showing in the late Sixties , it produced an audience reaction I 'd not seen before and have not seen since.It was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement ( if you 've not seen the film , stop reading NOW ) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall.With NO telegraphing of what is coming , the camera slowly pulls back , forcing the AUDIENCE to switch their gaze to ... I 'm saying no more ( my "" spoiler "" declaration above only covers THIS movie).The point is , I believe this ploy was DELIBERATE - not accidental - and when it happened , the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED ( including most of the men ! ) It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm down.Now THAT is superior film - making . A flamboyant showman he might have been , but "" House "" and the other two films I 've mentioned were GOOD MOVIES . Castle may not have been a Hitchcock , but he was no Ed Wood , either.It 's easy to concentrate on someone 's quirks and forget to examine their TALENT . So I hope this documentary acknowledged that . I look forward to seeing it ."	1
I do n't think I 've ever felt this let down by a film before . After loving Guy Ritchie 's two previous films ( I do n't count Swept Away - he was pussy blind ) , I was so looking forward to seeing this . < br />The reviews were poor , then again , I do n't trust the press anyway . More worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker , so it was with some trepidation I handed over my £ 4.80 yesterday afternoon.I'm not even going to try to explain this film , mainly because I have n't got a clue what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who did n't get it ! < br />Unfortunately I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife 's trap of taking himself far too seriously . It seems it was n't good enough for him to make films with good plots , laughs , snappy dialogue and good characters . It 's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off , here are some of the ones I noticed:The Matrix , Fight Club , Kill Bill , The Usual Suspects , Vanilla Sky ... I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors , Jason Statham and Ray Liotta , were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down.So a big , big thumbs down from me .	0
the tortuous emotional impact is degrading , whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all . This movie has a plot , but it is all evil from start to end . This is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie . teen killing - bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red , blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace , what a bad mistake to make , or to watch ... it is UGLY	0
This is one of the first independent movies I 've ever seen . For such a very low budget , it was done well ; as an insomniac myself , I can sympathize with the main character , although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing . < br />Well directed , well acted , of a subject that I have n't seen much in theaters , lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting . There are few noticeable goofs , but they may be intended ; you 'll see after you watch the movie . The movie is very personal , and worth watching twice . No movie is flawless , but a Hollywood version could n't do the story better . all in all , 8/10 .	1
"Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have left well - enough alone when he made "" Criminally Insane "" 10 years before the release of this god - awful waste of time and effort . The fact that the original "" Criminally Insane "" was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it ... but instead he opts to use TONS of footage from the original in this one as well , even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence ! Unfortunately , bringing back the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save this one . What little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand - held camcorder ! If this film cost more than $ 100 to make I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount ! Avoid this one and watch the original instead !"	0
"Back in the 1970s , WPIX ran "" The Adventures of Superman "" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years . Every once in a while , we 'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air "" Superman and the Mole Men . "" I always looked forward to those days . Watching it recently , I was surprised at just how bad it really was.It was n't bad because of the special effects , or lack thereof . True , George Reeves ' Superman costume was pretty bad , the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible . And true , the Mole Men 's costumes were even worse . What was supposed to be a furry covering would n't have fooled a ten year - old , since the zippers , sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious . But these were forgivable shortcomings.No , what made it bad were the contrived plot devices . Time and again , Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating . A lynch mob is searching for the creatures ? Rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself , he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man . The creatures are cornered ? Again , he stands around watching and talking but does n't save them until they 're shot . Luke Benson , the town 's rabble - rouser , shoots at him ? Attempted murder to any reasonable person , but Superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems . Superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud , but never once took advantage of them.That said , both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well , seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles . If only they had been given a better script to work with ."	0
For domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie . For outsiders , with no vested interests , it did not make much sense . The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes . The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction . How a young woman could ' love ' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense . How she could , as mentioned at the end of the movie , never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me . I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh . Several hundred German troops advanced , pushing the Russians into the marsh . So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening . I suppose they did not want to get their boots wet , but I am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh . But that would have ended the story . Also , the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof . At the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in.I did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end . I wonder why ? You knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart - tugging in that .	0
Sexo Cannibal , or Devil Hunter as it 's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences , starts with actress & model Laura Crawford ( Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner ) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane ( Gisela Hahn ) . After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character 's named Chris ( Werner Pochath ) & Thomas ( Antonio Mayans ) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane . Laura 's agent gets on the blower to rent - a - hero Peter Weston ( Al Cliver ) who is informed of the situation , the kidnappers have Laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom . Peter is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely & a further 10 % of the 6 million if he brings that back as well , faster than a rat up a drain pipe Peter & his Vietnam Vet buddy helicopter pilot Jack are on the island & deciding on how to save Laura . So , the kidnappers have Laura & Peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much . Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe ( hell , in all the generations they 've lived there they 've only managed to build one straw hut , now that 's primitive ) who worship some cannibal monster dude ( Burt Altman ) with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young , white female flesh & intestines ... This Spanish , French & German co - production was co - written & directed by the prolific Jesus Franco who also gets the credit for the music as well . Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the UK as it was placed on the ' Video Nasties ' list in the early 80 's under it 's alternate Devil Hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned , having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film & even Franco , who is n't afraid to be associated with a turkey , decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of Clifford Brown . I 'd imagine even the most die - hard Franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing . The script by Franco , erm sorry I mean Clifford Brown & Julian Esteban as Julius Valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed , is awful . It 's as simple & straight forward as that . For a start the film is so boring it 's untrue , the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I 've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things do n't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over - sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes . As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success , this is one to avoid.Director Franco shows his usual incompetence throughout , a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it 's not attached to anything ! The cannibal scenes are poor , the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from ' A ' to ' B ' & not really doing anything when they get there either . It becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & do n't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it 's uncut state . I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff , this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it 's side & having Cliver crawl along the floor ! Just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along ! The gore is n't that great & as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame , there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat , a man is impaled on spikes , there 's some blood & a handful of intestines . There 's a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene.Sexo Cannibal must have had a low budget & I mean low . This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values . The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic . The music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen . The acting sucks , the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act.Sexo Cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell . The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross . Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible , one to avoid .	0
OK .. this movie could have been soooo good ! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie . The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen , whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with . Sophia Miles was , simply , fantastic , as Lady P and Bill Paxton , whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being , was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.It 's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film , it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20 . Seriously , these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.The film did n't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical . It tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face . 3/10 ( 2 for the machines , 1 for Lady P )	0
Although I have not seen this mini - series in over twenty years I can still remember how the balance between character , plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded . The use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story . The two versions I 've seen were dubbed ( English and French)but the actors appear to speak their own language not just Italian so there is a synchronization problem . It does not spoil the story telling . Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable to North Americans . Recommended to all followers of Odysseus ' ever returning .	1
This movie was amusing at times , hell sometimes it was even downright funny.The underlying message I got from the film though , was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man . Every time a woman is depicted in the film , she is being lazy , being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason . I do n't think the message involved is good for women or gay men.But , it is a comedy , and a piece of art , so it is simply someones point of view . Even if I do n't agree with it , they are still entitled to it.An amusing film , but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid . Best film ever my foot .	0
Not very impressed . Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film , because there is almost no development in the plot . Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . The acting seems very poor as well , and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television . Although this is difficult to tell with the female role , Yuwen , as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time . < br />Tian Zhuangzhuang 's film the ' Blue Kite ' was a far better film . But do n't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late ' 40s . Unlike the Blue Kite , the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself , the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who ca n't tell the difference between a film that is ' beautiful ' ' profound ' or ' hypnotic ' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.If any film fits the description of ' overrated , ' this is it . I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry .	0
"And , finally , old , old Michael Corleone falls over and goes ' THUMP ! ' Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga ? Probably the same staff who does "" As the World Turns . "" This flick does n't deserve the title "" Godfather "" at all . Let 's call this one "" The Cosas of Our Nostras "" or "" All My Capos "" . As someone who 's encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life , I can say without exception , that I 've never met any mobster as inwardly - conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone . Let 's face it , these guys are in the Mafia solely because they 're greedy , nothing more . In this film , Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future , perhaps even the Afterlife , then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is , deep down . Then , there 's his failed marriage . After the break - up scenes in G2 , we may hope that Michael & Kay will reunite as man and wife , but here they seem to just become very good , platonic friends who can laugh & cry & share intimate thoughts about their lives . It 's as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman . It 's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years . There 's some miscasting here and there , or perhaps they 're sins of authorship . Poor , old - country - beautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role , with too many short lines in the film that do n't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations - was given "" remarks "" rather than "" lines "" to emote . Her ' passionate ' lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open - mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes ... scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas , but it 's just laughable here . Then , there 's Andy 's character , Vinnie Mancini , who 's also given a difficult & thankless role to play . He 's expected , I guess , to be the new , new Don Corleone , but he 's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position , unlike Michael 's simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1 . This hand - me - down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family , but why is so much made of this boring routine ? Certainly , Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday , but there 's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man , sadly . Puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing Michael 's character in G1 . But , G3 has no economy in it 's story - telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze . Thirdly , George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task , in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen . George wisely underplayed his role , so it came off without damage to the actor . The development of Connie Corleone 's character is interesting , but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands ( she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos , if this were the real world ) . But , it 's not all bad . The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty ! Also , "" they keep pulling me back in "" or words to that effect is a great line . And , we recover some old - country feel as we get to go back to Sicily , even if it 's all done in 1989 and they 've got modern cars & haircuts . The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting , since it 's based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980 's , but it 's brought too far , again , with the too - spectacular death scenes , etc . The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed . But , the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional - manipulation , at best . All screenwriters need to learn that we do n't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion . You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead , she plays her grief so well , but Michael 's reaction is hammy , hammy , hammy . Then , Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century , in Sicily , alone on a grand estate , of heart - failure ... no grandson to play with before his demise , no wife to grieve for him . What SHOULD have happened in the last 1/2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani , put on trial , all his dirty family 's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day , Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life ... then he can keel over dead from heart - failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH . That 's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80 's and early 90 's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved ."	0
Classic , highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece ! Carpenter 's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt ! The direction often consists of such simple elements , shadows , dark streets , creaking doors , that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy . Carpenter well - times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling , that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage ! Plus , he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong . Highest kudos also go to Carpenter 's simple , yet frighteningly unnerving music score . In a sense , Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!The cast is excellent . Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode , she 's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films . The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer 's doctor , who 's desperate to capture him again . Supporting cast Loomis , Soles , Castle , and others are good too.So like its own villain , Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill . It is a MUST for all genre fans!<br / > * * * * out of * * * *	1
I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews but I do know that , as happens often on Amazon.com , there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same , somewhat obscure talking points , almost verbatim . A campaign ? Only IMDb knows.As for this movie : it 's fine . It 's a funny , cute and very straightforward movie.It 's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn , lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx . But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids . Is the grandmother a bizarre character ? Yup . Do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this ? Yes , thankfully , they do . Are other movies set in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible ? You betcha . Does that make this movie a crime  as some of the ( to my eyes , astroturf ) comments would suggest ? Hardly . Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR . High or Degrassi High . Scoff at the comparison but _ we 've never had that _ and I 'm touched , to the core , by this movie 's humility of purpose and tender spirit.That said , I 'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting ! :-D	1
This movie is about a side of Ireland that Americans do n't normally see , the narrow - minded religiously prejudiced side of the ' friendliest race in the world ' . The movie , by the admission of the inhabitants of Fethard who are old enough to remember the events , is fairly accurate ( though they insist that the film - makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action).The movie was very unpopular in Ireland as it portrayed the Catholic church in a bad light , but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic church * did * organise vetoes of minorities ( before Protestants it was the Jews).The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland	1
"Finally , the uncut version of "" Baby Face "" surfaces and from what source ? The Library of Congress . The restored four minutes , snippets here and there , make for a much better film . We now know that Baby Face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age . Another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold , calculating exterior.Barbara Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers ( notice the moniker ) , a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power , cunning , and revenge , yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for , a very difficult portrayal to make convincing . Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top ( literally ) , she still has good in her heart -- note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as Chico ( the marvelous actress Theresa Harris ) and the old philosopher . And though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful , those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her.Lily Powers fails to understand , at first , that emotions are difficult to ride , that it 's easy to lose control . One possible result is death . Hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral , and it 's a cold lonely location.A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in "" Baby Face "" by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man . "" Baby Face "" was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany . Though it 's highly unlikely that the semi - literate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche , he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings . "" Baby Face "" serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche 's will to power concept , especially in the final scenes.Although "" You 've got the cutest little baby face . "" is apropos as a theme for "" Baby Face , "" an even more telling and applicable melody is W. C. Handy 's "" St. Louis Blues "" played throughout the film , especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes . "" St. Louis Blues "" is also used wisely toward the end as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values . Chico is singing a raw , salacious version of "" St. Louis Blues "" when Lily , now disagreeing with the lyrics , orders her to stop.The restored version of "" Baby Face "" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new Hollywood release . By all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy ."	1
This is an amazing film , both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing , and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it . Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience . This is not ' Bizet 's Carmen ' by any usual standard . This is not a usual film by any standard . Every nuanced glance , every stomp of the foot , every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you ca n't take your eyes off the screen . You do n't need to love opera or flamenco(I don't)to be captured , enraptured , enthralled by this film . Subtle and direct ; loud and still ; One of , if not the best , movies of it 's kind , because there are so few like it .	1

OK , I did n't have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine.The plot , as it were , involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater . The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui . Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation .... we'll move on.I'll layout the plot w/o giving much away : the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate . He brings with him a mental patient ( I 'm not making this up ) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him ( not one lick of this BTW is explained ) , a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal . They get to Rome , find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film , meet with a bondage gear S&M anti - pope that the drunk Irish guy knows ( not explained ) and who gives information by killing people ( oh , BTW , he 's a bad guy so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack ) and then ... umm , seriously , I 'm not sure . the plot meanders about . Heath chills with the Sin Eater , flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then ( all off camera ) the anti - pope falls and the film ends.About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened . By the end something has happened but you ca n't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off - scren you 're really feeling cheated .	0

"The only thing I knew about this film prior to seeing it was Robby The Robot . My preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci - fi flicks that the 1950 's was noted for . How wrong I was . Big studio , big budget and big production values make this a strong contender , at least visually , for the best sci - fi film coming out of the era . I qualify with the word visually , because "" War Of The Worlds "" is a lot darker and scarier than "" Forbidden Planet "" , and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.What impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography , followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in Dr. Morbius ' ( Walter Pidgeon ) home and laboratory . But that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake , the labyrinthine underground that served as the Krell stronghold . It appeared that Krell technology was even more advanced than say , that of "" Star Wars "" . Which made me consider , audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with SW , or in 1986 with "" Aliens "" . Watching it on a large screen TV in my living room offered me the same effect , and I 'm fairly resistant to hyperbole.It 's not too much of a stretch to imagine "" Forbidden Planet "" as a direct antecedent of the ' Star Trek ' TV series ; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show . Followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in ' Star Trek ' . I had to do a double take when the men of United Planets Cruiser C57-V headed for a transporter room , while the conundrum presented to Robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the ST series.Where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of ' monsters from the I d ' . That Morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend Altaire IV was certainly a unique concept for 1956 , when every other sci - fi flick of the time was dealing with Martians or other grotesque space creatures . The film worked it 's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that Morbius was the protector of Altaire IV some time before Commander Adams ( Leslie Nielsen ) explained it.You know , looking at the calendar , the year 2200 is n't that far off . This movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets . I think though , that they 'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of Robby ."	1
"Larry Buchanan . Yep , same guy who did "" Attack of the THE Eye Creatures "" and two ( count 'em : TWO ) conspiracy movies about Marilyn Monroe . He 's to blame , here.Adding onto his ever - growing pile of folders left over from Oliver Stone 's "" eh - I - grew - out - of - it "" conspiracy drawer , here 's "" Down On Us ( i.e.- "" Beyond the Doors "" ) which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy.Forget everything you THOUGHT you knew about Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison , says Big Lar ' , cuz this is the real deal ! Y'see , the three big names in rock of the ' 60s were KILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversives or counter - productive to Truth , Justice and the American Way , or sumpthin ' like that there . I knew it all along.Anyway , three people ( Chatman , Meryl , Wolf ) who look eerily like their real life shadows ( that is , if you completely close your eyes , turn your backs and walk five miles away from them ) show that instead of their recorded deaths , the good old US of A put hits out on them ! Yep , it 's the truth!Man , I can not believed I watched this movie . It 's facts , when not stretching credibility to the snapping point , are ludicrous ; the acting makes TV commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end , you deserve the "" twist "" ending . You really , really do ; I swear . Genius.But like the man said : "" Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll . ""Not this flick , though.No stars for "" Down on Us "" . And that 's the movie audience describing the film , by the way ...."	0
"Though the movie may have been "" true "" to Lewis 's book ( in that the script was basically word - for - word , verbatim ) , it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . The mythical creatures ( unicorns , centaurs , griffins , ghouls , ghosts ) are * drawn * in , and as in the previous review , the green - screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow . I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ; I nearly cried when I heard the wolf 's "" howl-- "" a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.All of the acting is tremendously forced , especially that of little Lucy Penvensie ... I could only take so much indignation , desperation , and buck teeth in the ( what felt like ) fourteen hours of watching the movie . The actress who plays the White Witch , in all her histrionics , seems that she 'd be more at home on stage , where a booming voice , spread arms , and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome . < br />The sets feel claustrophobic , whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors . Indoors , it 's as if BBC could only afford to spend $ 100 on constructing a set , and so it is very small , and all the characters are constantly huddled together . The White Witch 's castle is a run - down , rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting . When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually , * any * scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles . < br />The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan , but you can bet that BBC probably blew the film 's entire budget on building the mechanical feline . It looks great when it 's standing still and before it starts speaking , but once it starts moving , you ca n't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear - end in the lion suit . < br />Yes , if you are a hardcore Narnia fan , you may want to see this version , simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote-- but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter , and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen . During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers ' and getting ready to flee from the wolves , Mrs. Beaver 's incessant , "" oh , just ONE more thing , dearies , and then we will be ready to go , "" punctuated by the children 's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of "" NO , Mrs. Beaver , PLEASE ! "" -- a scene of comic relief , so incongruous ( they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger , not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not ) , detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have . In fact , the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these . < br />I would recommend seeing the new Narnia ( Disney 2005 ) . The new movie , with updated effects , spectacular computer animation , great timing all around , and a gorgeous and scene- stealing White Witch ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician , as opposed to a shrieking banshee ) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewis 's original vision ( I think ) . Lucy is a lot cuter ( NO buck teeth , YAY ! ) , as are the beavers ( and realistically - sized ) , and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine , Desperately - Hungry - for - Acceptance - Insecure - and- Angsting - with - an - Inferiority - Complex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts . < br />Unless you 're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies , I would not recommend this film to anyone ."	0
Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly . You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter which makes everything very murky . The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing . There are echoes of ' Bride Of The Monster ' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about , the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining . Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the ' sci - fi ' music score , repeated endlessly , will drive you insane . If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time .	0
"I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers . I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared . Yet I remember it pretty well , with a nice twist or two , and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm . Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career , and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead . I definitely recommend it as a rental , although some of the themes , which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 , now may seem tame , which is a shame , considering that contemporary "" edginess "" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool , sort of like clamoring just to get noticed ."	1
"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach , now the famous Crowbar Night - club . It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home . It 's got everything ; the generation gap , the sexual revolution , the quest for success , and the conflict between following one 's family "" traditions "" to those of seeking ones own way through life.It was a fast paced , highly enjoyable movie . Vegas was at it 's hippiest peak , Sin City in all it 's glory . Beautiful women , famous cameos , laughs , conflict , romance , and even a happy ending . A very enjoyable time over all . < br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall . I look at it and I go back in time ; a time of my youth and my times with my dad , a great time in my life ."	1
"In the film "" Brokedown Palace , "" directed by Jonathan Kaplan , two best friends , Alice ( Claire Danes ) and Darlene ( Kate Beckinsale ) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii , but hear that Bangkok , Thailand , is much more fun . They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans . While they were in Thailand , Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks ( Daniel Lapaine ) . He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong . They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs . They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison . < br />I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever . Also , a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face . Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever . Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made . Sometimes life is not fair , that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made.This movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand . This film also has great music ; a few of my favorite songs are ' Silence ' by Delerium , ' Damaged ' by Plumb , ' Deliver me ' by Sarah Bightman and ' Party 's just begun ' by Nelly Furtado . I went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film . These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly , a mistake that anyone could make , therefore this film is good for any audience . It makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes . Even though , I did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs ? -- I would definitely give this film two thumbs up ."	1
Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps . I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title . But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends . I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was . If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film . I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video . there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune . Listen to the cd.dont watch this its awful . 1 out of 10	0

The Night Listener is probably not one of William 's best roles , but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie . I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before . Some people maybe wo n't like the slow pacing of this movie , but I think it 's the great plus of the movie . It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 . It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content , dramatic feeling . This is no americanized movie . Neither is it a predictable movie . You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be . This is no excellent movie that has everything , but hell , it 's a damn good and very original movie .	1
"The main complaint with this film is the fact that I CAN NOT tell who is who . No racism intended , but these Asians look all the same ! I can tell somewhat of the story , but heck that s about as far as it goes . The peoples identities are not a mystery , if they were a mystery I would care about them . Instead I was n't them off the screen ASAP.Tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie . Heck is it boring , not only do I not know these people , but they are just sitting there.The production is typical Chinese John Woo , terrible video with blotched scenes . This looks only slightly better than Andy Lau 's "" Fulltime Killer "" ( Which was a great movie . ) You would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s Hollywood . I did n't know the Chinese had these art - house beatniks ."	0
Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time . It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience . I have to say that while I agree films do n't have to make sense to be enjoyable ( see MULHOLLAND DRIVE ) they still have to engage you with the characters . Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch 's opus , I have to say I could n't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world . < br />Also , while so many people seem to try and say you did n't enjoy because you did n't get it I would have to disagree - I did n't enjoy because I was bored . I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help . Call it clever if you will - I think it 's repetitious.However , my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw . Just music over black . Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR 's pretentiousness ? Or , did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed ? ? ?	0
Definitely spoilers in this review ! I * * adore * * American Gothic and have done since I first saw it late at night when it first aired on Ch4 in the UK when I was 14 . The comparisons made to Stephen King are just about right . It 's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters . Best of all , and the reason I love it so much , is it had the guts to never be black and white ! Lucas Buck though lacking any conscience often works by , as he says , giving people enough rope to hang themselves with . His manipulation only works because of other people 's weak morals . Caleb though generally a thoughtful , kind , insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father . None of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic Merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in The Plague Sower . Not only that but having Gail , the closest thing to a mother figure for Caleb , not only sleep with but fall in love with Lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it . I 'm a huge Buffy fan , but when that show tried to go really ' dark ' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it 's humorous side and did n't commit fully to its ideas . AG shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show , and still have a hell of laugh doing it.I ca n't even think about why it was cancelled as I 'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all . So much rubbish on TV and good , original shows get kicked around and stamped on . Thanks to the emergence of DVD at least I can see the show in it 's entirety ! Yes some of the visuals look dated now , but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines . The actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work.The only reason why I think someone may not like this show is that it is n't like the X - files where there are cases to ' solve ' or Lost where there 's huge unanswered questions . It 's pretty obvious from the get go that Lucas Buck has some kind of evil powers , and that the show is all about fighting for Caleb 's soul . So this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown ' truth ' to find . Yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects , with some such as the truth about Gails parents getting resolved , but unlike Lost and X - files this show is n't about trying to find out more ' facts ' about what 's going on IMO . It 's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of Trinity . Personally I would just get such a kick out of seeing Lucas turn every situation to his advantage.All in all the main thing I have to say is CHECK IT OUT . I 'm pretty certain most fantasy / horror fans will LOVE it . Also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure . The only hanging thread I felt was Dr Matt . Having him not be in the final episodes is strange . < br />I would have done anything for a second season , but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some TV execs appear to be I should be glad this wonderful show got made at all ! ! !	1
"I 've seen a great many films , but ' In Cold Blood ' stands alone in a class by itself . It excels in every department . The fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story , rather than the name on the marquee . Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo . The fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place , even inside the very house , add additional chills . The black / white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent . There are many outstanding cinematic works out there , but if I could only vote for one to top the list , it would most probably be "" In Cold Blood "" ."	1
"After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex - rental DVDs , I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes ? For a number of reasons , "" American Beauty "" does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch "" Big "" without wanting a cat to kick ) , I 'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it.Normally squeaky - clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930 's . He is also a professional hit - man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . But after his eldest ( Tyler Hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up . Soon , father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit - man ( a menacing Jude Law ) is waiting for them.On the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . It 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . Hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan 's son . In all honesty , there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . As is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often I praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . Chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . True time - travel , even if a little CGI is needed.The story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you do n't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster . The film is decidedly noir - ish , driving rain and ill - lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy - Gun shootouts and extortion rackets . It can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun - play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . Mendes has delivered a fine follow - up to his Oscar - winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . "" Road To Perdition "" may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon ."	1
"SLASHERS ( 2 outta 5 stars)Not really a very good movie ... but I did like the idea behind it ... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with . The movie is ostensibly an "" episode "" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off "" danger zone "" and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them . The survivor , if there is one , wins fame and fortune ... everyone else just winds up dead . The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad . None of the "" real "" people seem real at all . The actors playing the killers are kind of fun ... because they are portraying cheesy and over - the - top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types ... and that 's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show . The movie pretends to be done all in one take ... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the "" danger zone "" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly ( to hide the "" cuts "" from one take to another , I would imagine ) ."	0
"The film is a collection of cliche 's on just about anything out there . It has no focus whatsoever , no goals , no real message . Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous . This movie ca n't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists . Every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy , unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal . Where there is no substance to this exchange , the actors ( regardless of how good they are normally ) ca n't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion , aka "" raising the stakes "" . Over acting , to put it simply . The directing is of no help here . Nothing can save this non - story . It is forced , faked and boring to tears . Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who , piercings and flashy 90 's outfits . Characters wander without a role , detail and motive . Locations are arbitrary . This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever , with meaning and art ripped out.Good DP . I 'll give it that.Some films have flaws . This film is Lee 's flaw . He sold out , like the rest of them . Became irrelevant . He has nothing of interest to say anymore.I have no desire to see anything again from this guy ( whom I 'll refrain from naming from now on ) ."	0
"I first saw this version of "" A Christmas Carol "" when it first appeared on television . I actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations . I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year . With the exception of "" It 's A Wonderful Life "" I consider this version of "" A Christmas Carol "" one of the best Christmas movies ever made . George C. Scott is excellent and a superb cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him ! Scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time . Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself . How can someone be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge ? Scott does so easily . The direction is marvelous with the fine sets , costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time , place and era depicted . You will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season ."	1
"( Rating : 21 by The Film Snob . ) ( See our blog What - To - See - Next for details on our rating system.)Here 's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on - screen tedium . < br />You'll not be wringing your hands , nor rolling your eyes , nor sighing into your popcorn . No indeed . For a movie of * this * averagousity , only clawing at your own face will do . < br />When you begin to claw your own face -- as begin you must ! -- start in at the lower portion . You 'll need your upper portion , with its handy tear ducts , intact for the Truly Tear - jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you have n't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then . < br />In a season celebrating Joe Six - Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy , permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create . * Watching * it , however , is a much more dangerous undertaking . < br />Here 's our story ... < br />Sidney Young , the London publisher of a fourth - tier celebrity / entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under . He needs a miracle , and what he gets is a phone call from New York City , in the USA.The publisher of Sharp 's magazine , Clayton Harding ( played by Jeff Bridges ) says "" Come work for me ! "" With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment / office in the background , saying "" Yes "" is a no - brainer.Soon Sidney is at work in New York City , doing allllllll the wrong things . His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are ( 1 ) Jewish , and ( 2 ) gay . < br />He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes , the industry 's hottest movie star , when she leaves it in the magazine 's offices during a business luncheon.This is a spot of bad luck for everyone , for , among other things , Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes , before he wakes up to the Dunst character.Worst of all , he totally alienates Alison Olsen ( played by winsome scripting - confusion by Kristen Dunst ) , a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine * and * The Big Apple . ( We have , of course , been to a movie before , and so we know how this relationship is going to end up . This is therefore why we 'll need intact tear ducts for the movie 's third act.)The problem with The Thing is , the script just never jells , excepting for the one tear - duct set piece in which True Love prevails.Publisher Harding is supposed to be a son - of - a - bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over . The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy , however , and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze.Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young , but whenever he comes up to her ( as he does constantly ) she makes a point of engaging him in conversation , instead of attempting to discourage his existence.The "" comedy "" of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room , and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception.The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is "" wounded . "" The character never shows us * why * he is wounded , however . This is yet another resultant of the movie 's mortally wounded script.At one hours and fifty minutes , This Thing feels longer ( and more deadly ) than Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow . It is uninspiring , unfunny , unredeemable , and not even rentable . Run Away"	0
Being a fan of silent films , I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time . I was pretty disappointed . < br />As has been mentioned , the film seems to be one long , long , commercial for the Maxwell automobile . < br />Perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is , I may have enjoyed the film more . But it got old very fast . And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films , without lessening a viewer 's enjoyment , what was with the Mexican bandits ? I mean , they are chasing a car through the mountains , a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour , yet they ca n't catch up to it ?	0
"I ca n't believe I actually sat through the whole thing . This movie has the worst acting since Killjoy.Here is a brief outline of the plot : The movie starts out with Jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach , drooling over a skinny blonde - haired beach "" hunk "" who looks like he has n't been to the gym a day in his life . Somehow , everyone knows him , and every single chick in the movie wants him . UH OH ! Here comes the competition ! The stereotypical "" hot chick "" and her best friends , who drive an ugly pink car . We soon find out Jojo 's mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia , which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind ( oh no , I think I 'm gon na cry ) . A huge storm comes , and fills their swimming pool with nasty water . Somehow , for no apparent reason , the little chick falls into the pool , and comes face to face with , yup , you guessed it , a MERMAID ! This is where the "" story "" really takes off . Basically , they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the "" hunk"".This is a preteen flick with acting so bad , it makes the 80 's look like the pinnacle of Oscar - worthy performances . This movie has all the clichés possible ... the best friends , the "" hunk "" who everyone wants , the "" hot "" bad girl and her bitchy friends , the scary old man ... you name it , it 's in there .

A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red . _ Undertow _ is pointless and unengaging , and made me think often of a phrase by Twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together . When someone brings up the category of Worst Films Ever Made , it 's not the likes of _ Plan 9 _ or _ Attack of the Killer Shrews _ that I think of ; it 's the likes of this . What a complete waste of time -- my own and everyone who was involved with this flick .	0
"Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED , many may assume that I 'm some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered "" classic "" horror . This is not the case , as I 'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life . But admittedly , I 'm a child of the 80 's that grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal , etc ... types of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster - paced . Just like someone who can appreciate different music , painting , or in this case , film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film ... I just don't ... THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls . The heavy - handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand ( or whip in some cases ... ) to keep the girls in line . She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower ( in their nightgowns no less ( ? ! ? ) ... ) , and meanwhile , girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who 's lurking about the campus ... I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA ( which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion ... ) , in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake . I 'm all for "" tension "" and "" suspense "" in horror films - but this film held neither for me . Luckily , I was n't expecting a whole lot going into this one , so I ca n't say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally do n't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70 's . This is n't a hard and fast rule , but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception . Probably a "" must - see "" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as I do n't really know too many fans of that sort of material , I ca n't really recommend this one ... 4/10"	0
I was really stunned how much a film , that 's over 60 years old could impress me . It is nearly two hours long , there are absolutely no stars in it , there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch . What impressed me mostly was the realism of the film . You could nearly feel the coldness of the ice , because you could see that the storms are real . This is a relief in a CGI - world like ourdays . I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke . I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it . Now who wants to talk about ' Titanic ' anymore ? It 's a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects .	1
Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie : Too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing ( that the screen is cut off ) , because there seems to be important actions going on , but you can not see them . There is anyway already too much confusion in the movie , so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals . < br />I like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work . I can handle deep and slow movies . But this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.Nothing to get attached to , to any of the characters , because they are not worked out well enough . To work out characters more is needed , than just minute long face shots , at least with this set of script+director+actors.I wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors . < br />I will stay away from films both written and directed by Le You for sure in the future . < br />What an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history , and for someone who spent time in Shanghai .	0
After seeing the 1996 remake , I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin . The whole movie was quite funny , and on my view , better than the animated one . But there was actually no need for a second one . First of all , if Cruela is returning , do n't cure her and make her insane again . Just make her break away from jail and that 's a rap . I thought it was not very funny . It 's supposed to have only one original puppy returning . I 'd expected that it should be Lucky , since he was the most appealing , and besides , having Roger and Anita back too . However , they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred , not even one hundred and two , but only THREE puppies , and a parrot that thinks he 's a dog ( clever ) . Gerard Depardieu 's part was pointless . At the end , Cruella suffers way too much , way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true . She gets baked inside a giant cake . That was a desperate attempt of physical humor , trying to imitate the same effect from the first one . That just did n't work . It was too much over the top , and not too funny . I actually felt sorry about Cruella .	0
"Across the great divide which we call understanding , there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders . In every instance , there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much . Conversely , there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the ' End Time . ' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason . When those responsible are arrested , they remain silent less they disturb the order of things . David Burton ( Richard Chamberlain ) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused . Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee ( David Gulpilil ) , Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice . The movie is fraught with puzzling , dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom . Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it 's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint - hearted , in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers . Good silent drama . * * * *"	1
"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother 's love , the exceptional performances , the steady execution and the quite innovative script . The film tells the story of an Indian woman , Nandini , who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja . All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India ( of whom she had not even known ) is in troubles and the couple rush to India . When they get into the village , Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture ; Shekhar 's family , ruled by his cruel , highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha , lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless . Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home , but he is soon killed by his father 's enemies . When she wants to leave , Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India . Here starts the intense struggle which can be called "" Nandini vs. Narasimha"".India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film , but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas , so it may be even correct . The portrayal is in my view fair and not one - sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent . Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world . The locations are amazing , the music is wonderful , and Krishna Vamshi 's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing . One thing that must be noted is the very ear - pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar , it is beautiful . The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film . Portrayed realistically throughout , the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch . Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written , and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points , a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The film 's biggest strength is the performances . Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini . Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible . She displays so much intensity , impulsiveness , anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son . Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child . After Fiza , this is her most powerful performance . One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen , Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha . He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him . Patekar displays cruelty , wittiness and even humanity with total conviction . He is outstanding . Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India 's most underrated actress , Deepti Naval , who sensitises her character to perfection . Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief . Anyway , do watch Shakti - it could have been better , but it is definitely a must - watch ."	1
"This was one of the DVD 's I recently bought in a set of six called "" Frenchfilm "" to brush up our French before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year . So far , as well as improving our French we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of French cinema.What a breath of fresh air to the stale , predictable , unimaginative , crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by Hollywood . What a good example for screenplay writers , actors , directors and cinematographers to follow . It was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures . < br />The other thing I liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end . Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex - con would display ? Will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her ? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.Once you have seen this film , like me you may want to see it again . I still have to work out the director 's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look . The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office . You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place . But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied . Four stars out of five for me ."	1
The world of the Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world . Planetoids , bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen . It is a world reminiscent of Neverending Story , when the Nothing came to eat the world away.Funny enough , the villain here is the World Gobbler , as well . This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes . The heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior , an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal . They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who , to my chagrin , did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death.The animation is great . The voices and the sounds are top notch . Too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine . They go to stop the World Gobbler , they reach him almost immediately , they defeat him . The end . No real character development or story twists . Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such a plot.Bottom line : it 's a cute thing to watch , kids would probably enjoy it , but that 's about it . No depth to this world ( pun intended ) .	1
A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle . They demand a huge ransom for her release . Peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl . Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack . They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for Laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter . The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that ( not going well so far ) . Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts . In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem . He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives . The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really.Now I 'm not a massive Jess Franco fan , in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen , but even I can tell that this really is n't one of his best efforts . The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening . The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show . There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out.Devil Hunter is poorly lit ( Infact I do n't think it was lit at all ) , badly dubbed , poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it did n't bore me . I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it . For example a scene where Laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting . Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed , hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes . Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him . It has to be seen to be believed . Then of course there is the actual devil . It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes , he has very blurry vision.The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80 's here in the UK and was banned . Now why it was I have no idea . There is very little gore at all and it 's hardly a shocking film . Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost . The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth.There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan . There is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise I would say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle . It would probably be more fun.3/10	0
"Just too many incidents of violence.The film goes from one scene to another , and in nearly every one violence erupts.Now I am not one who is shocked by violence , and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing . But , please , not one after another . My reaction was not shock or horror , it was : "" Here we go again . "" There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence , but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely , and could n't wait for the end.If this is the best the film makers can do , they should find something else to do with their miserable lives , like making shoes or delivering mail ."	0
"Like wearing a hair shirt . Positively , absolutely , without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever . Pure torture . Zero stars out of ten . One long , tedious , labored , pretentious , self - conscious , theatrical , and leadenly artsy scene after another . Intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic , the soul bared , it is , instead , morose mush . < br />Half - naked , father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers . "" Homo - erotic "" is the point , loud and clear . OK , so what ? < br />Repeated more than once by the son is the line , supposedly lifted from "" Lives of the Saints , "" "" A father 's love crucifies . A loving son lets himself be crucified . "" The parallel to god and his son , Christ , is heavy - handed , irrelevant , and bombastic , like everything else here . < br />Some reference points to the theme of Russian filiality : "" Mother and Son "" ( 1997 ) ; "" The Return "" ( Andrei Zvyagvatsev , 2003 ) ; "" Little Odessa "" ( James Gray,1994 ) ; Turgenev , "" Fathers and Sons "" ; and , of course , Dostoyevsky , "" The Brothers Karamazov . ""Credits in English indicate intended international distribution , meaning that the excuse can not be used that you have to be Russian to understand this mess . < br />This is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as Sokurov 's last , "" Russian Ark "" ( 2003).As in his "" Mother and Son , "" an equally powerful soporific , some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors , though not as interestingly . The film is almost monochromatic , shot from start to finish through beige filters , making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing . A soft - focus haze only adds to the drugged feeling.An annoying soundtrack drones on , never shuts up , like a tape loop . An old radio constantly plays in the background . Russian Romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "" themes based on Tchaikovsky . "" The presence of a "" sound designer "" ( Sergei Moshkov ) signifies , of course , that all those irritating little sounds , radio static , noises , distortion , and such , are "" designed . "" < br />It 's hard to believe someone ( Sergei Potepolov ) actually wrote this thing . It all seems as arbitrary as traffic , as if improvised by bored actors , popping out of nothingness into nothingness.Modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the thing without being the thing , so that what we behold is the idea of the idea , empty as a shell , but not even a shell , merely the idea of a shell . Could one ask for a better definition of decadence ?"	0
Yes i 'll say before i start commenting , this movie is incredibly underrated.Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass . He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star . Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.The acting was good ( apart from Thewlis)Stone really has a talent with this role . She 's slick , naughty and seductive and does n't look a day older than she did in the first . She really impressed me(like in Casino ) . Morrisey was also good . He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it . Thewlis however was lame . He ruined his character and was over - the - top the whole way . He really sucked.Overall , this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch . Just ignore Thewlis .	1
"Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work , is sent to aid an elderly semi - catatonic woman , Emma ( Grace Zabriskie ) , after her previous caretaker , Yoko ( Yoko Maki ) , disappears . Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma 's home , and she attempts to "" see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".Maybe it 's a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalan 's films , but slower - paced , understated horror films are a recent trend . In some cases , such as Hide and Seek ( 2005 ) , the approach works remarkably well , and in others , such as White Noise ( 2005 ) , the pacing tends to kill the film . I did n't like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek , but this is still a very good film -- it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend , however . One , it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju - On ( 2000 ) ( in particular , it 's extremely close to the first half of Ju - On : The Grudge , aka Ju - On 3 , from 2003 ) . Two , as with many Japanese horror films , the slower pacing here is n't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism . As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror , The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.Director Takashi Shimizu , also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju - On series to date ( the fifth is currently in production ) , and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story . The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes , with dream logic , where the focus is atmosphere , creepiness , the uncanny , and for many viewers -- scares . How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to , or are used to , this different approach to film - making ( although admittedly , some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju - On series ) . Traditionally , American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning "" rules "" for the "" monster "" . A more poetic , metaphorical , surreal approach to film is n't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S.However , even if you 're not used to it , it 's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot . This is a well written , well directed , well acted film , filled with unusual properties , such as the story interweaving a large number of "" main characters "" ( which is done better here than the more episodic Ju - On 3 ) , good cinematography , subtle production design touches ( check out Gellar 's clothes , which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma 's house , when Gellar first approaches ) , and beautifully effective horror material.Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past , the pacing usually enhances the eeriness , and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained . The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing , and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu , have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore . Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture , it 's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery / thriller territory with a "" here 's what really happened "" flashback , but even that was fairly well done , and otherwise , this would have been a 10 out of 10.Now that I 've said all of the above , let me finish with a mini - rant : It 's not that I 'm anti - remake , but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption . The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release . There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non - white or foreign actors . Yes , The Grudge is a fine film , but ultimately , I 'd rather see something original using this talent , and be treated to the latest foreign horror films -- not just Japanese , but also Indian , Spanish , Chinese , etc.--at my multiplex . In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this , it is also more cost - effective to do this , as ( 1 ) you can completely avoid production costs , and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit , and ( 2 ) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions ."	1
"From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb , this movie seems to get ragged on a lot , but I did n't think it was THAT bad . I 've seen much worse , actually.""The House Where Evil Dwells "" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife , Ted and Laura Fletcher , and their daughter , Amy , who move into an old house in Japan . Little do they know , a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover , and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword . As strange things happen in the house , the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living , and plan on re - enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance , from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story . It was routine , and it was corny , but I 've seen worse in my day . The ghost sequences were a little over - done , we get to see the translucent blue - tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family , and take over their bodies . To be honest , the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland . I may be mistaken , but after watching this , it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "" Ju - On : The Grudge "" and the American remake of that film ripped this off a little . The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place , ghostly activity , curses put on the home , etc . But I may be wrong.To sum it up , this is a pretty corny ghost story . Do n't go out of your way to see it , but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot . 4/10 ."	0
The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations . Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye . Jean Simmons is quite good , and Trevor Howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero .	1
Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this is a very different story and while Angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great Julie Andrews . Having said that Lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance . There is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by David Tomlinson . Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer . It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice . There are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again . Its also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles . The score has a couple of beautiful songs especially The briny sea and The age of Not Believing . The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality . The effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive . The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying . I loved the marching song of the home army . The home guard were very important to Britain and this is a warm tribute . The animation is delightful , much better than Pixar which I find grotesque . A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage .	1
This movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars . It tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to . Plus the bomb blast scene is very real.What you read and are taught just does not happen!!!Can raise your BP level by 10%All actors played their role very well.Some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers.This movie is quite adult in nature.Not a movie that can be seen with family.Casting is great ! ! !	1
Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940 's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones.Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young . After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides ' deaths , the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.You have got almost everything in this movie : the scientist 's assistants consist of an old hag , a hunchback and dwarf ( her sons ) , a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela 's house . Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look , especially for Bela Lugosi fans . Great fun.Rating : 3 stars out of 5 .	1
Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films . In terms of quality , they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash ; and unfortunately , Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter . The plot is just your average story of a witch , wizard or ( as is the case here ) warlock , who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it ... etc etc . We then get a séance and one thing leads to another , and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again . The plot is slow , painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless . The characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever . Paul Naschy wrote the script , and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme , and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is . Carlos Aured , who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides dull direction here , which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film . Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them ; but Horror Rises from the Tomb does n't even have that . This is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest .	0
From the director of movies ' Last Seduction ' and ' Kill me again ' , comes another movie in the noir style . John Dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery , blackmailing in the early 90s . Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction . But nowadays Mr Dahl has resorted to directing television shows . Its a shame since the man had talent.***SPOILERS * * This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Cage ) that comes in to the town of Wyoming for a job . However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit - man from Texas by bar owner J.T Walsh . He is given the task to kill his wife ( Boyle ) . But Cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it . On the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road , who he then takes back to the local hospital . At that point Cage coincidently meets Walsh again , who also appears to be the local sheriff . After that Cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit - man that happens to be Dennis Hopper.John Dahl has co - written and directed this movie . Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen . The direction is of good standard , however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling . There were too many close up frames . However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience . The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect . Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically , though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained . His facial expressions were on the mark . Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale . Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees . Hopper played his part well . But I feel he was miscast for this role . He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit - man . The role was not written keeping his personality in mind.While viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like ' The Hot Spot ' and ' A Perfect Murder ' . Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar . Overall if you are a fan of noir movies , then this one is for you . Worth recommending . 7/10	1
This is a great story of family loyalty which , thankfully , does n't resort to the usual tricks ( or at least the ones I 'm used to seeing in American and European films ) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension.It 's very watchable and very lovable . It has some beautiful cinematography , but does n't rely on that alone to entertain .	1
"I looked at this movie with my child eyes , and I was n't disappointed . The story is well - known , some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio ( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal ) ... And I do n't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut . This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.Briefly : it works , it is funny and it is a "" must - see "" with your children ( they 'll like it ) ."	1
"Whatever his name is ( the writer and director ) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again . This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time . Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they 're actually sort of good . Not this one . This was so bad I got angry . Seriously . A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script . What a waste . ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all , the CGI was barely acceptable , the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was , it 's like he just decided , "" I want this to happen and this to happen , but I do n't care how we got there , just shoot it and put it in . Whatever , I 'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose , if anyone calls for me , I 'm not here . "" Shame on you whatever your name is . Shame on you ."	0
"A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself . 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he wo n't turn out like his father .

I knew I was in trouble when , after a great opening scene , we jump to 20 years later -- ALL bad horror movies do that!The dialogue is atrocious , the acting is bad ( except for Betsy Palmer -- why Betsy ? ) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative .

* * * SPOILERS * * * < br />this movie always seems very exaggerated , until i remember that my college campus had a former - student - turned - Nazi - racist - killer - who - then - committed - suicide , too : his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith.look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him.it 's hard to believe , but this stuff really does happen.i'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube , but Larry Fishburne , Kristy Swanson , Jennifer Connelly & Mike Rappaport were good .	1
I do n't know much about the Rat Pack , and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self - consciously full of himself to me . So when I call this one of my all - time faves , it 's nothing to do with a tribute - band mentality . As another reviewer says , Mad Dog Time is about symbolism , not realism . It 's kafkaesque ( a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd , when he was so good as Josef K ) , it 's stylish , knowing , sardonic and slick . Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters , trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily , trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others do n't , whom he can outshoot and whom he ca n't . Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss ( his best performance ) have a ball , and the supporting cast look spot - on . The symbolism , the settings ( the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry ) , the dialogue ( style , not practicality , is the order of the day ) , it 's all about characters interacting , not really gangsterism . Fun to watch , must 've been fun to do . What the critics were up to is really a mystery ...	1
Silly movie is really , really funny . Yes , it 's got its dead moments , it can be a bit too obvious , it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess , but it 's laugh out loud funny all the way . And it 's worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing kook . This movie is in the same class as Elvira , Mistress of the Dark , another incredibly funny , underappreciated film .	1
You know the people in the movie are in for it when king - sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky . In fact , the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller , and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer . But he 's too much the European rationalist , I gather , to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams.Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director - writer Peter Weir . Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock ( 1975 ) . Here it 's the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites . Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason . Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man 's court . But the more he looks into things , the more mysterious things get , and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him . And then there 're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times.Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout . One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain 's wife and little daughters . Audiences can readily identify with them . And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework , the normalcy begins to buckle , and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide . Chamberlain underplays throughout , especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does . After all , it 's the picking up of the mask that holds the key ( I believe ) to the riddle , yet his reaction does n't really register the revelation . < br />Of course , the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now , thirty years later . In the film , the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus - pocus , but the subject itself remains a telling one . One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene . A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family , leaving them in the historical dust . The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells . Yet , it 's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave . Perhaps there 's something about past and future to think about here.Anyway , this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you .	1
An overlong , but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods . The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men , and how they help each other out , but the second half is n't as strong , due to the elimination of the Biko character . Still , its a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington , in the film that put the latter on the map . Washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time . Overall , a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit . 7/10 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _	1
WOW is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it . trust me watch it!i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny ! I ca nt believe they superimposed the school sign ! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time . If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies . even the costume was bad . it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it . heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well . all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first . its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done . hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out , just not like this one .	0
Well ... i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it , and i wish i had , I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day , and it made me yearn for more of the same , what i got was AIRPLANE on CRACK ... i mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles , then you 'll probably be in heaven , but if your used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY , then you will be dissapointed , there was alot more Eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy , which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out . I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder , and part one 5 times as much . Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2 , but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well .. maybe its just me . The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye . But that was nt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance . Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape , and then Rent it , do nt buy it .	0
I 'll be blunt and to the point . This film is not good at all . The film buff part of me hated the acting , script , story , direction and almost all of the editing . Amanda Peet has proven that she can act , as she was a high point of ' The Whole Nine Yards ' . So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole . However , the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny . If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is , and if you find smut jokes funny , then you should be all right . And for those of you who ca n't get off your pedestal , that s your choice . My inner child hasen't died , and I laughed a fair bit . Even then , only a 3 out of ten , because as a movie , it really does stink .	0
""" Secret Sunshine "" reminded me of "" The Rapture "" ( 1991 ) , with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny , but this Korean production is a better film . It portrays super - religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city , and the main character 's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy . Shin - ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ( ' Secret Sunshine ' in Chinese ) from Seoul with her young son . She has chosen Milyang because her late husband ( killed in an auto accident ) was born there , and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place . She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots , one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings . Shin - ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can . In fact , she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with , but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world , and the consequences are often hilarious . To say more would be to give the film away , but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role ( Jeon Do - yeon ) is stupendous . Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007 , I expected her to a decent job . But Ms. Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen . The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waugh - esquire piece of work , showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable ."	1
"One could wish that an idea as good as the "" invisible man "" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects , but this is not the case . The story , the characters and , finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad - scientist flick from the early 50 's . There are some great moments , mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets . But alas , soon we 're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab , which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable , but schematic.There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years , and some of them have their charms . But it 's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven ( who does have his moments ) is a very bad one . It is obvious that the money is the key issue here : the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough , and as a result , "" Hollow Man "" is seriously undermined with clichés , sappy characters , predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.However , the one thing that actually impressed me , beside the special effects , was the swearing . When making this kind of film , modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them . Therefore , the language ( and , sometimes , the violence and sex ) is very toned down . When the whole world blows up , the good guys go "" Oh darn ! "" and "" Oh my God "" . "" Hollow Man "" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them . I 'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears . I think we can thank Verhoeven for that ."	0
Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980 made - for - TV film attention . But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the Rev. Jim Jones , who built a church into a virtual empire , and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a Congressman and his entourage were assassinated , and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking Kool - Aid doused with cyanide.Done very tastefully but horrifying enough , unlike the excruciatingly sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED , GUYANA TRAGEDY features an all - star cast , including Ned Beatty ( as Rep. Leo Ryan ) , Meg Foster , Randy Quaid , Brad Dourif , Brenda Vaccaro , LeVar Burton , and Madge Sinclair . But it is Powers Boothe ( in his first big role ) that really stands out as Jim Jones . He actually BECOMES the man , and his performance is riveting and chilling . Thus , it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years .	1
"Black Candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us "" Vampyres "" and much later , "" Rest in Pieces "" , among others .. I'm only noting the ones I 've seen . At any rate , we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it , and the man keels over . Not sure if it was good for either of them , at that point . Fast forward to where the man 's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will , or something to that effect , and of course everybody else except her is in on something , which happens to be devil worship . It 's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times . To spice things up though , there 's a simulated bestiality scene ( I HOPE it 's simulated ) with a black goat , sure to be a crowd pleaser . Ugh . At times this echoes "" Rosemary 's Baby "" , minus the baby , because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too , because that keeps getting remarked upon . However , the herbs are n't the only thing that reeks about this film . The end seems to be back to the beginning again , and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they 've been during the middle part . It 's not unwatchable , it 's just not very good , and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films , and there was n't much here that did anything much for me . 3 out of 10 ."	0
Anyone who loves the Rheostatics ' music is going to enjoy this film . I have some minor complaints , mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors ( not Maury ) who are n't really convincing in their roles , but I do n't have time write a detailed review . I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented CBC television in Canada : The version that airs are the CBC is like the Reader 's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- don't watch it . It cuts out entire scenes and subplots ( if you can them that ) from the film . The CBC , which presents most of films untouched , took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC . I do n't know why . It 's horrible what they did to the film . Rent the video or watch it in a theatre , but DON'T watch it on CBC television .	1
"Opening scene ' explains ' why Hurt is later ' immune ' to the ' Contaminated Man ' . Too bad it does n't explain anything else : How did he get whatever he ' caught'/what was it / why does it work so fast . Then we go to "" Present Day Budapest "" . OK , was the opener in the past or the future ? It turns out to be the past , of course , but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning . Sorry , I should have paid closer attention , huh ? Or maybe it 's just badly done . Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he 's had in related fields , and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him . Aha ! So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects ? He must have been one of the top guys , he 's friends with the c e o of the Chemical company , for God sakes . Then there 's the substance itself : Technically a poison , but it mutates in immune ' carriers ' , so we can have whatever we want ; a poison , a disease , an allergic reaction , all very different things in real life . Magically , it 's not contagious from one dying victim to another , only from the carrier . How convenient . Then there 's the h a z m a t protocol : They jump into a situation without having any idea what 's in store , or how prepare for it . Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash - down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance ? I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique , and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all ."	0
"Damn , I 've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I still do n't get bored watching it.The visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind - blowing to me.The CGIs are quite bad IMHO , but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie . The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable , the plot is so good.However although , the movie had little flaws , like e.g. sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too "" slow "" , but I do n't mean the scenic parts by that , I totally loved those.Also I got distracted very often by the totally complex story , like when he is in the underground bunker - like thing of digicorps , where all their data is saved , and has this conversation with the guy down there ... but that may also just be me :D And the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized , they should have made the getting - back - true - memory - part a bit longer and "" louder "" but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again ..."	1
"This film really disappointed me . The acting is atrocious . Unbelievable . And it 's about actors . The story is incredibly obvious : A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and , in turn , they start to live out the lives of the characters they play . I 've been watching a lot of movies lately , thanks to Netflix , and this is the first one I have n't watched all the way through in a long time . I felt I did n't need to see the end ; we all know the end of this story.For some , it seems , this "" modernization "" of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening . I can not speak to any of this as I was n't raised in the Christian church . That being said , I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture . I 'm curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion , for better or worse . I have n't seen Mel Gibson 's version , but I 'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this , except for the most conservative . I just wish this was a better film.Lots of these reviews praise Arcand 's direction and especially the cinematography . I liked neither . The film itself is rather prudish and preachy . I did n't believe the characters ' personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives . The play within the play is very much dated and would not , I think , carry it 's own weight in a real time production . But that 's beside the point . What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about . And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.There were two examples of this that come easily to mind . Firstly , there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple : the lead actor , who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer , becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial ( with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience ) with her pants off . He trashes the place and chases them all out . I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach . The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high - school rendering of Death of a Salesman , i.e. , not well . Please stop hitting me over the head with this high - handed "" significance . "" The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who , eventually , turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays - corrupt Church . Why . Why does she sleep with this guy . "" It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain . "" Ah , the saintly whore and the lovable old coot . It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters . They are going through the motions and I 'm reaching for the eject button.Feel free to write me off as bored , jaded or just not interested . Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion , in all its beauty , sadness and inspiration , delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade . Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel . But do n't say I did n't warn you ."	0
"Too bad , I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey . But the director failed to put this together . There 's a lot of action , a lot of promise , but it all comes off hokey . The director did n't do his job . Promising action comes off lame . So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film . This version of "" The Rage "" ( DirecTV credits it as 1996 ) simply is n't worth the time to watch it . Another director would have done a better job ."	0
"I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body actually was n't as bad as I was expecting , my mom wanted to see it , so I rented it . I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes , but actually this was n't too bad . I was just expecting this horrific movie , but it seems like the writers meant no harm , but the casting of Eva Longoria(Parker , sorry ) , she seems a little off set for the movie . I think I may have found it to be a little better without her , just she does annoy me . But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable . But you have to admit , there was no point to this movie , it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing . The movie could 've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.Henry just lost his bride to be , Kate , who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day . But when his sister takes him to a psychic , Ashley , Henry falls for her , but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave . Kate is jealous and does n't want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley does n't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles , believe me , with Kate 's voice , that 's scary.Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie , not sure if it 's worth the money , but I 'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious . Eva Longoria just does n't have enough star power to make the film work , no offense to those who love her , she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen . Not to mention the character of Ashley , she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls , or her "" gay "" friend , Dan , just again , not really likable . Just with some re - writing and proper attention , this film could have been better , but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.4/10"	0
As usual , Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie . But , this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the Russian woman ! ! Well done . Even facial expressions were great ! Language was perfect ( even in Russian language ) and Nicole did a splendid job ! ! Hey guys - you get what you pay for : )	1
O my gosh ... Just give me a minute to breath . This movie takes you on an awesome ride and does n't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending . This is the the movie for fans of Stormriders and such . Legend of Zu was beautifully created , although I did n't like a few things , they used alot of stand ins . I wanted to see the real person fight but , oh well ... a few small let downs , and I did n't really like it a lot until I watched it again , when you understand it more it totally kicks A * * ! I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true Asian movie , to see this movie . I give this movie one of my highest ratings . Go and see it when it comes out in America ! ! !	1
Grey Gardens is a world unto itself . Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation , eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their ( apparently ) shared bedroom . Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter 's elocution . This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights , as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 % real.The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade ( other than that they were poor and clean ) . They would bicker all day , grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men , work , and self - expression.This film is a must - see for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship of this kind . It is sad and voyeuristic , but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly . It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context -- remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .	1
"THE FOURTH MAN ( Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve , that works best as a thriller . That 's quite surprising , considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.""The Fourth Man "" is top - heavy on symbolism . Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I 'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove . He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way , he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline , and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out . In "" The Fourth Man "" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity ( of which there 's plenty ) but , as in most of his films , he seems afraid the audience would n't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes . There 's hardly a scene without sex or full - frontal nudity , most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face , it undermines an otherwise good story . < br />Nevertheless , when you can cope with Verhoeven 's pretty obvious satiric approach , it 's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round , Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular.Camera Obscura --- 7/10"	1
The Invisible Maniac starts as a young Kevin Dornwinkle ( Kris Russell ) is caught by his strict mother ( Marilyn Adams ) watching a girl ( Tracy Walker ) strip through his telescope ... Cut to ' Twenty Years Later ' & Kevin Dornwinkle ( Noel Peters ) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a ' mollecular reconstruction ' serum . However during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails & they all laugh at him , Dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them & is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes . Jump forward ' Two Weeks Later ' & a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress Mrs. Cello ( Stephanie Blake as Stella Blalack ) says that she has hired a replacement , yes you 've guessed it it 's Dornwinkle . The student do n't take to him & treat him like dirt , however Dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum & uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges & his desire for revenge ... Co - written & directed by Adam Rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym Rif Coogan ( I would n't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either ) The Invisible Maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff . The script by Rifkin , sorry Coogan & Tony Markes is awful . It tries to be a teenage sex / comedy / horror hybrid that just fails in every department . For a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots , not much else I 'm afraid & the birds in The Invisible Maniac are n't even that good looking . The comedy is lame & every joke misses by the proverbial mile , this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having Henry ( Jason Logan ) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny . The Invisible Maniac makes the Police Academy ( 1984 - 1994 ) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication ! As for the horror aspect that too is lame . It 's also an incredibly slow ( it takes over half an hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible ) , dull , predictable , boring & has highly annoying & unlikable teenage character's.Director Rifkin or Coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try & make The Invisible Maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience . There 's no scares , tension or atmosphere & as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through . He does nothing with the invisibility angle , just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets . There is very little gore or violence , a bit of splashing blood , a few strangulations & the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun , unfortunately he was invisible at the time & we only get to see the headless torso afterwards.The budget must have been low , & I mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film . Dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet ! When he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him & the entire school has about a dozen pupils & two teachers . The Invisible Maniac is a poorly made film throughout it 's 85 minute duration , I spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion ... Lets just say the acting is of a low standard & leave it at that.The Invisible Maniac is crap , plain & simple . I found no redeeming features in it at all , there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish . Definitely one to avoid .	0
""" Cut "" is a film about some film students making a film . It 's very much in the "" Scream "" mold , an ironic , self - referential horror flick which , for me at least , falls down because for all its irony , it 's still just a bad horror film , same as the films its referring to.But it was not without its charms . Well , one charm anyway . Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt , bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew . She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it was n't an act , although everyone involved with "" Cut "" says she was lovely to work with . : -)Seriously , every scene of her pouting , sulking or snapping was great . Everyone else , however , wavered between being OK and being terribly wooden.Anyway , "" Cut "" has some laughs , a few buckets of gore ( some of it surprisingly gruesome ) , and ultimately is .. just another bad horror film ."	0
Water Lilies is a well - made first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship . Sciamma works with specialized , slightly sanitized material that is as off - putting to some as it is alluring to others . The film focuses exclusively on three middle - class teenage girls in a tidy new Paris suburb . Their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.Such distractions as parents , siblings , work and school have been neatly excised from the equation . The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie ( Pauline Acquart ) , who is not on the team , but thinks she would like to be . Marie worships Floriane ( Adèle Haenel ) , an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after . This takes Marie away from her former best friend , also a member of the water ballet team , the somewhat plump Anne ( Louise Blachère ) . Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys . Floriane , like this film , promises a bit more then she truly offers . Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl : she suffers inwardly . Flroiane does n't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.Marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as Floriane . Floriane takes advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations , then , lacking any other friends , her confidante . All the other girls think Floriane a slut , an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases , because it leads them on . She suffers the pretty girl 's fate of being not a person but an object , and she ca n't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her , but she does n't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap . Enlisting Marie to act as her pal so her ( unseen ) mother wo n't know she 's going out to meet boys , she also gets Marie to rescue her from the boys later . It looked the opposite at first , but Floriane needs Marie as much as Marie thinks she needs her . Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that 's earthier and more real than the other girls'.Keeping all external context at bay , Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls ' goals and interactions . On the other hand the film 's water madness , which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots , makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly . Luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever - present goals and avoidances and just do silly , pointless girl things . It 's the offbeat moments that give the film life ; too bad in a way that there are n't more of them . But Sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics . Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls , who understandably love to gaze at themselves . < br />There 's no great revelation or drama on the way , but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that Marie does n't just admire but truly desires Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends -- whom Floriane always stops before they go all the way . In a typical irony of this kind of plot , Floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with Marie -- but Marie is the one who holds off , because she knows it wo n't have the significance to Floriane that it will have to her . When it happens , it 's a timid , mechanical affair . Meanwhile Anne has a huge crush on Francois ( Warren Jacquin ) , a male swimmer , but of course he is after Floriane . Boys are not an element that 's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor , but they are just bodies and faces , available studs .	1
STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br />Ray ( Ray Winstone ) has a criminal past , has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie ( Kathy Burke ) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat . Meanwhile , her mother Janet ( Laila Morse ) is aware of Ray 's son , Billy ( Charlie Creed - Miles ) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails . The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable , and that would include watching films that entertain them this way . Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this . It 's a tale of a broken family , torn apart by crime , poverty , booze and drugs , the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal . It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men , three generations apart and each copying the other , tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together , despite not being strong enough . If you pick up a little of what it 's about from the off - set , you can see it does n't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly does n't disappoint in this.It 's true what everyone said about the performances , and the lead stars , Winstone and Burke , do deliver some great acting . We see Winstone lose it with his wife , beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia , breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid . Likewise , in a private moment , we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase , the full impact of the night before kicking in.This is another of those films where there 's no ' plot ' to follow , as such , just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next . It 's been acclaimed by many ( including the Baftas ! ) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me . I have no right to criticize it for this , knowing what I knew about it from the off - set , but sadly this is how I found it . * *	0
"What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults ? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film.Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria , Egypt . Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker ( and blatant lesbian ) who services daddy on the side . Daddy gets sent back to the site , where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it . Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade , and falls for a hunky Egyptian ( providing the film 's hottest scenes ) . Eventually , Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going . Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison , talking to a portrait of what looks like Genie.Robert Englund is terrific as both the Marquis and his descendant . His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements , so he is allowed to shine here . His best performance is still in "" Killer Tongue , "" if you have not seen that yet.The rest of the cast , including young Genie , are pretty and average . The script , however , is problematic . You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary , except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set . The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever . Who the mermaid is is never explained , and its link to Christianity ( which is hyped throughout the film ) is nothing . The film is very anti - Christian , as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father , but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute . There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence , but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say . I know I have no idea.So why am I recommending this film ? It is weird . There is an extended sex scene . For the ladies , hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude . Englund is marvelous . Do you like snakes ? This film is full of them . This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget . Knowing Hooper somehow came up with "" Crocodile "" after this is rather sad . "" Night Terrors "" is not perfect , but definitely worth a winking , unserious look.This is rated ( R ) for physical violence , some sexual violence , gore , profanity , female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , sexual references , and drug abuse.<br / >"	1
"This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin.The plot is absolutely bizarre . I fail to see any "" sensual "" or "" erotic "" undertones . The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography . In addition , the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong , such as the airport in the middle of the city , poor living conditions and noise pollution . Throughout the whole film , I keep thinking that "" The Pillow Book "" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment.""The Pillow Book "" is a perverted , yet boring film . Seriously stay away from it ."	0
Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float . Sure they used various actors for Batman , but in that instance Batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape . In this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas ... Somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original ... If I had not known it was a sequel I would n't have guessed it from the cast ... except of course Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better ... In the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better . They should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel . This one is just a cheap imitation . The Ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die .	0
"There are movies , and there are films . Movies are more often than not merely cinematic "" candy , "" whereas films are true works of art . Fraulein Doktor is certainly well - placed in the latter . As most viewers , I was highly impressed with the battle scenes , but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what I consider to be the most sterling quality of the film . Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland , all the while in the throes of morphine addiction , die Fraulein is treated very shabbily by the German high command despite all of her efforts . The scene in which the Doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a Mercedes Benz command auto , alone , desolate , and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a "" spy 's "" lot in life . Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the Spy Who Came in from the Cold comes close . Fraulein Doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing . I only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can , and those who have seen it can again ( perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture ."	1
"I have n't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . I do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of Braveheart . It is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . Also the Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him , he looks like a Scot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy . It 's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to Mel Gibson as William Wallace . Gibson is supposedly playing a man who 's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter . The story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an underdog story . Sound anything like Braveheart ? But instead of a film that cries out "" freedom "" , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . This makes it a more interesting film . Much like Gladiator . The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . The scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do . Overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . Go and see it !"	1
"I 'm starting to think that there 's a conspiracy , all right : one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film , despite its obscurity , will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a "" universal acclaim "" or something within that range , thus ensuring unsuspecting folk ( like me ) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing , expecting a surprise , only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck.This movie is one of them . It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because it 's rather clear that two things might have happened : either I did n't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film 's inner realms as to be impossible to access , or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name . 4 is a dirty trick on the audience . It 's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say "" smorsgabord "" and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic , no one had heard of it . It 's terrible with sugar on top.Firstly , there is the ever - present number four from start to finish . While having a little symbolism here and there is okay , and it 's been done with various degrees of success in many well - known movies , this movie is panting with it . Four dogs at the start of the movie , looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly , machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt . Four people in a bar , although one of them is a non - entity . Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless , not only to each other but to what their lives are not . While this concept may work , the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would - be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre , and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation . Or maybe , like I said before , I just "" did n't get it . "" The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marina 's story ( which revolves on the death of her sister , from bread - chewing , no less , and the subsequent , shrill mourning which follows ) that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace . So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own ? The director does n't invest much time in truly tying them together , or weaving a tighter story that could , in a David Lynchian way , intersect either with the past - present , or within alternate dimensions , or even as a straightforward , mundane science - fiction story . This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint ( or someone into the weird for weird 's sake ) could endure ."	0
This is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village , that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old Kurosawa 's works , combined with Dostoyevski 's topics of human psychology ( O - shin - Sonia Marmeladova ) , Shakespeare 's drama and Hans Christian Andersen 's tragic and cheerfulness . The screenplay is wondrous , the scenes are colour- and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind . The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action , so if you do n't like all the sentiments you 'd also come to your costs - . It is not about mysterious Geishas and proud Samurai with their Bushido pouring all out of them , but about life , work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time . A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa , certainly worth seeing .	1
It 's remarkable that for ' Young Mr. Lincoln 's ' supporting players Ford cast lesser known , other - than - star actors . This not only heightens his film 's focus on the central character of Lincoln , but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time , a man embroiled , as each one of us inexorably is , in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them . It 's not so much through Fonda 's Lincoln 's words and actions but in the faces , the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln 's worldview , sense of place in society and polity , and of how the people responded to Mr. Lincoln 's words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.Give this a try : instead of focusing on Henry Fonda , next time you view ' Young Mr. Lincoln ' shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will , I expect , be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford . I like to suspect that Ford 's storytelling through the supporting characters ' reactions to Fonda 's Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in ' Doctor Zhivago ' , in which it 's the supporting characters ' reactions to Zhivago that actually tell about Zhivago .	1
"This was the first movie I ever saw Ashley Judd in and the first film of Victor Nunez ' that I ever say , and boy am I glad I did . Its ' quiet tone , its ' relaxed pace , its ' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life , its ' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life , the decisions she makes based on real things , the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie . It is as close to movie magic as I have ever seen outside of the "" Star Wars "" movies , and , given what those films are like , that means this film deserves a high rating indeed . Ashley Judds ' acting , Mr. Nunez'writing , and its ' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming - of - age story and a wonderful movie ."	1
Typical thriller , has been done many times before . Simple plot outline ; cop Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell 's wife , and he tries to bump off good ol' Kurt so he can have her . This is beyond predictable , it does n't even try to make you guess , the plot is the plot and there 's no thinking outside the box here . I guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops , but nothing is done originally or interestingly . There 's not really anything to say about this film , it 's not particularly bad , but there 's no good points either . Russell plays Russell and you know what you 're gon na get when you see him in a film . Ditto Liotta . Stowe has an annoying Cher - esque voice . I read the plot outline and I could see the film in my head , it was so obvious and basic . I watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as I had imagined . I felt not a drop of emotion throughout . I have no feeling towards this film , it 's as if I never even watched it . Considering this , it 's a pretty pointless film is n't it ? Still , I 'll give it 3/10 for some reason .	0
A confused mess from start to finish . Like they used to say about the Beatles'songs , there was a secret message if you played the LP backward . If one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start , you 'd come away with the same degree of disappointment.Apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts , the clearest characters were the movie backers , out for revenge if the movie did n't get sorted . There was nothing to like about these two either . Overacting , shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion . I think one dimensional was an overstatement.Okay , so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them , we plebeians just did n't get it . Well I 'm afraid there was nothing to get . And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish . A non - existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that , and by far the worst , not a single character you cared about in the least .	0
"Swayze does n't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain . Compared to Stewart Granger ; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "" Scaramouche "" , the 1952 "" Prisoner of Zenda "" and the 1950 "" King Solomon 's Mines "" ; Patrick Swayze fails utterly . Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "" League of Extraordinary Gentlemen "" was very good in an otherwise big flop . Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady , and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his ( shoes ) ! ! ! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain 's 1985 version , I now highly recommend it if you ca n't get your hand on the granger version ."	0
The Ladies Man is a funny movie . There 's not much thought behind it , but what do you expect from an SNL movie ? It 's actually better than most SNL movies ( i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury ) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny . Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene ( one of the funnier ones in the movie ) . Other than that , the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows . I 've definitely seen funnier movies , but I 've seen dumber ones too . Again , it 's not exactly a deep movie , but it 's good for a few laughs . It was funnier as a skit though . But still , if you 're looking for a pretty funny movie , I 'd recommend this one . Just do n't think about it too much , or you 'll hate it.Rating : 6/10	0
"Semana Santa is jaw - droppingly bad . It 's so wrong in so many ways I do n't where to begin . So , let 's see ... Mira Sorvino , whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her , goes from Madrid to Seville for her cop job . During the holy week ( Semana santa , see? ... everybody begins to fall sleep .. told u it was bad in so many points , even from the beginning ) , a killer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena . She teams up with male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and nice Feodor Atkine . Soon she discovers she 'll be the next target of the killer ( who wears a red robe ) . Why , oh but why?Why .. ;that 's the questionthat has been in my head the whole movie.Q : Why did go to see that A : Because i love Mira Sorvino ( i even excuse her for that AT FIRST SIGHT crap)Q : Why were we only 8 people in the theater this saturday on the first week end of release ? A : ah - ah - ah . Spider - man got relaesed the same day . But also the fact that the movie has been blast with execrable reviews.Q : Why this movie has been made ? A : Money I guess . But boy did Mira need the money.then ... why ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? first of all , there 's always something wrong with european co - productions . here you got a french - english - german - italian - spanish - danish production . yi - ha.Then it wants to play on the same playgroung as US thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever . Even VALENTINE , though unnecessary and badly scripted and shot , was much better in the suspense and the fun.Then , to give some credit to the story , the screenwriter wanted to add some political sight to the story . Wrong : done in flash - backs in a Traffic - like photography , it 's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie . Could have stick to it , it would n't have to sit through the whole movie . Better go straight to Guillermo del Tros 's THE DEVIL 'S BACKBONE ( El espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.Then the homophobia . Bullseye ! The first victims are S&M drug addicted gay twins who got stabbed to death . The annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved overweight transvestive with a blond platinum wig . Calls mira Sorvino 's character a big dyke all the time . Do we need this kind of stuff ? Nah . Just needless offensive remarks , just like ol'times.Then the suspense . Yipee . No apparent motive . The first murders are plain illusion as they 're a representation of a famous painting . But no . And the revelation of the killer ( a horrible fascist , of course ) could have been done from the beginning as he appears at the end of the movie as , I guess , it was time for the director to say "" weel , time to finish that damn movie . let 's reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills"".Then the director thinks he 's a director . Wrong : no sense of suspense , no sense of directing the actors , no knowledge of change of pace . A Giant , mega - bore . The scenes of the holy week are needless ( maybe a co - production rule saying : ok , shoot in Sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of Easter . There we are : a mystery movie for tourists!)Then the actors . All wrongs . Mira Sorvino bores herself to death : she does practicly nothing except getting stabbed in the right hand . Everything she did best ( the Replacement Killers , Mighty Aphrodite ... ) were like they never existed . Olivier Martinez ... hello , anybody here ? When the producers will learn that he 's not an actor but a mannequin with no ability of speech nor feelings ? Feodor Atkine , bland and transparent . Only do we pay great respect to Alida Valli , one of the greatest actress this last century ( and I hope for some more roles in this current one ) . She 's tha main attraction here as she 's the only one to give life to her poor lines . I wo n't mention the other actors as they 're only one - sided characters , uninteresting and shallow.Incoherent direction , inconsistent actors , implausible plot . Idiocy incarnated.Superwonderscope says : 1 < br /><br / >"	0
I saw the film for the first time at BBC on July the 27 of 2005 . For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle , and I truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it . I also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned . You may ask yourself was A.C. Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question . However he was the creator of the famous Holmes , but how much of it was a sort of semi - biography ? Not the less I strongly put this adaption forward , it is a movie you have to see - even if you are n't interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look a it , enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it .	1
Our imp of the perverse did good his first time out , that s for sure . The music is the best you may ever hear by any human , but you already know that , unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness . A poor script that does n't flesh out much of a story , but at least it has its moments . the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it . He deserved an Oscar for this s**t , even though he was at times an ego driven twit , with his towering bodyguard Chick Huntsbery always in front . A movie that made non - fans fans , Take it or leave it . Prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though . He takes himself way to serious . He is a genius musician , but pleaseee .. Just enjoy the ride , my purple maestro .. Peace .	1
Shallow , shallow script ... stilted acting ... the shadows of boom mikes lingering over the actors ' heads in scenes ... worth watching because Kate Mulgrew plays the most selfish mother in TV movie history and it 's all before Ben Affleck got his teeth capped .	0

"The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion ! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which "" Moonstruck "" possesses , spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood . Let me describe the circumstances to this film , simply put , they are "" yesteryear "" . "" Moonstruck "" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City . New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker - some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers , this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well ! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes . Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made . These generalizing proclivities still exist today , however , they are more mollified and less identifiable ! For this Italian family of a bygone era , confusion , indecisiveness , agitation , and yes , of course , love , all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them ! The kindred spirits with everyone in "" Moonstruck "" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties . One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role , as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie . In "" Moonstruck "" , however , I think she was incredibly well suited to her role , and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation . All of the characters in "" Moonstruck "" are very rough around the edges , really tough , and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity . The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection , and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose ! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational . All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else 's basic nature is really like ! ! For this family , nothing is glamorous , nothing is pretentiously romantic , and nothing is overly emotional ( just moderately so ) . The fact is , this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives . Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one 's resolve , masqueraded mystique , and resistance to the proverbial am ore ' . Thus signifying everything ! ! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest , get angry ; Be honest , get confrontational ; Be honest , get distorted and emphatic ; Most importantly ; Be honest , and fall in love ! ! This is Cher 's best performance ever as an actress ! ! Nicholas Cage , Danny Aiello , and Olympia Dukakis , were wonderfully flawed in "" Moonstruck "" Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie ! Director , Norman Jewison ( Famous for "" Cincinnati Kid "" , "" Thomas Crowne Affair "" , and most famous for "" In The Heat Of The Night "" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967 ) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film ! I am Italian American in descent , ( Partially anyways ) Cher is not Italian , and , for that matter , neither is the writer nor the director ! I guess since non - Italians like eating our food , they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too ! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending ! ! For those of you who did n't like this movie , I just have one thing to say "" Snap Out Of It ! ! "" This movie "" Moonstruck "" is totally happy go lucky ! ! Totally eighties ! ! and Totally five stars ! ! See it ! !"	1
Peaceful rancher Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors , that is until notorious outlaw Robert Preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field . Soon he begins to go too far , feeding a growing sense of unease in Sterling , especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal.The Sundowners is a tightly - paced , gritty , and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by Preston . Here , he comes across as an evil version of Shane , that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw 's relationship is revealed . Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills , Jack Elam , and the debut of John Drew Barrymore , who became more famous for his offspring than his acting .	1
This movie kinda let me down . It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches . They both said no way its summer ! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one . But he really does n't do anything too interesting or exciting . I 'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gon na solve this case . They just say lets do police work and we 'll solve it . And what s up with all the old men with pool cues . I did n't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses . And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer . With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus . Come on what cruddy lines . I thought he was gon na hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies . I got this movie used and would n't buy it new . I suggest you skip this movie . Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee .	0
But I got over it . To me , it seemed that even the Author of the book favored Caroline . I felt so sorry for the character Louise , and she was constantly compared with Esau who was evil , I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un - realistic . Really though , the movie was bad . I would n't really see it unless you 're ready for a big let down .	0
Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it . I find it the most annoying program on TV . There is nothing funny about any of the ' jokes ' and the canned laughter is unbearable . The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience . That way the laughter would show just how ' unfunny ' the show is . However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast . It sickens me however to think that they 'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was . The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters . Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me . That is all .	0
The setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of Dickens ' classic tale . George C. Scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast . His Scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie . Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant . The 19th Century English town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film . It is a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real Grinch and It 's A Wonderful Life .	1
"Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad "" documentary , "" I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative . That said , after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it , one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands . < br />One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and , unlike the musical , offers no cautionary clues or explanations , only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight . < br />This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version ( hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable ) all the more remarkable . Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely , setting the sad inmates ' plight to music , raises the human tragedy to art . Even more important , this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness , and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about . In short , everything which the FILM is lacking.To the filmmakers ' credit ( or their successors ) , the excellent Criterion DVD release includes out - takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs , interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression . They ca n't make the amateurish film itself satisfying , but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible . < br />Ultimately though , it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright , composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single ( generous ) star ."	0
What i like about you is one of those series you need to see but are n't sure you would see , the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun , the second part i season 2 - 3 which are more stale , they come and go in what you want . what happens with many series is that they do n't end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain , this one also somewhat did , the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series , usually , but it does n't , this ending is perfect for the series , it fits perfect , actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in Val 's life , actually i wanted to end with Jeff in the end , but later on it changed , they chose to take Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him , and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top.see it many times the series is actually very cool just do n't expect the second part to be that good it is n't but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing , i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place , when i have seen the whole series i will be back ...	1
Okay , so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out . That is actually not the case ! It 's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it 's up to her mother to believe if she 's telling the truth or not.To be honest , I really enjoyed the concept of this movie . They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter . I did not however , enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan 's acting . In reality , this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else , perhaps a better actress . The character of Rachel ( Lohan ) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film.I do however , think that if you put Lindsay aside , you will enjoy this film . The ending is pretty great ( and sad ) .	0
"I have n't seen all of Jess Franco 's movies , I have seen 5 , I think , and there are more than 180 of them . So maybe it 's a bit early to say so but "" Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden "" ( better known as ' Succubus ' , but that is the cut version ) is according to me if not the best , certainly on of Franco 's best . Franco is best known ( although ' known ' might be slightly exaggerated ) for "" Vampiros Lesbos "" , a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90 's when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer . Through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of ' The lion and the cucumber ' ( ' Vampyros Lesbos OST ' ) : Jess Franco is an overwhelming director . When the phone rang during ' Vampiros ' , I let it ring . I just wanted to see more of the movie . Since that moment Franco never could grip me that much . But then I stumbled on this movie . It is even better than "" Vampiros Lesbos "" , I think . Franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera . We find out he can do a lot . I certainly did n't expect to find "" Necronomicon "" that great : its beginning did n't impress me at all . Remember , I had seen "" Vampiros Lesbos "" before ( although chronologically that came only three years later ) and both movies kinda start the same . But then the story went on , puzzling and gripping , beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see Godard do if he were n't so occupied with spreading his political messages . Later on in the movie I heard a dialogue about which art was or was n't old - fashioned . The man says that all movies have to be old - fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed . But the girl replies that "" Bunuel , Fritz Lang and Godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow "" . Janine Reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course Howard Vernon , a Franco regular , is also there . Luckily the acting is good ( something that can spoil a lot of Franco movies for you , but not this one ) . But certainly watch out for the dummy scene . The erotic tension , the wild directing and the fact that it 's a yesterday 's movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see . The fact that it is a bit more accessible than "" Vampiros Lesbos "" certainly helps ."	1
"In the colonies we 're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey , so I nearly skipped this film ( which had its TCM preview recently ) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "" Ghost Train "" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying . Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly . The physical aspects of Askey 's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you 'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby . There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre . One can feel , moreover , the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later ; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here . As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you 've seen , the more likely you 'll guess at the ending , but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance ."	1
Director Fred Schepisi(Roxanne ) directs this well intentioned , but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein(Matthau ) trying to hook his scientific niece(Ryan ) up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950 's . To get Ryan to like Robbins , Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist . The idea is cute , but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue . Tim Robbins , Meg Ryan , and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat , but are unable to rescue the film . Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie . I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan .	0
"What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days ... This was something with a budget , but it just was n't as much fun . John Astin of Adams Family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic , but he is supported by lame actors , cheap special effects and unfunny gags.The plot . Dr. Gangrene ( Astin ) escapes from a French prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of France ... The hero , his French girlfriend and the Gizmo - like "" Fuzzy Tomato "" decide they are going to stop him ... Forgettable Direct to Video nonsense ..."	0
Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she 's ever seen ... Since I thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking - which film was the worst film I had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind.Unfortunately it was a couple of years since I 've seen it but I remember the horribly miscast Dean Cain as cocky military man ( pretty boy Cain does n't do cocky very well ) . The strange deal with the CGI - helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some CGI - guys to make it , but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer 's son liked to play with his new computer . And how did it look ? ? Awful . And when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over - looks VERY cheap.Avoid this movie - it is truly awful ...	0
As an Army veteran , I was deeply offended by this film . In my opinion , it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war . To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement . If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon ( it was ) , it would have been better received . But it was taken seriously my many people , especially overseas . Silly as it sounds , wherever I went in Europe in the late 80 's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film . Unrealistic ? Hmm , let 's see . A monosyllabic , muscle - bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW 's . In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats . And he never misses , running with a 32 lb gun held up with one arm . I could go on , but I 'm getting a headache . I gave this a 2/10 only because it 's slightly better than Rambo III .	0
"This is where the term "" classic film "" comes from . This is a wonderful story of a woman 's bravery , courage and extreme loyalty . Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband , who through the years learned to appreciate her . ( Yeah right , A PEARL ! ! ) < br />Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role ( and what a waste of an oscar ) in "" The Great Zigfield "" . It really did n't show what , if any , talent she had other than her exotic beauty . But in "" Good Earth "" she shows that she can really act ! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either . People say that she did n't show any real emotions in this film . Like hell . Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman , with inner strength . She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions . Example : those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot . If you people are saying that she does n't act well in this film , you are NOT looking!Paul Muni shows that he can act as well . His character is not a likeable one to me . He never sees her for what she is , until the very end of the story . A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother , with her own special beauty . The greatest one of all , the beauty from within , like a pearl.If you get a chance to see this film , watch it . You will see one of the best films that the golden age of Hollywood created ."	1
First , let 's get it out of the way . . . yeah , this film steals a LOT from ' Darkness Falls ' ( 2003 ) . The plot for ' Darkness Falls ' goes something like this : The Tooth Fairy , a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge . In ' The Tooth Fairy ' ( 2006 ) , the disfigured Tooth Fairy ( who , yeah , hides her face ) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone . A little too similar to be coincidence.But , what must be asked is this : If you 're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie , why choose something as mediocre as ' Darkness Falls ' ? Sure it made a few bucks at the box office , but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered . A low - budget , straight - to - video movie will not have that same effect . And it didn't.As I watched the opening 15 - 20 minutes of the film , my expectations actually rose . There seemed to be at least SOME production value . The story did n't seem terrible , just blatantly ripped off . Past the first scene , we get an okay cast of characters including an ex - doctor with secrets ( played by that guy who looks like a Busey ) and some hot veterinary student ( Jenifer from Argento 's ' Masters of Horror : Jenifer ' ) . After those few minutes , however , the film just slowly goes down the drain . It serves all the basic horrible clichés including , but not limited to : some crazy old person with an unheeded warning , the buff dumb jock , the psychic , and the stripper with the heart - of - gold.One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience . It 's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time . When the adults were on screen , it had a more mature feel . When Star ( the stripper ) and whatshisface ( the jock ) were on screen , the dialogue went down to a more stupid , err immature , level . When the kid was on screen , it felt like an episode of ' Are You Afraid of the Dark ? ' . . . only less scary.Technically , the film is all over the place . The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring . The writing is subpar , as is the acting for the most part . On the plus side , there 's some excessive gore at parts ( including a fairly cool ( yet painfully predictable ) ) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene . Also , if you 're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff , there 's a brief topless scene ( but if you want to see this chick topless , there are better films to do that ) . Other than that , there 's not much to bother with when it comes to this film.If you 're a huge fan of ' Darkness Falls ' ( do those exist ? ) , maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way . . . but , that 's about the only reason I can find to see this one.Final Verdict : 3/10 -AP3-	0
If you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated , you 'll enjoy D - war . If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films , you 'll enjoy D - war . Otherwise , do n't bother ! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends . They really loved it and that made me feel good . After the movie was over , all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater.The CG is good . Acting and directing are horrible . Storyline is extremely simple . But , since the half of the audience was kids , they were screaming , shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen . This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been.It 's a good movie to take your kids to , but except for the final battle sequence , D - War is disappointing . I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much .	1
"Originally called The Changer . The Nostril Picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named Joe Bukowski ( Carl Zschering ) who "" likes em young "" . Unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special Vietnamese chant . This "" chant "" involves whistling ' London Bridge is Falling Down ' whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer . Nonetheless , Ugly Joe tries it out and hey presto ! He is now a girl . Ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls . But lets not talk about ideals here - this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 , in an ideal world it should have NEVER been released.The Film Asylum dubbed this horror hokum as "" mind numbing , ham handed story telling "" . Its worse than that . The Nostril Picker really takes the biscuit , in fact the whole god - damn cookie jar . Terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain - dead actors , a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist . Just when things could n't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent . For instance , Joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself . But i thought he wanted to get close to them ? Not content with being a murderer Joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims , of which there were only around 3 - 4.The highlight of this terrible movie involves Joe picking up a hooker ( Steven Andrews ) then taking "" her "" back to his apartment . What happens next defies belief ... Joe turns back into a man , but also discovers the hooker is a man . How does he react ? Well , in a Benny Hill - esquire fashion , he chases "" her "" around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo 's only to trip up on a blow up doll . God knows what Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking of . At least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment . This involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2-bit joke shop ' cop ' uniform . The hilarious acting is a must see . Especially the hooker 's inability at saying "" dildo "" and his demand for "" satisfaction"".Apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore . You know a movie 's bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting . Normally , i 'd fast forward to the good bits , only there were n't any here . The main action sequences involved Joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly . Forget quick cuts , Matthews utilizes fadeouts ( one during a stab scene ) to limit any form of suspense there might already be . One girl 's non - reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable . Normally i 'd relish the words "" uncut "" but in this case they were far from a blessing . Just more agonizing cinematic torture . The whole movie felt like an unedited episode of Midsummer Murders , only less entertaining . I 'd hate to see the cut version.To sum up , The Nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i 've seen since Richard Hammond 's 5 O ' Clock Show . Dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing . Do n't be fooled by the box label , this is NOT a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets - use - shitty - horror - dvds - for - coffee - coasters cult . Which i think it does . Unless re - edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess ."	0
This film is an entertaining , fun and quality film . The film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book , and tries to stick to the exact lines . The actors are all suitable , and you would expect them to be the part . They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film . The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts , and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film . There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard , for example . The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book , and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book . All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book , but are not in the film . Overall , a great film for a rainy afternoon	1
I recently saw this movie in my International Business class . I was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary ( not to say I do n't love documentary I 've just hard bad luck with movies in that class ) Imagine my surprise when this movie , that 's actually a movie , came up . < br />This film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere . The culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call . I would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh , because yes it is funny . < br />Well , that 's about it ! Cheers	1
"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions , made by obvious newcomers , but it does n't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films . It has a definite story , it has adequate acting , the photography is very good , the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men , and the background music is n't overdone . This is a DVD New Release , so people will be looking here to see if it 's worthwhile . I do n't know where all the 10 's come from , as there 's no way this film is that good --- even if you 're the filmmaker 's mother . < br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner 's trashing of J K Rawlings much - loved and excellent book , Order of the Phoenix . In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX , consider that PHOENIX ( as made by Warners ) had no story , certainly no acting was allowed by the director , the photography was dreadful , and the wall - of - sound overbearing musical score was just a mess . I rated Phoenix a "" 1 "" because the scale does n't go any lower . THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.If you have the opportunity , give THE DECOY a chance . Remember , this is n't "" Decoy 3 -- the Shootout "" or any such nonsense . It 's original . If your expectations are n't overblown by the foolish "" 10 "" scores here , you might just enjoy the film on its own terms ."	0
"This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay ( Ulee 's Gold ) . Nice and straightforward writing , that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award , looking at Ruby 's day to day life . What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby . Ashley Judd ( Sisters ) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role . Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity . She explores jobs , friendships , boy friends , sex , a typical young adult search . The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival . As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance . I appreciate this type of movie , because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage.Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody 's Fool , staring Paul Newman . The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man . I like that . The story is very nicely told , and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story . The only thing I am not sure about is the title . I am sure that there are not that many bugs , and flies in paradise as there are in Florida . As I am allergic to mosquitos , Florida is no paradise to me , I itch all over thinking about Florida . I turn into a complete red boil . I recommend this movie ! Favorite scenes : Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges , played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City , Florida . Indeed the sand is very white . I have been there . Favorite Quotes : "" Necessity has always been a good excuse . "" "" All that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now , who is going to be and when and why . ""<br / >"	1

Great home theater test disc ."	1
"If you 're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about , then you 're in for quite the surprise . Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline , but the actual film is anything but.As the synopsis went , it tells of an obsessed mountain climber , which you 'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl , which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis , an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind ( note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights ) , where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence . They can see our world , and notice of all persons this mountain climber , and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy , creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.What that translated to , is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce . Have shapes created , though credit goes to the stop motion style , and put it through a mind - numbing loop . And repeat until your eyes start to close , then move on to the next scene . If anything , the Chonopolisians ( if this term exists ) really love their sticks and balls , constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere , and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the "" other "" world . It gets no better as well , when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what 's advertised , which is 57 minutes ( or less ) against the 70 stated . While firmly dated , its dull colours , non - existent story , scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans . Do n't waste time ."	0
"This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have < br />have ever encountered in an American film .

Well - when the cameo appearance of Jason Miller ( looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV ) is the high point of a picture , what 've you got?It 's a little bit country , a little bit rock n ' roll : mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog - dried mummy ( have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in a bog ? ) in the basement , Christopher Walken with a bad dye job , and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they 'd developed her.I understand - sort of - that they 're going back to visit her relatives . After that .... Problem : There are several interesting flashbacks to what I must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing ( I think ) . This is never connected to anything . < br />Problem : What do we need the grandmother for ? Now , the grandmother could be interesting . She speaks Gaelic , or Celtic , or something . Maybe you can make something of her . The best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit . That 's all.Problem : They cast a real shifty character as the husband . Is he type - cast ( will he sell his wife to the devil ? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type ( after all , he has a good haircut and nice clothes ) ? He drinks , he hesitates . He 's not a bad guy . Not a good one . But dislikable . Why did n't they DO something with him?No problem : an old boyfriend shows up . The husband knocks him down . He comes back to knock down the husband . ( It gets pretty stupid , but at least THAT character has motivation . ) < br />NOW - she 's an alcoholic , he 's an alcoholic ; he might only have married her for her money . The grandmother is locked in the bedroom . The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch ( are you following this ? ) who may come to life . In fact , you KNOW she 'll come to life , the music swells . A little girl lives in the house , takes tea to the grandmother ( unlocks the door to do so ) and provides granny with cigarettes . Periodically , granny gets out . But nothing happens . < br />Husband and wife lose the kid in the house , subsequently lose their bedroom . Uncle gets his throat cut in the basement . The leading lady has nose - bleeds . The husband drinks . They both drink . In the face of all of this , the awful truth alluded to in the first over - voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.In spite of all these dangling - thread ingredients , nobody managed to get a story on the screen . No bridge between situations , no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror , just long slow scenes that go nowhere.;nbody , really , to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks , the grandmother who might be locked up because she 's a monster , but no , her worst fault is smoking . She 's got great hair , good makeup . < br />In short , no plot . Just a little random ( predictable)violence in a dark library , with the rain gushing in , and the sound track cuing us in . You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie.The production values were good . Oh . Nice scenery , good wardrobe . The cameraman , at least , knew what he was doing.I bought it . Poor me .	0
"Gregory Peck 's brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities . Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War ( and possibly ever ) MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions . He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace , yet he obviously glories in war ; he consistently denies any political ambitions , yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate ; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter , yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States ; he shows great respect for other cultures ( particularly in the Philippines and Japan ) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country . All these things are held in balance throughout this movie , and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man , although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country , and especially the Army he devoted his life to.Peck 's performance was , as I said , brilliant - to the point , actually , of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film ( which is perhaps appropriate , given who he was portraying ! ) with the possible exception of Ed Flanders . I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur : sarcastic ( repeatedly referring to MacArthur as "" His Majesty , "" ) angry , frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply wo n't respect his authority as President . Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArhur 's wife Jean , devoted to her husband ( whom she herself referred to as "" General , "" although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one . ) I very much enjoyed this movie , although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur 's early life . I have always chuckled at MacArthur 's reaction to Eisenhower being elected President ( "" He 'll make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had "" - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be , especially to his military commanders during wartime . ) Well worth watching . 8/10"	1
"I am glad to see most other people here do n't think much of this movie , either . It has some big names in the cast , but that 's it . There is nothing else to recommend , save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films.The story involves nothing but unlikable , self - centered , chain - smoking , "" hip "" characters that national film critics all seem to like .... and most of the public ca n't stand . < br />The Oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable , the southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing ."	0
"Extremely disappointing film based on the James Michener novel.What was even worse was Marlon Brando 's performance . His southern drawl was ridiculous . I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost . Brando , so great in previous films , was reduced here to a laughing stock . Tyrone Power , in "" Witness for the Prosecution , "" should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.The film , dealing with racism , dealt with the U.S. government 's attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.Brando was stone - faced throughout the movie . His moving from anti - these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman . His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances . Nothing about either performance was equally impressive . Umeki 's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part . A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka , who did nicely as Brando 's love interest . She showed great emotion as the anti - American who found love with the Brando character . Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11 . She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "" The Ten Commandments "" to the bigoted mother of Brando 's love interest at first . Her performance together with the one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted . Patricia Owens , as Brando 's first love , showed depth and conviction in her performance ."	0
"OK , it 's very rare that I complain something I got for FREE . So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit . I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and walked away very very disappointed . One audience member 's question to the director about using the Native American references just as "" bookends "" instead of being weaved into the movie better , basically says everything that this movie FAILED on . < br />NATIVE American REFERENCES--- The Native American references felt really out of place and contrived . It 's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before . They should have stuck to the old adage of "" write about something you know "" . IF they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice . < br />Clichés and ON THE NOSE--- I agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie . So I held it to higher expectations . "" Little Miss Sunshine "" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular . Before it even came out to wide release I was already raving how it 's going to be a hit . UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about "" Expiration Date "" . "" Sunshine "" took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a "" cliche "" . This movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start . The psycho mom 's antics , the Hendrix couple , etc . < br />I hate to say it , but the best and WORST movie I 've seen this year were both indies . "" Little Miss Sunshine "" being the best and this movie being the worst . I wish I could say otherwise . < br />But I do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery ."	0
"This has to be one of the worst movies of all time . The graphics were horrendous , the acting was b - movie and the effects were just plain Nintendo 64 qualified . You would think that they would put a little more effort into it . Of course , it is a Scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate , but this one takes the cake . Hell , I 'm still laughing . So , as a shake - your - head in disbelief movie , this one does well . < br />Although it appears to have some ' known ' actors and actresses in this , it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort . < br />The graphics might have been good in the ' 60 's or even early ' 70 's but come on , this is 2009 ! I wo nt give spoilers out , let 's just say that if you have played "" Jurassic Park "" on the Nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film < br />It is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing"	0
"Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater , Chuck Traynor . I do n't understand how having sex with a dog ( which is animal abuse , as well ) can be found to be entertaining or funny . Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films . I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women . This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings . We call ourselves "" civilized "" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized ."	0
It really is a shame that films like this never snag Best Picture nominations , because this one is simply a winner . This is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy I have ever seen . Its screenplay and design are impeccable , not to mention the incredible cast . I can quote this movie for hours on end . Watch it .	1
Was it foreshadowing when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot , and then her new boyfriend ( the murderer ) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence ? I think so . Scenes to make you squeal with delight : montages galore , a strip - tease in a kimono ( what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on , instead of take them off ? ) , and a climactic battle on skis ! Definitely tune in for the beginning and end , but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening . Is it better than CO - ED CALL GIRL ? Nah . Does Tori ever make it to paradise , or out of the snow , even ? Nope .	0
"This show is not clever . That 's basically what it boils down to . The "" original humor "" that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny . In another comment , someone quotes a couple hilarious lines . The standout for me was George H.W. Bush telling the kids they 're not supposed to watch any TV besides Fox News . Wow . I thought the episodes I saw were bad . The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season . I 'm a liberal republican and I know Bush has n't been a good president . We all do . But that 's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time . I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind ' Meet the Spartans ' . Their formula , bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.Again , just plain bad . Unfunny , and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed , but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons . Please do n't watch this crap , unless you 're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb is comedic gold . < br />Oh , and the voice of Bush sucks . All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent , and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences . At least South Park admits the voices are n't accurate . If you want funny political satire , watch Daily Show / Colbert . Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken , which is fun to watch , since the stop motion action figure animation is EXTREMELY well done . Look for the George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube . Priceless"	0
"I 'm sure to people watching this move outside of Britian this film will be an entertaining watch , but for someone from the UK it 's painful in it 's errors.Right at the start of the film Elijah Wood gets off a tube at Bank station , which has been trashed . He says to his sister , who he 's meeting , "" What happened here "" and she replies "" Oh Tottenham were in town yesterday "" ! ! ! Tottenham are in town already .. they 're part of the town , they do n't have to go there ! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they 'd do it is Bank station , where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.There are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan . He clearly decided it was n't worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mock - ney which made my ears bleed . It was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you 'd expect West Ham fans to speak . This error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film ."	0
Witty and disgusting . Brash and intelligent . BASEketball redefines comedy / sports with a pot spoof of an easy target . Makes other so called comedies like dead boring . One of the best of all time ! Trey Parker and Matt Stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection .	1
I saw this film prior to joining the British Army . I went through my basic training , at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier . My time was spent during the height of the troubles in NI and the cold war . There was times when I questioned myself on what I had gotten myself into , not for long , as the training would always take over and you would always react instinctively . The voice over used to display what the soldiers are thinking is spot on , though I would have added breathing and heart rate as this seems to pound in your ear drums in given situations . Some years later I was in Canada for a family get together . An Aunty of mine who lives in the USA and is a lecturer at the Columbus Uni Ohio had done a paper on the effects of the British Army in NI . She spent some time out there researching . Although an ex pat she was very anti - British . She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier . My only answer was see the film ' A long day 's dying ' . It 's the closest a civilian will get to realise why a soldier does what he does . The answer is right at the end .	1
"Disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in New Mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons . The town of Weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes . The Henleys watch a Blair - Witch - Project - esquire video diary left by the town 's last victim , which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie . Although Hamlin and Dey 's performances are much better than the supporting casts ' , their emotional affect seems "" flat "" to me throughout the movie . < br />Disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction . However , the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense . Worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie , which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable . It appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes , that they threw away all the elements of good story making : plot development , gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution / outcome . < br />The most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three - quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we did n't deserve an explanation : < br />What was the significance of the Indian symbols on the walls ? What happened to the original people of Weaver ? What was the connection with the people at the dinner ? What did the Sheriff know ? What did the missing boy discover if anything?This was , I believe , a bad move , since it engendered some resentment . I had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events , only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things . These are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week , but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand - alone movie ."	0
The worst thing about Crush is not that it 's acted pretty bad , or that the plot is virtually non - existent , and it 's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.No , the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.But in the end , it 's too little , too late . If you are a fan of violin - music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40 + women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means , do n't miss it.I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie , and as a result I had a pretty horrible time . The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.The verdict : 4/10 . Guilty of wasting my time.<br / >	0
"The film transported everyone back to October 20 , 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great Philippine ' I Shall Return ' landing scene   It was on that Leyte shore where General MacArthur reaped his fame   < br />Above all , Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general   It is the stride , the set of the shoulders , the intensity   It 's what both men have had in common : intensity , total absorption , devotion   With MacArthur it was for the military   With Peck it was for the challenge of acting   An Academy Award winner for "" To Kill a Mockinbird "" , an Oscar nominee for "" Keys to the Kingdom "" , "" The Yearling "" , "" Gentleman 's Agreement "" , and "" Twelve O'Clock High""he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist ; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney ; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower   He has brought to them all his own unique insight , his character , his sincerity , warmth and love , and especially , his humor   < br />There is a scene where ' MacArthur ' stands on deck with the ' President of the Philippines .

"I first saw this movie 3 years ago , and it was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and the real Jim Morris.About a month ago , it came back on TV , and this time I taped it . Since then I must 've watched it at least three times.This is a wonderful , inspirational , feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned . It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book , as well as all of the other clichés.It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids are n't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues , and the jocks are n't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I.In my opinion , Hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term "" gritty realism "" , making movies where everyone curses , and has problems with aggression.This movie is about a man who has a dream , and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream . The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there.As I said b4 , the film does n't try to go overboard with sentimentality . Dennis Quaid , as usual , never disappoints . I 've watched him from the late 70 's , and he is so underrated.But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE concerned , and kudos to the writers.A gem in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game , and his wife calls out to him from the stands . He rushes over and reaches out to his family . The look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless.If you 're looking for a change of pace , then pick this movie up ."	1
I have seen the freebird movie and think its great ! its laid back fun , about time the British film industry came through with something entertaining ! ! its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents , nice touch . The acting was convincing ( i am a biker ) they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene . It was good to see the film director getting in on the acting , well done jon ! At the end a new crop gets mentioned , in Ireland is this the foundation for a 2nd film ? hope so keep them coming . Great film , well written , realistic characters !	1
"Oh my ... bad clothing , worse synth music and the worst : David Hasselhoff . The 80 's are back with vengeance in Witchery , an American - Italian co - production , helmed by infamous Joe ' D'Amato on the production side and short - careered director ( thank heavens for small miracles ) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi 's Evil Dead series in Italy ( that was dubbed "" La Casa "" in there ) , Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.A mix of ghost story , possessions and witchcraft , the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix - ups slow it 's progress to expectable ending , topped with some serious WTF surprise climax . ( I just love the look on her face ... ) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes ; unluckily for him , these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.The plus sides are experienced , when the gore hits the fan . This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80 's Italo - gore , when things were made 100 % hand - made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow . I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over - the - top ways that obnoxious characters ( and actors ) got mangled and misused , one by one . I only felt sorry for Linda Blair , who apparently have n't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career , or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.Well , folks - not much more to tell , and even less to tell home about . Do n't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this , and probably you 'll experience at least some mild fun . It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80 's euro gore horror . And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors , MUST have it 's one on the right place.This is my truth - what is yours ?"	0
They filmed this movie out on long Island , where I grew up . My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie . Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer , ( which they told me was colored water , tasted disgusting , and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again , especially in the funnel scenes ) . Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form . It never came out in the theaters ( obviously ) and it , as far as I knew , was never released on video , and I 'm sure was n't released on DVD . Yet it looks like it was seen by some people , albeit it probably very few . So there must be something . I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother , yet there is no way I can find it anywhere . Does anybody know anything about when / where / how this movie could be purchased ? And which format that would be ?	1
I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist 's body , infected with a stolen chemical , is recovered by the US military , the corpse is then cremated , releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island . Soon the infected locals turn into flesh - hungry zombies , and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead . I did not find this film to be as good as the original film , Zombie Flesh Eaters . But it was still an OK horror film with some good action . I did not think that it was one of the best in the series . 4/10	0
Liongate has yet to prove itself . Every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal . i 've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again . And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception.I could n't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad.here 's the plot . Guy cuts up dead dog for some reason . Gets infected by random virus , transfers it to kids at a camp , kids start to get infected and die , town finds out about it and rather than help them , kills them . then the water is infected and everyone dies . the end.Seriously , that 's the whole movie.all the characters are completely retarded , you do n't care for any of them , and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world . Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie . We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls$@t , because this film will make you do that.and i 'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish . And again , why did this dog attack the girl ? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him ? that was part of the two of their 's plan ? wow . best plan ever . i can not believe this movie got a theatrical release . i could barely stomach the DVD , let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half . It was n't scary , or funny , or cool , or anything . it 's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to ... i do n't know , plant a tree or something . it 's more productive than this piece of garbage . The acting , special effects , and script are a joke . do n't ever pick this up.Cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene , out of 10	0
"The ' 80 's were not very kind to one - time major star Charles Bronson . Starting with 1982 's "" Death Wish II "" and ending with this truly gruesome film from ' 89 , Bronson 's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness . "" D.W. II "" left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson 's character 's daughter , ( a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail ) . "" 10 to Midnight "" was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards . Nothing redeeming about it . Other films like "" The Evil that Men Do "" and the remaining "" Death Wish "" films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge . I 'm not sure if the producers ( usually Pancho Kohner ) got a kick out of showing a weary looking , senior citizen - aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what , but the shoddy craftsmanship ( and terrible scripts ) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated.""Kinjite "" -- the last of these films -- is fairly well - made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness . In this film Bronson : sodomizes a perverse john ; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch ; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner ; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I 've thankfully forgotten . Also depicted is the gang - rape of a young Japanese girl ( fortunately , this was off - screen , though well - implied).What were people thinking when they made this film ? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films ? For anyone interested in his best movies , check out most of the films he made in the ' 60 's and ' 70 's like "" The Mechanic "" , "" Death Wish "" , "" From Noon til 3 "" , "" Once Upon a Time in the West "" , "" Red Sun "" , "" The Great Escape "" , "" The Magnificent Seven "" , "" Rider on the Rain "" , etc . , etc ...."	0
When viewing a movie as silly as ' Hot Rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one 's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy . With a brief runtime of 88 minutes , this film was long past drawn - out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and were n't even funny in the first place . ' Hot Rod ' 's base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 's cult hit ' Napoleon Dynamite , ' though it 's much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter . In fact , the movie 's blatant desperation to be compared to ' Napoleon Dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed.The movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , poses a paltry story that puts self - proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses ( one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped , so we 're told by Rod ) and raising $ 50,000 dollars for his stepfather 's impending life - saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect   because in order to gain one 's respect , one must first fight them . Huh ? Whatever . Each character is no more interesting than Rod 's stick - on mustache , and from the film 's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , SNL skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minutes , is , essentially , what ' Hot Rod ' strives to be.The film 's star , Andy Samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip - drop of his comedic capabilities . Unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five - year - old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee - pee gags . And if that 's disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hands , and brace yourself for the real blow : he IS the film 's humor ! To rescue them of their mortification , I 'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg 's co - stars ' roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team , director Akiva Schaffer , to his non - existent talent as a director   or a comedian . Basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash - course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , as though the film would be funnier that way . Trick yourself into believing that there 's even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie .	0
Though not in the whole film , Andy Griffith again plays his role best in this CBS tv - movie . The plot is easy - Griffith 's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named ( Mountains Somewhere ) . Though it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video , if you do get the chance to watch this -- TAKE IT .	1
Personally , I think Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made . It touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy . And Brando should have won for best actor . Anyway , the movie is awesome , the man is attractive to BOTH MEN AND WOMEN and now you have no reason not to see it ! Do so , and fall in love .	1
"I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles ( e.g. Good Will Hunting , The Fisher King , The World According to Garp ) . These are my favorite Robin Williams movies . But Seize the Day , although well - acted , is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie ( even worse than Death to Smoochy , Club Paradise , and Alladin on Ice).Every good story is going to have its ups and downs . This movie , however , is one giant down . I do n't need a feel - good Hollywood cheese - fest , but I 've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness . This movie reminds me of "" Love Liza "" ( which is actually worse ) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall . The answer ? Who cares ."	0
"You can call this one a flop , and that 's a very big one too ! Quality is n't associated with the words National Lampoon , but at least the Vacation and Animal House entries were fun , but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that I 've watched . Ugh ! The three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clichés and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood genre films , which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross.""Growing Yourself . "" - Jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do . That 's life , as Jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children , but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one.Talk about leaden , boring and stiff . There only real interest is the small performance of the lovely Diane Lane . The satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it . The silly humour is strained , flat and particularly senseless . Peter Riegert 's keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel bubbles along in her role.""Success Wanters "" - After just finishing collage Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the Dairy Company Presidents . For payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the ' very "" top.Probably the best one of the three , but the competition was n't too great . The gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone , but still they do feel more tacky and forced . The idea had something promising and inventive to build on , but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue do n't do it any favours at all . The humour tries , but more often does n't come off , despite the hunger . The seductively Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout ( well after the painful ordeal ) and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit . Even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story . Popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from Dick Millar , Mary Woronov , Olympia Dukakis , Fred Willard , Robert Culp and a favourite turn by Joe Spinell.""Municipalians "" - A serial killer who leaves copies of his driver 's licence behind after each murder , is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner . However the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go , when the pair encounter one situation after another.Stupid ! Oh yeah . Sure if you 're going to spoof something extremely over - the - top , make sure laughter will stream off it . Obviously they forgot that ! Even at its 30 minutes running , boy does it drag ! Robby Benson 's gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied Richard Widmark doing very little as his partner . Christopher Lloyd underplays the role of serial killer , but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads . Elisha Cook Jr. , Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear . When the jokes come , they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clichés.In all , the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable , and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless . Only one or two few gags make it out each segment , but really there 's too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head . This is because it virtually becomes what it 's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story . It loses sight . The performances range from hot to cold , but who ca n't deny the embarrassment that 's felt on most of their faces . Director Bob Giraldi 's first taste is a vapid one for "" Growing Yourself "" , but "" Success Wanters "" showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness . Henry Jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on "" Municipalians "" . Rick Meyerowitz 's vividly crass drawings that opens the film , are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood.This low - brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it , with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos . But really , is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get - up , just to spot them . Well , that 's up to you ."	0
"I was young film student in 1979 when the Union of the Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky 's "" Siberiade "" ; Tarkosvky 's "" Stalker "" and Danelia'a "" Autumn marathon "" . I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form . Then and only then , I saw "" Siberiade "" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless . Way better then Bertolucci 's "" 1900 "" . By far!Hope Andron will somehow get to the negative and make "" director 's restored version full lenght "" someday ! On DVD of course ! Also I fiercely fought in defense of this Cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating Soviet film with bad taste ! Time is on my side ."	1
I love this movie . My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film . We had no idea what it was going to be about , but it turned out spectacular . 2 thumbs up . I liked how the film was shot , and the actors were very funny . If you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie . I would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so I wo n't . This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies . Do you really think Nothing is bouncy ?	1
Sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment . Most DeMille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip . The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments . The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin ; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war - painted natives . This is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured . Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne . The whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish . Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here .	1
"The only reason that this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options . With a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup , horrific acting , and special effects that look like they came out of the "" Thunderbirds "" TV series , it is amazing that Widmark did n't kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume . Even by 1950 's standards , the special effects are atrocious , except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences . I can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because , except for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THEM ! , there was n't anybody else doing effects . It was certainly no contest for Disney that year if this was their only competition . I would n't recommend the film , even for hard core submarine movie buffs , as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up - raised periscope . There are other , much better , sub films that you can enjoy from this era , like the aforementioned 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run ."	0
"Ever since the cinema - loving universe made acquaintance with a guy named George A. Romero , the word "" zombie "" automatically gets associated with blood - soaked horror images and non - stop acting sequences . It 's safe to say that his "" Night of the Living Dead "" formed the zombie movie as we know it now . Yet , in the earliest years of cinema , the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow , nearly action - less psychological thrillers . Jacques Tourneur 's "" I walked with a Zombie "" is a perfect example and so is "" White Zombie "" , starring Bela Lugosi . This "" Revolt of the Zombies "" could have been another example but unfortunately it 's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies I ever saw . Dreadful acting , a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension ! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love - story intrigues and unexciting monologues . The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots . The lead actress ( Dorothy Stone , textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose ) irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her . Unlucky again  . If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes , you 'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale . Still , this is far too little to give this film a positive rating , let alone a recommendation . Avoid ! This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else ."	0
Well OK , I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I must say , I actually think this movie is good . This movie caught a buzz as the bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3 , much like Final Stab was to Scream 4 , and well this movie is n't that bad . I mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick , this movie is not half bad . It has some scares , and some really hot women I might add . Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence 's new beefy look though obviously even that has n't won him any big Hollywood roles either ...... I feel bad for the man , he had such a career in the early and mid 90 's with blossom , some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene , but then like in a 360 degree turn , his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.The movie also throws you off guard in , it makes you think between the crew , there really is a secret that someone knows , to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret . It also throws you off on who the killer is , I had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was , but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown . Now , had there been a secret that was let out ? This movie could 've been one of the better b rated movies . But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie.A so - so slasher flick . Good for a midnight movie .	0
""" I went to the movies , to see ' Beat Street ' / it was n't bad , it was kinda ' neat / ' Krush Groove ' was a flick , that I did n't mind / but when it came to ' Rappin ' , I drew the line . "" Word to your mother.Want me to stop?That 's just a small sample of the stupa - fly style of rhymin ' on display in this waste of film and location permits . This movie is seriously wack ( that s 80s - speak for just f*cking awful ) . As an emcee , Mario Van Peebles is one hell of an actor . And as an actor , Mario Van Peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder.Any film calling itself "" Rappin ' "" had better deliver at that genre 's highest standard of the time . So why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles , even back in the day when standards were so knee - high - to-""Webster""-low ? Because this rap is weak . So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold - rope chain.Blondie 's "" Rapture "" is def poetry next to this bit of Dr. Suess in the hood . So do n't be a boobie , avoid this movie!<br / >"	0
Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake ( Norman Bartold ) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean ( John Carradine ) , upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Dean 's four children , Gregory ( Jeff Morrow ) & his wife Laura ( Merry Anders ) , Victoria ( Faith Domergue ) , Johnny ( Richard Davalos ) plus Leslie ( Brooke Mills ) & her fella Carl Isenberg ( John Smith ) . Drake plays a tape recording of they 're late Father 's wishes after his death , the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children , if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga ( Ivy Bethune ) , Igor ( Buck Kartalian ) & the more mundanely named Frank ( John Russell ) would pocket the lot . Well , not satisfied with a quarter share of $ 136 million ( which is still almost $ 35 million back in 1971 which does n't sound too bad to me ) someone decides they want it all for themselves & it 's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge ... Co - written , produced & directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts . For starters this film 's alternate & much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in ' 78 which I 've always wanted to see , both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film & even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it & I heard John Carradine 's voice & I then knew it was n't the Milligan film that I had wanted to see , my heart sank . Then , of course , there 's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times . The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow , boring & extremely predictable . The character 's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way , the freak of a servant who ask 's his sister ( ? ) to cane him , the strange set of Brother 's & Sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then there 's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes . It 's boring to watch , it 's poorly paced & it 's just a chore to even think about it . Please , someone save me as this is really bad stuff . I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is , I really could.Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he should n't have even been directing traffic . The entire film looks ugly , it 's poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares . The blood & gore is tame , there 's an axe in a head , a decapitated head , a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp 's & the best murder when someone 's face is eaten by piranha . However there are question marks over this scene , so there 's the victim , right . There 's the tank of piranha , right . Victims head is placed in piranha tank , right . Pirahna eat victims face , right . Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten , erm where 's the blood?Technically Blood Legacy is terrible , it looks awful , the sound was obviously shot live & it 's muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise . The acting was not going to win anyone any awards that 's for sure , the least said about it the better.Blood Legacy is an awful film , there really is n't a single positive aspect to it or if there is I ca n't think of it . Do yourself a favour & do n't bother with this one , there are much better films out there .	0
"I watched this last night with low expectations . The reasons being , I do n't usually like "" made for TV "" movies and rarely have I liked "" cast reunion "" movies . But , the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like this , so I gave it a chance . I 'm glad I did . It was pretty good . Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves . But , in a way , they were acting as their "" Batman and Robin "" selves . They were being campy and not taking themselves , or this movie too seriously . The movie starts out with them searching for the "" George Barris "" designed Batmobile , that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan 's home . While , they are searching for the car , they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together . This is told in flashback . It was well done . The actors that they got , for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead on . And , for a TV movie , it got down to the nitty - gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen . I give this one a 9/10 , I liked it that much ."	1
"The story and the show were good , but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies . Ri'Chard is great .

I ca n't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar . He 's one of my favorite actors . I love Anne Rice . I 'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles , but I 'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book . This is a little too""real "" for me .

"Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative / revisionist history , and you get "" Aztec Rex . "" Apparently Hernand Cortes , before conquering the Aztec empire , had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate . That 's the thrust of this movie . Given the plot it could have really sucked ; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers . There are a few problems . For starters , Cortes is played by Ian Ziering . Even with a black wig , Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi . And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico , the Aztecs here seem to be played by an all - Hawaiian ensemble . Casting aside , the T - Rex(es ) look reasonably good , though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI . And they die too easily ; I suppose if a T - Rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary , 16th - century weaponry . But it takes something away from the movie . There are also some graphic T - Rex - swallowing - human scenes , which is surprising , but in this context I thought they worked OK . There 's plenty of action , and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does n't overwhelm the dinosaur angle , unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie "" Warbirds . "" Overall , a mediocre ( but decent by SciFi Original standards ) movie that rates a modest 4 ."	0
"Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius . She 's perfect . Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor . We 've never seen her before so it really feels like her story . She also brings across genuine toughness . This works against her though , because we never doubt her . You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we do n't think she can beat . So as a boxing movie , it fails.Then again , this is n't really a boxing movie . How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that is n't a boxing movie ? You do n't . But Karyn Kusama has anyway . Like many indie films , "" Girlfight "" defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.Diana is doing poorly in school . She beats up people she does n't like ( all the other girls in her school for example ) . She does n't fit in . Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough . He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing , as if she has no need to defend herself , nor anything worthwhile to make of her life . Tiny wants to go to art school ( cliche ' , yuck ) , so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana , who actually wants to box . Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer , Adrian ( Santiago Douglas ) , who 's looking to turn pro . From there the story winds down toward the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting . It 's all just a bit too believable . Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports . A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances . The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing , where anger is your friend . So this time it 's a girl . Big deal.Or there 's another position to take : finally , a boxing movie about a girl . Women 's boxing has been around a long time . The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people 's their lives and their feelings . The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture . Respect . Overcoming adversity . Self - discovery.I recommend "" Girlfight "" because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director . The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality , but the story itself actually changed my view on some things . Yes , the world now seems like a better place . A film did that.Grade : B-"	1
"Twenty five years ago , I showed this film in some children 's classes in Entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids ; they were spellbound ! It is not just about the termites who have built and live in the "" Castles of Clay , "" but also about the other animals who use the mounds . There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch . It is a not only good for entomology classes , but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds . < br />I wish it was available on DVD , so that I could watch it again and show others ."	1
"I think I should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts . The true test is whether it is good from start to finish , which is the reason I gave the analogical title for this review . Most of us would agree -- even those like me , who enjoy reading many blogs -- that blogs ca n't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons . Likewise , FEM ca n't compare with good film making for a number of reasons , and I actually believe it 's a poor example of independent filmography . From start to finish , FEM feels like a pieced together vlog . ( Heck , even MySpace gets some pimping . ) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - -I don't -- I'd go watch it . FEM , while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media , is so personal that it is without an interesting story . It 's like watching the mundaneness of life , which I think most would agree is very naturally boring . And yet the creators of FEM want us to applaud it , their very postmodern film about making a film . Cue my yawn.Ultimately , I come away not caring the least bit about any of it . I 'm shocked that I 'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review , even . It 's not that FEM is downright bad , because it is n't ; it has a few moments where I crack a smile or think that maybe -- just maybe -- something of interest is about to happen . It 's rather that it 's just downright ... mediocre . I feel so indifferent about it that it 's almost fitting of an oxymoron : passionate indifference.I hope the creators/""actors "" in the film get out of debt from their efforts . They 'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.See this movie if you 've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do ; otherwise , pass it by , and do n't worry that you 've missed some great , undiscovered talent .

I sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film . Yes , there are vampire stereotypes . Yes , there are scientific stereotypes covered here . Even martial arts stereotypes . All well and good , and sure , not all perfectly done . However , I sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location . The film is set in Pensacola , Florida , and does not try to avoid saying so . That 's a bold move in the film world today , and a rare treat for fans of indy films . And indeed , it may not be the last . Pensacola is world renowned as a Navy town , an aviation town , a lumber town , and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy . Rarely is it seen as a growing film town . But that 's all changing now . More film companies are coming in to shoot . And more native Pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves . This film is part of a growing trend of Pensacola - based indy films , and more are on the way . Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community , and by and by , the world is taking more notice . Watch and listen , world . The Pensacolians are coming . Like a virus .	1
"Watched both parts twice . Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero . He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain . I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the "" Lady in Distress "" . Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces . She did n't have the look of the woman of the 1800 's . The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well . I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older . Age is inevitable , but let 's not hide from it . A man at 50 + can be much sexier ( and , Patrick truly is sexy ) then a green youth , no matter how pretty . Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile ."	1
"The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 , and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the "" whole Earth "" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA , though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map , and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.Ah , a response : "" Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I 'd say is a charming , but weak and gullible argument . What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie ? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels . Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here ? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon - missions were a success , and that man now are true masters of the universe . Things are nearly never quite what they seem .. Just watch the movie , and I dear say you 'll see things a bit different than before . ""First off , weather data does n't come from NASA , it comes for met agencies around the world . Second , the weather data undermines a major claim in the film . Third , far from being "" packed with irrefutable evidence "" , the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked . Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film , so he edited it and added his own interpretation . Unfortunately for him , his source film is public domain , and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims ."	0
Seriously , I do n't even know where to begin . It 's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third - grader and said ' make me a movie about the secret service ' . The editing is ridiculous , the cinematography was random at best , every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well , was there even a director there ? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless ... and random .... and lame.Here 's a SPOILER for you ; this movie is the dumbest thing you 'll ever see . < br />However , if you liked this piece , you 'll also enjoy ; Deterrance , Dark Blue , and a partial frontal lobotomy .	0
"As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true - life tale , I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.THE BAD - I 'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played , but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbage - mouth . From what I read , there were several directors replacing each other on this film , and that 's too bad . You can tell things are n't right with the story . I could n't get "" involved "" with Treat Williams ' portrayal of Cooper , either . He should have been fascinating , but he was n't in this movie . It 's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of "" folk hero , "" but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy , too.Not everything was disappointing .

From the moment the film begins , already there is a discrepancy . As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the middle East , and is also an international film , one would expect proper accents portrayed . This is not done as the majority of the cast sound American . Also , I find the acting to be rehearsed at best , the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning . Who is who ? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery . If you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past ( albeit the lack of accents ) then this movie is worth a rent . If you 're looking for a movie as epic as Kingdom of Heaven , then look elsewhere .	0
First of all when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu , I was definitely excited . Brenda Song , one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel , would be doing martial arts and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie . The action was poorly constructed , the movie could n't have realated to anyone , the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked ... along with the plot . If you really think about it 's a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer , a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women , a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen , the watcher who bug 's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil . The idea just was n't all that original , the movie is waste of time .	0
First of all , I became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes ( cause of the bas screenplay ) . I do n't think this movie has any purpose . It 's boring from the first minute to the last .

"When I started watching the show I said "" Oh , no ! It 's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody ! "" . And indeed , the setup is almost identical , with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself , then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.But this is where the resemblance stops . The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha , while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few . The magical setup is a bit corny , because it 's about seven people , with seven servants , fighting for the Holy Grail , all servants being someone famous , half of all masters being from the same school , rules of engagement , etc . However , this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and , without comparing it with animes that I liked more , but were from other genres , I have to say that I was very pleased ."	1

""" Fido "" is to be commended for taking a tired genre , zombies , and turning it into a most original film experience .

It would be very easy to dismiss "" Fido "" as cartoon - like fluff , similar to "" Tank Girl "" , but the two movies are vastly different .

"This movie is pretty awful but I have some interesting information about it:It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff , AZ , as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona , AZ . A good bulk of the extras in the film are then - drama students from NAU . I was a freshman there that year , minoring in theatre , but for some reason I did n't get involved with the production . I did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact:There is a scene in this movie where two of the principals , as part of their hazing ritual , have to run naked into the woods . They are seen from behind in the movie , doing just that . The thing is , those are n't the actors at all but two guys I knew from the theatre department . The identity of these "" stunt posteriors "" will remain anonymous , at least to this website , unless they decide to , um , "" reveal "" themselves !"	0
"When you look back at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy 's Revenge , you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new .

Yes , there 's the creative deaths as usual , like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing "" Super Freddy "" but even scenes like that are n't used to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are just boring.This marked the official death of scariness to the series . Freddy seems to be the comedic relief now ... but to what?My Rating : 4/10"	0
A documentary without a loss for words ... ever ... Let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof , let us assume it is a commentary on Japanese society . And as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come , the constant wordplay , as fast is it goes , and as poorly translated as it is-- in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the Copenhagen Cinematek-- It is still quite enjoyable . < br />But for the patient , and ONLY the truly patient and open - minded , I 'm talking to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses , I believe this is a film for you . It 's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over.Quite beautiful , and quite kitsch , and quite Japanese sub - culture . And quite experimental . Static 2D in a 3D world . All in all , Fun for those that want to see a Japanese film that spoofs Japanese food culture . A thumbs up if you 're in the mood for something completely different .	1
Having never heard of this film until I saw the rental DVD I as a bit sceptical , there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that ca n't do anything film a bad script , and in some cases do n't seem to care.Well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release , it IS good . The story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry . I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake does here too with such a major role , OK he 's not Oscar material yet , but he 'll learn with each role and he shows a LOT of promise for the future here . Dylan McDermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie.Ultimately , just give it a go . you wo n't be disappointed , you wo n't be bored , in fact , I think you 'll be more than happy with the end result .	1
I sat with my children as we watched this film . We all found it to be a very entertaining movie.When Billy goes to a new school , a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms.A bet is made and Billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else . From this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook , fry or bake the worms to try and get Billy sick so that he will lose the bet.Billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone , even the bullies friends.I wo nt tell you if he wins the bet or not ... you will just need to watch it to find out but I will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one.P.S. Let me add that this movie is not just for boys , I have all daughters and they really liked it a lot .	1
"Following my experience of Finland for slightly more than a week , I 'd say this movie depicts the nature of the Finnish society very accurately . Especially the young - couple - with - a - baby - having - serious - issues phenomenon is very familiar to me , as I witnessed the exact same thing in person when I was in Finland . The relationships and problems of people , fragility of the marriage institution , the drinking culture , unemployment and the ascending money problem , all are very well put , without any subjectivity or exaggeration.There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other , but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding . Not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound , but as said above , the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of "" real life "" and captivate the viewer . I happen to think in a calm moment : What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street ? Well , this is what is happening . Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power . It would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries , but it particularly reflects Finland as it is , and pretty damn well.One comment about the acting : Being the fan of Finnish cinema I am , I 've never seen any of these actors on any other movie , but I found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall . Maybe not a masterpiece , but a very good try by the entire crew . I 'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast .. 7,5 / 10"	1
I 'm going to say first off that I have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought . I was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count . But that would be about it . Let me explain . I paid literally £ 1 for this DVD in a supermarket because I tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks , B - movies especially . But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons ( which I 'll touch on in a sec ) then it failed magnificently . Not only did it shoot for B and miss , it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts . I say above that it 's likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror , which can either be very good or very bad . For example , later Freddy films ( Dream Warriors onwards ) are all about Freddy 's style and nose - thumbing , which works out great ! But this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid . I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good . In fact , for about half an hour I liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find . BUT what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills . For instance , when ' Satan ' smashes the cat against the board and writes ' boo ' with it 's blood using its body as a brush . Or when ' Satan ' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman . Now I 'm not usually too against senseless kills in films - hey , that s the point , right ? But in those two cases I just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film - plot especially . For me , the film went downwards from then on . One major bad point about this film is that I hated every character in it . The kid , Dougie was just ridiculously annoying ! ! ! I 'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick ! I mean , come on ! ! ! I completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid , like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help , but this kid took the biscuit ! I wanted to kill him myself by the end of it ! It was completely unbelievable and if I had to hear him say ' duh ! ' one more time I was going to bang my head against a wall - because that s what watching this film felt like . Why did n't i just turn the film off ? Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film . But I was wrong in this case . The ending did NOT redeem this film , it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line . I get it already ! The killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else , be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume ! I GET IT ! This film made me physically angry because it was so stupid ! And if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film , watch out for the intestines . Frankly , if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that , I 'd be surprised he was n't already dead , let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair.In fact , I 'll even go so far as to say that the only character I liked at all in this film was actually the killer . Purely because when his ' comedy routine ' worked , it did work . All in all , the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down . Why was the killer killing ? I do n't know . I can live without knowing who he actually was , that s fairly typical , but without some kind of motive - hell i do n't know , i 'd settle for him having a bad Halloween as a kid ! -it just seems more than senseless , just stupid . Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid . In fact , i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with IMDb just so i could comment on it . Save your money , save your sanity . Stay away from it !	0
I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot ( 2001 ) . Now I know about four times as much ( I doubt I learned a whole heck of a lot from Not Without My Daughter ( 1991)).Offside is a splendid budget Iranian comedy about a group a girls ( working individually ) to attend a decisive soccer match for their country 's place in the World Cup . Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches , so the nation 's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves . Some ( teen ? ) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys , but are caught . The movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers , awaiting some unspecified punishment ( although , the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed!)The movie explores the absurdity of the situation . The thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago . This farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom , so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she ca n't see the graffiti . The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes : at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban.Fortunately , this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the Great Satan . You have to be in the mood for it , but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they wo n't get it .	1
Post - feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism.Spoiler alert ! < br />This underrated gem of a film tells the story of Flavia , a Fifteenth Century girl of Noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of Medieval Christian society by viewing a fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure.Unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent ( explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks ) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and , through butting up against a whole system of subjugation , repression and violence , inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her.Billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth . This is a film depiction the consequences of violence , the effects of patriarchal dominance , the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit.I described it in the title of this piece as ' post - feminist ' and in the end Flavia 's triumphs must always be corrupted , compromised and perverted by men . Even Flavia 's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men ( the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror.As to the much discussed violence : this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess . To have shied away from the violence would have limited the film 's impact , would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the Patriarchal discourse it is exposing . In addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society.Beautifully filmed , brilliantly acted ( notably by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares ) , containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years Flavia is a classic of European Cinema .	1
A bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all - night horror movie marathon . However , as the night goes on , there 's somebody among them killing them off one by one . Who is it ... and why ? I saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 . I was looking forward to it -- but boy ! It did not work at all . The premise is a good one , they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does n't work . The story stops making sense halfway through ( that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released ) , the killings are relatively bloodless ( how this got an R rating is beyond me ) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid.It 's really too bad -- this movie had potential . With a better script this could have become a great horror film . As it stands though it 's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it ( I heard Stone wo n't talk about this one ) . I give it a 3 and that 's just for the cast .	0
"For real film people , this film is a must , since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves . Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff 's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena . This light can do harm , or it can be harnessed to do good . On the one hand it blinds his mother , on the other it is used to cure blindness ( "" I can see ! "" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected ) . When Rukh / Karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light , we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative , drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection , an entity viewed on film ( only visible , as in a movie theater , when the lights are out).There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years , as the light from Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock . < br />There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles : that of the writer , in the persona of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens ; and religion , emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector / ray gun . < br />One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time , and particularly at Riefenstall 's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm : Triumph of the Will . < br />Happily in the end , Mother ( Violet Kemble Cooper ) intervenes , reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science . < br />If only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout : "" I can see ! """	1
Good work by everyone , from scriptwriters , director , and cast ; a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only ; a good film for television on those cloudy , cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy .	1
"This movie has a lot of comedy , not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one . He displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up . His training is "" unorthodox "" and who would 've thought knot tying could be so deadly ? ? Lots of great stunts and choreography . Very creative!Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you 've got an awesome final showdown ! Do n't mess with Manchu thugs ; they 're ruthless !"	1
"It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it 's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team . There are no parents or teachers to speak of , no school , and boys are represented by one peripheral figure , the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three , only aspiring to join the team she so much admires . She 's kind of odd looking . She 's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long , bony limbs , big feet , and no derriere to speak of . She 's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips . After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.Adele Haenel is older -- more , well , more developed physically . What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit , sauntering around , teasing the boys , swishing her long blond hair . But she 's not what she seems . Or is she ? I could n't quite figure it out . The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency . No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her.There 's not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere 's character . She 's on the team too but she 's dumpy and plain , and sensitive about it , and has an intense crush on Francois . Blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.The movie deals with the relationships between these three , meaning intrigues , deceptions , hidden feelings , and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another . This is of course a tricky topic . It becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele . Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie . The only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on , and what little sex there is under the covers , sometimes literally.I do n't think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much , partly because it 's suggestive rather than expressed through action , partly because it 's complex , and partly because I 'm not sure I got it all.Let me give an example . Okay . Adele is the girl the others envy . She 's also quite distant and self satisfied . On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all , from the handsome but dumb Francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from . She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio . When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team , Adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys . A superior and self - indulgent narcissist , you know ? But then the soi - disant slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she 's still a virgin . Really ? Yes , really . Pauline begins to draw closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she 'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her . Pauline , now drawn sexually to Adele , performs the task with subdued relish . NOW Adele would REALLY like to get it on with a man , preferably older and experienced . So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Pauline to the powder room . The two girls stand there staring at one another , neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other . But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins , reaches up , and kisses Adele on the lips . Adele steps back , smiling , and says , "" There now , that was n't so bad , was it ? "" , and then walks back into the club.That 's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between Pauline and Adele -- but what the hell IS going on ? Initially , Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child , later like a close friend , finally like a potential lover -- and the minute Pauline responds , Adele walks off satisfied . Is she USING Pauline the way she seems to be using men ? Does it satisfy Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude ? I do n't know.I've slighted Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio , the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity , but I 've only skipped her for considerations of space.Should you see it ? By all means . ( Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids . ) For men , some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique , this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot ."	1
"this movie was n't absolutely atrocious , but it was pretty bad . the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good ! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist , which is sort of his specialty if you do n't know such things : D. bill forsythe .. well , i 'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film . he 's way too good for this kinda stuff , and his role was n't exactly demanding . I rented this on the strength of those two leads , and I was n't really disappointed . I mean , heck , it 's a movie about a half man / half shark . It ai n't Shakespeare folks . Other than the plot , which is full of holes , and the poor dialogue , I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired . there were shots were they were trying to look "" cool "" , but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy . they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line . it was pretty bad . but if you are a jeffrey combs fan , this one is worth checking out . he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character . forsythe ai n't bad either , and either is the female lead . heck if i can remember her name though . bottom line , i would n't otherwise waste your time ."	0
"TIGERLAND / ( 2000 ) * * * 1/2 ( out of four)By Blake French:<br / > 	 Throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible , and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield . Joel Schumacher ( "" 8MM , "" "" A Time to Kill "" ) , easily one of the riskiest directors currently working , has found resemblance with "" The Thin Red Line "" in the way his new drama "" Tigerland "" steps in an individual soldier 's shoes . This movie , written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther , has more guts and irony than "" The Thin Red Line "" or even "" Saving Private Ryan . "" Although the movie 's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present , it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war . < br /><br / > 	 I would want to know Joel Schumacher 's experiences with the army . Are the men really this unabashed and brutal ? I am sure some of them are , but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz ( Colin Farrell ) , who is rebellious against the ideas of war . His personality instantly counteracts with several other characters , one who becomes his best friend , Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) , and another , Wilson ( Russell Richardson ) , whose flamed temper often exasperates Bozz 's tension with the idea of going to war . The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield , but on training grounds of a Louisiana - based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training . This film is specifically about the preparation for war , nothing more nothing less . It ends when the soldiers finally go to war , kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff . < br /><br / > Shot on location in about 28 days using 16 mm stock and a minuscule budget , Joel Schumacher accurately displays a gritty , perverse , cruel , and unmerciful atmosphere using hand - held cinematography , unique lighting techniques and direct sound . Schumacher 's grainy and blown - out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature . This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie , quite graphic in its use of coarse language , perhaps a little too disturbing . Waves of four - letter words pound the audience , some in shock of what they are hearing . Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking , true , and emotional.<br / > 	 If anything , "" Tigerland "" provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat . Such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war , knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken . Such thought - provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees . This movie is not for all audiences , but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army ... and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such . < br /><br / >"	1
"This is the biggest piece of lamo I 've ever watched . It is excruciatingly boring I would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was . Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1.The reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is "" unintentionally funny "" are absurd and just plain WRONG . Not one thing is funny about this movie . they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you would n't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you do n't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING . Honestly though , I did n't watch it to the ending , but that should say something about how horrible it is . WORST MOVIE EVER.Immediately after ejecting this filth from my DVD player I started scraping it against the cement in front of my house , not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie . Then Zach peed his pants . Thankyou for your time ."	0
"basically , i like Verhoeven film because in his film , i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in "" Basic Instinct"".it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie.well , it is his previous direction before his block buster hit "" Basic Instinct "" and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah , the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation.this movie "" The Fourth Man "" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences . the story of this movie is about a gay writer named "" Reve""(Krabbe ) , an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture , he introduce a seductive woman named "" Christine "" , who has a mysterious past she does n't want to reveal . Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.next morning , he watch her sexy , macho boyfriend 's picture on her table , the person he met at the station.he is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house.that 's it . i do n't want to reveal the entire story because it is a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!especially , i like the character "" Reve "" which is brilliantly played by "" Krabbe"".i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.i would like thanks Mr . Verhoeven to make such a black comedy.i rate this movie : 10 out of 10 ."	1
"I have watched anime but I 'm not a die hard fan ; and I do n't read manga . I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background . I have seen "" St. John 's Wort , "" and although it is n't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination , it made me pick up "" Shinobi , "" especially since everyone seems to love it.Well , I watched it this afternoon , and fought very hard to keep watching . Yes , it 's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes , the autumn leaves on the trees , even the CGI eye flicker - majestic . I liked the hawk , the costumes , even some of the fight scenes , but overall this was dull as dirt.It seemed as if someone took "" Romeo and Juliet "" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some "" X - Men "" for good measure . Two of the characters split Wolverine 's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey - haired guy had his ability to heal himself . Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that 's Poison Ivy ( from Batman ) . Why do they give these women such dumb powers ? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death . Man , that 's some great power for you . And the other girl , can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands . The other woman , one of the star crossed lovers , has the power of a hypnotic stare . Wow.I sort of made it to the end of the film , by fast forwarding it , and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected . Some people are comparing this to "" House of Flying Daggers "" and "" Hero . "" Do n't make that mistake . They may share similar endings , but that 's where the similarities end . "" Shinobi "" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.I would say avoid this film unless you 're 12 to 18 years old ."	0
"I love Claire Danes , and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role . The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery , working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial - arts - like discipline . The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed - to - be Thailand is eye - catching , but Claire Daines steals the entire movie , and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end , in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world . The flaws are minute and I recommend the film , which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings . I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only "" 10 "" rated films . Watch it , you will be very touched ."	1
"This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama . It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed . What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent . I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism . Rather than advancing an agenda , the filmmakers just told the story , told it well and let the viewer think about it . The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective . < br />A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget , without big studios , star actors , big - name directors ( this was far better than many of Hitchcock 's films ) , special effects or "" clever "" plot twists ."	1
"This early role for Barbara Shelley(in fact , her first in Britain after working in Italy),was made when she was 24 years old , and it 's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's "" Cat Girl . "" While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention(I'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard),the lovely auburn - haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability(one such example being 1960 's "" Village of the Damned , "" in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband , George Sanders).She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of "" Cat People , "" and is seen to great advantage throughout(it 's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase).Her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened(also exposed 8 years later in 1965 's "" Rasputin - The Mad Monk"").The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder(I do n't see what held that dress up , but I 'd sure like to).All in all , proof positive that Barbara Shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at Hammer 's studios in Bray , for the duration of the 1960 's ."	0
For long time I have n't seen such a good fantasy movie , magic fights here are even better than in LOTR , even considering that it 's a 1987 movie and have n't computer special effects . This movie have good plot , good acting and interesting ideas . Recommend everybody to see it .	1
I have seen this film on countless occasions , and thoroughly enjoyed it each time . This is mostly due to the lovely Erika Eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks . Plus , any film starring Tom Berenger and Dennis Hopper is bound to be entertaining .	1
Nope , I am just not going to get with it here . I refuse to go along with the program . Do n't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over - rated ? Look at the reader comments and their star ratings : Most are 6/10 , 7/10 or better . I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself , which is unique . How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles ? I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation , expecting fireworks , and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag . It looked great , but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending did n't do much to save it.The film 's background story says it all : Director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie , is informed the footage will not be appropriate , sets it aside , waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up , then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes , filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated , excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence . That the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd , original and shocking in a deliberate , calculated manner goes without saying . But we are n't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone , we must consider the entire film , and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie ? Or are they just enamored by it 's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it?Perhaps it is an anti - clerical agenda that appeals to them . Hating the western religions of catholicism and Christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- Just today it was revealed that the BBC routinely skews their broadcasts with anti Christian & anti Western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness . You can say anything you want about the Bible , pedopheliac priests , the institutionalized cruelty of the church , and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball ... But say one negative thing about non - westernized religions , and you are toast . This movie was tailor made for such a sentiment , with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old French boys complete with inappropriate touching , fawning , fondling , fumbling , groping , and patting of the backsides . Ewww.And then there is the horse couplings , photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry . Yes I understand the thematic relevance of the imagery -- large animal phallus 's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers -- but if I wanted to watch horses , you know , do it , I would like go live on a farm . Having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom.Is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants ? Probably , though I will grant the artistic execution of most of it , filmed in a kind of arty Euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a Monet painting , complete with a spanning arched bridge . And the ending ( which even I managed to be surprised by ) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package . But you have to remember that there are certain things that can not be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it . That is n't fair , and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about Iwo Jima . Whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes . The problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it Oscars because of it 's noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie.While it may seem like an odd parallel , I see one with THE BEAST : How can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating ? And who can not see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film 's explosive set - piece where Beauty and the Beast finally do the nasty ? Somehow I managed to miss both points , and am delighted that I have seen this film so that I can trash it as being what it really is : 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy - fartsy Euro Trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut , and a great ending . It 's art for sure , but it sucks hard.3/10	0
Oh Dear , Jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game , and he 's way out of his league . The script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff ( 80 's action B'movie king ) , Michael Jai White ( Last seen in the Sci Fi flop Spawn ' ) as well as Surviving the Games ' William MacNamara ( who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film ! ) stoop this low for employment . If you are a fan of Jerry then stick to his TV show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half . After I had finished sitting through this I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV , which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison , I think that says more than enough!!!<br / >	0
This is probably my favorite movie of all time . It is perfection in its storytelling . It will break your heart not because it 's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through . You feel for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time .	1
I thought this was a quiet good movie . It was fun to watch it . What I liked best where the ' Outtakes ' at the end of the movie . They were GREAT .	1
I 'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies , and I would n't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time , so I did go into this film with some hopes . However , it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that is n't going to go anywhere . Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more , but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it 's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting . As the title suggests , the film focuses on a ' rogue ' ; in this case one that steals , womanises and smuggles stuff . That 's basically all the plot that this movie has . The film does have a real ' seventies style ' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well . It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point , although whatever that point is does n't come across very well . Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure , and that is the case here too ; she 's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film . Overall , The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style , but unfortunately it does n't have much else to offer .	0
".... CAUSE IT 'S CRAP ! The kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say "" WHY ? "" . Horrible camera work ... count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and ca n't . The dialog is ridiculous . The acting is comical . It looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible . I 'd bet $ 10 they used home video cameras to make this . Either that , or most of the cameramen were drunk . Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie . If you ever want to host a "" Worst Movie Party "" , bring this one .

Stanley 's life is difficult , because he never learned to read or write . Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley . She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time . Over time they become romantically involved . After Stanley learns to read , he goes off to a good job in Chicago , only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.It 's a really good film without nudity , violence , or profanity , that which is rare in today 's films . A good film all round . < br /><br / >	1
Sometimes a film comes along that is unique . The Nostril Picker is one such film , The Nostril Picker is like no other film I have ever seen , unfortunately for The Nostril Picker & myself it 's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended . Read on & all shall hopefully become clear ... The Nostril Picker , as it 's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title The Changer , starts with some extremely dull shots of an American town somewhere , streets & factory 's that sort of thing , as the opening credits play . When The Nostril Picker begins proper we , the viewer that is , are introduced to a real loser named Joe Bukowski ( Carl Zschering ) who is in his 40 's , he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches T.V. , eats beef flavoured dog food & listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll . Joe likes teenage girls , he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more . However , being an ugly git Joe ca n't tempt any young ladies to go out with him , or do anything else with him for that matter . One fateful day an old homeless Vietnam vet ( Horace Grimm ) sees the agony & pain that Joe has to go through ( actually he sees Joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl ) & decides to help him out . He tells Joe about an incantation that he learned from the ' gooks ' in Vietnam that will transform Joe 's appearance into whatever he likes . A process he calls morphosynthesis , but at the same time he warns Joe that ' it makes you crazy if you do it too much ' . That night Joe decides to give it a try , in a public place on a podium for some reason . Joe says a few words , does an extremely silly dance & starts yodelling . Joe finishes off by whistling London Bridge is Falling Down , listen yeah , I ai n't making this up either . At first Joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens . To console himself Joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk ( Kevin Devoy ) refuses to sell it to an underage girl . Joe , the bright spark that he is , realises what has happened & talks his / her way out of it by claiming his / her dad had sent him / her to buy it . Joe , who now calls his alter - ego Josephine ( Ann Flood ) , senses the possibilities & heads straight for the local high school . Joe befriends four teenage girls , Jennifer Armstrong ( Laura Cummings ) , Crisi Stroud ( Gail Didia ) , Tracy Harper ( Heidi M. Gregg ) & Brenda Kearn ( Aimee Molinaro ) while under his disguise , oh & Joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher Miss Van Dyke ( Vicki Hollis ) . At first Joe seems harmless enough , he just likes to hang around the girls toilets & stuff like that . But things soon change as Joe brutally murders Brenda . Jennifer 's dad , Vince Armstrong ( Edward Tanner ) is a detective so along with his partner Ed Simpson ( Clyde Surrell ) & Walt Spencer ( Bruce Alden ) the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughter 's friends , but will they succeed before Joe strikes again ? The IMDb listing for The Nostril Picker is wrong , I watched it mere hours ago & it clearly states that it 's directed by Mark Nowicki who was also a co - producer & definitely not Patrick J. Matthews who was credited as a co - producer & the cinematographer , not that it makes much difference & I 'd have though that Nowicki would have been more than happy for Matthews to take the ' credit ' for making this piece of crap . No one involved in the making of The Nostril Picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again , ever . The Nostril Picker is easily one of the worst films I 've ever seen , & that 's saying something . It 's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable . The script by Steven Hodge is atrocious , there 's no narrative structure , excitement , tension , drama , character development & the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it 's untrue . The plot devices & chain of events in The Nostril Picker are totally incomprehensible . The scene where Joe finds out the prostitute ( Steven Andrews ) he hired is in fact a man & Joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo 's is simply jaw dropping stuff . The subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written & had me psychically laughing at the dialogue . I hated the ending as well , not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel , I psychically shudder at the mere thought ! On a technical level The Nostril Picker is awful , point & hope photography , bland & inappropriate music , forgettable locations , poorly edited ( Brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the T.V. screen that was clearly in the opposite room ) , some of the worst acting I 've sat through & very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers , a slit throat & a quick scene where Joe eats some flesh . It comes as no surprise that the cast & crew who worked on The Nostril Picker have virtually no IMDb credits for anything before or after . Even at 76 odd minutes The Nostril Picker is far to long & really boring to sit through . I could go on & on all day long about how bad The Nostril Picker is , I really could . One thing I ca n't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers ? The Nostril Picker is indeed a unique film , unique in it 's awfulness & incompetence . In the the case of The Nostril Picker I hope it remains unique too , having said that it 's still not the worst film I 've ever seen but it comes close that 's for sure . Definitely one to avoid .	0
"Yet again , early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that I otherwise would never have been able to track down . At four o'clock in the morning , I stumbled out of bed to begin recording ' The Informer ( 1935 ) , ' my fourth film from prolific American director John Ford , and an excellent one at that . Set during the Irish Civil War in 1922 , the screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols from the novel of the same name by Liam O'Flaherty . Though he was born in the United States , and is most renowned for his "" Americana "" pictures , both of Ford 's parents were Irish , which explains the director 's decision to direct the film . Victor McLaglen plays Gypo Nolan , a brutish but well - meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend , Frankie McPhillip ( Wallace Ford ) , in order to claim the £ 20 reward for his girlfriend , Katie ( Margot Grahame ) . When Frankie is killed during his attempted arrest , the Irish Republican Army , of which both Frankie and Gypo were members , begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident , every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit.Meanwhile , Gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend 's untimely death , and descends into a bout of heavy - drinking that rivals Don Birnam in ' The Lost Weekend ( 1945 ) ' in its excessiveness . As Gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol , trapped in a vicious little circle of depression , his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating IRA members . For the one time in his life , Gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers ( including an amusing J.M. Kerrigan ) , who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him "" King Gypo "" for his physical might . However , it 's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man , and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money . The additional £ 20 brought by Frankie 's death could never buy Gypo an assembly of friends  indeed , in a bitter twist of irony , the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions . A relatively simple fellow , Gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions , and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his "" not knowing what he was doing , "" but his foolishness must not go unpunished.Criticism is occasionally levelled at Ford 's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a "" terrorist "" organisation . Though this stance obviously depends on one 's personal views { I certainly do n't know enough Irish history to pass judgement } , there 's no doubt that the film portrays the Irish Republican Army as selfless , dedicated and impartial , a proud piece of Irish patriotism if I ever saw it . However , the main theme of the story is that of betrayal ; driven by intense poverty , one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend , and comes to deeply regret his actions . The tormented Gypo is played mainly for pity , and Victor McLaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence , culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death . ' The Informer ' was John Ford 's first major Oscar success , winning a total of four awards ( from six nominations ) , including Best Actor for McLaglen { who snatched the statue from the three - way favourites of ' Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1935 ) ' } , Best Director and Best Screenplay for Dudley Nichols { who declined the award due to Union disagreements } ."	1
I came in in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any credits or even its title till I looked it up here , where I see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators . I 'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as I watched : the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style . My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than John Williams himself . True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler 's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars . But in my opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I 've ever heard of his for tenderness , sensitivity and beauty , fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie . And another recent score of his , for Catch Me if You Can , shows still more wit and sophistication . As to Stanley and Iris , I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack , that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina , and Danny deVito 's Renaissance Man , etc . They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening , a story which ca n't be told often enough . This one is an excellent addition to that genre .	1
"I finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through , and I must say , I was very impressed . Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- it 's not only the fact that she * can * act , but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem . I 've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand , but I certainly disagree . Diana is a feminist . She follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks ( with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her trainer and manager , Hector , who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent ) , which is what the word "" Feminism "" is all about . It 's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism -- that they 're not a bunch of manhating losers -- but that they have dreams and can do anything . Diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love , and she and Adrian have a more realistic , complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out . Girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people . Thanks , Michelle.8/10 - A very important movie that 's relatable to not just young women , but everyone wanting to go far in their lives ."	1
"This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star , John Curtis Estes , better known as John Holmes . Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life . Maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead.The problem is , that the story is not very well told . There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland , and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto . Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is ( and no prosthesis this time around , unlike in Boogie Nights ) , and he is much better looking than mope Holmes . < br />The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast . The racist , immature lowlifes he hangs out with , or his wife , and the police do n't get much in the way of characterization . < br />The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to "" get lost "" . < br />Having said all that , anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime should n't miss it ."	1
This episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle . I imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors.The story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting.(Nicholas Lea makes his X - Files debut though not as Agent Krycek but as a victim called Michael ) I especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself.Its different but enjoyable . Ignore any bad reviews you may hear . Watch it for yourself and make judgement then	1
Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks , but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... I know it is low budget , but anyway : the actors behave like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago . I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies , but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished . But at least one good thing : the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to . The DVD cover promised a lot , but that is by far the best this film has to offer ...	0

This movie is one of my favourites . It is a genre - mixture with ingredients of the Action-/Horror-/Romantic-/Comedygenre . Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards . This minor flaw is easily ignored . There is so much to discover in this story . The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts . The visuals are beautiful too . The action is great which is no surprise , it is originating from Honkong , birthplace of the world 's best action movies . The humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way . Somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good . Absolutely recommended .	1
Oh dear we do n't like it when our super - hero love interest develops a brain do we?Something has happened to people , they have lost the ability to enjoy , a simple feel - good , love story / comedy ? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny , sexy and real . I laughed out loud ooh at least five times and I 'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too . The cast , acting and script is great , I watch a lot of films right across the board and I have n't seen one in this genre that has been as successful . Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some ! I 'm sure the book is good too but I think you have to judge it on its own merits .	1
"Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours . The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence . Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it was n't so interested in primarily looking good . Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad , or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits ( or in what I 'm guessing the reason for the "" unrated "" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts ) . The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie . If you get roped in to seeing this you wo n't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation ."	0
"It 's a pretty good cast , but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy "" Big Deal on Madonna Street "" Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original . William Macy may be one of our greatest living actors , but here he 's put to little use . And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni , so I sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes . Might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro . The art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story , the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed . Even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original . Sam Rockwell has his odd and genial charm and Luis Guzman has that odd charisma , but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat . It 's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made , but then again it 's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals ."	0
"There 's a lot of movies that have set release dates , only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind , and then put in limbo for a long time . You can only wish a film as rotten as "" Slackers "" remained in a coma for what it 's worth , which is miniscule . Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves . The premise kicks off under the guise of Ethan , a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela . Ethan devilishly enlists the aid of David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win Angela . I do n't like to give spoilers out , but for a piece of crap like this I can make an exception . Angela falls for David , Ethan intentionally screws everything up , the good guys win . That 's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre . Gross humor is funny , it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic "" Animal House "" , to the likes of contemporaries like "" There 's Something About Mary "" and "" Road Trip "" amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention . But when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far , case in point , Ethan has an Angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it . No one wants to take witness to watch Ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself . No one wants to watch a young man singing "" She 'll be coming around the mountain "" with a sock on his penis . But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50 's bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts at 71 years old . I do n't know if it 's the story 's lack of coherence , which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense . Director Dewey Nicks was a former fashion photographer , and after reviewing this film , you can only wish he 'll go back to the profession . The worst thing you can do on any film , is to make it look like you 're having fun , because you detract from your objectives , just like "" Slackers "" does , by burying it 's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags , pointless vignettes , and lack of construction . It 's like a bunch of college students got drunk , took one 's camcorder , and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together . If you want to see a teen gross out comedy that 's actually good , then I suggest "" American Pie "" and "" Animal House "" , or "" Road Trip "" , just something that 's entertaining , and not dreadfully bad like "" Slackers "" . Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes a cameo in this film , just as she did in another bad film such as "" The Sweetest Thing "" where the story treats gross humor like another plot , instead of a device much like this disaster .. If you pass by "" Slackers "" at your local video store , just keep on walking , and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves ."	0
The Plainsman is an entertaining western , no doubt a classic , which is actual even today . Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok , ideal for the role , together with John Wayne and James Stewart , they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation . Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane , nobody that I know played it better than her . Even if might not be historically accurate , the film manages to capture the most important about Hickok and about the time it takes place . Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to make your point and that is what DeMille does here . The friendship of Hickok with Buffalo Bill , the selling of rifles to the Indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war , Custer and Little Big Horn , the uneasy relationship between Buffalo Bill 's wife , a religious woman , with Hickok a man who had killed plenty , also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity all this makes ' The Plainsman ' a non conventional and interesting film . Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance , that already shows what a great actor he was going to become . A lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time .	1
"This movie is not for everyone . You 're either bright enough to get "" it "" or you 're not . Fans of sci - fi films who do n't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie . I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies . Everyone I 've recommended this film to has enjoyed it . If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks films , you 'll probably enjoy this one . The voice characterizations are done in a tongue - in - cheek manner and the one - liners fly fast and furious ."	1
Back in the 70 's , when I had first seen this , I was in high school . It was cool then . Now as an adult I look back at it and I say to myself .. yeah right . What was so funny ? It has it 's moments but they are few and far between . It is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up . Show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost . If you like this type of humor you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon . Tunnel Vision as well as Groove tube are too dated for today 's viewing .	0
"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point . And that 's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee ( Robin Williams ) intends to do in "" The Best of Times "" .

But ex - teammate Reno Hightower ( Kurt Russell ) is n't just going to go along with it so easily.Granted , it 's not the best movie for either man . But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team . And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles ( to say the least ) . Check it out ."	1
"Okay , so Robbie 's a little hokey - looking by today 's standards , and some of the acting is pretty stilted , and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program . And do n't get me started about the poster.This is STILL a great movie , 40 years after it was released . I grew up watching "" science fiction "" on the local TV station 's "" Science Fiction / Adventure Theater "" on Sunday afternoons , so I 've seen quite a few SF movies from the ' 50s . At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city , Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.I doubt that many SF movies made in the ' 90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030 ."	1
These two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive . This is definitely a movie about survival , but not without it 's touching moments.The finest piece of work I have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of New York City .	1
Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem . That is the first , most important , and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re - imagining Scooby - Doo and company.Shaggy 's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows . They 've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.I'm not sure what they 're on about yet with the villain angle , but it surely is n't following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted . I like it , but it 's not real Scooby - Doo type animation . But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me ; this might , too.It 's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice . That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly . Besides , I am trying not to be an inflexible , nitpicking fan . Evolve or die , as the saying goes . We 'll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then I 'll have formed a much more solid opinion .	0
"Forbidden Planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema , especially from the 1950s . There was The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds , but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from Shakespeare 's The Tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough . It 's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at ( though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates ) , but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we do n't know we 're channeling it.On the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard , if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the B - movies of the period . A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before . But the only one left is Dr. Morbis ( Walter Pidgeon ) and his daughter , who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead . Morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man , and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts , led by the Skipper ( Leslie Nielsen ) , can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on Earth.But there 's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship , one by one , every night , even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence , which the invisible something goes through easily . Meanwhile , there 's some romance possibly between the Skipper and Alraira , and there 's a more pushy vibe from the doctor : you should n't have come to the planet to start , and now you need to go . What happens from this is even more fascinating , just on a purely intellectual level , but Forbidden Planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas . While everyone may remember Robbie the Robot , and for good reason , perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail , animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of Fantasia.The acting from Pidgeon is subtle : you would n't expect him to be a villain , though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this , and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect . And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent , from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook ( who , I should add , helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides ) . And the effects for its time are extraordinary ( sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too ) , and the music , done by electronics , is beautiful in its "" tones "" . But ultimately it 's the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B - movie lot . When it 's meant to be funny , it 's intentionally so and it works . When it 's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors . And when we are made to think about a horrible situation , it comes on gradually , with nuance , not shoved in our faces or injected with mega - action.An inspiration for many other sci - fi films , and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time - old , it 's a classy and entertaining classic ."	1
Mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie . Do n't get me wrong I am not condemning the movie ; it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat . We need to understand Mahatma 's spiritual standing , he is a true spiritual leader . Only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones . A man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example . According to the movie , he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from , but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father . When things went wrong with Harilall , Mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy . < br />Had it been any other parents , they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet . Mahatma did n't do that , he is true leader who leads by example .	1
All Kira Reed fans MUST see this . The film 's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas . She 's also getting over a divorce . However , she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell ( and clothing ) . They go into a corner room and they do it . Thankfully , Kira gets a condom out ( Now do n't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft - core fluff . Remember kids , safe sex ) . Later , she marvels to her publishist how great it was , but she did n't get his name . Despite this , the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games . But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more . When she does , all hell breaks loose , and I 'll leave it at that . This is easily the best of these soft - core Playboys films I 've seen . Check this out , and marvel at the greatness of Kira .	1
"Ah , noir . My favourite genre . Otto Preminger 's follow - up to "" Laura "" is a film noir set in a postwar New York , where corruption and violence run rampant . It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon , a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors . < br />When he accidentally kills a murder suspect , Dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss Tommy Scalese . Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man 's wife , the beautiful Morgan Taylor . Of course , in typical noir fashion , things quickly go down hill.While the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise , it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom . Like most great noirs , it is also wonderfully paced , sucking the viewer in right from the start.Still , like most of Preminger 's workmanlike films , it 's not something I 'd watch again . It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder , the visual flamboyance of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles . Like Lang 's later work , "" Sidewalk "" feels very much a "" clone "" of what a noir should be , instead of something really artistically genuine . < br />Thematically the film is nothing special . It 's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal . In one scene Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook , the film flirting with the notion of predestination , but this one scene is as far as Otto goes , or dares to take his ideas.The camera work is likewise disappointing . There 's no intelligence in Otto 's camera . No effort is made to assign the camera to anything . It does n't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step - by - step police procedural . It 's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out . Meaningless , though most people do n't care about these things . < br />There is , however , one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters ( noir cage ) which itself enters a vehicle - lift ( another cage ) and is taken up into the chief gangster 's lair . Like Lynch 's "" Blue Velvet "" , Otto retopologizes the film , constantly likens "" upstairs "" to hell . This works well , but the set design fails to reinforce it . < br />7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian mould of what a noir is , rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go . Like "" Detour "" , "" Night in the City "" , "" Scarlet Street "" , "" In A Lonely Place "" , "" Act of Violence "" , "" Bomberang "" and "" Johnny Eager "" , "" Where the Sidewalk Ends "" is one of those well made second tier film noirs . It 's competent and engaging , but lacks that extra special magic ."	1
Unfortunately , this film has long been unavailable ( as other posters have noted ) , but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression , a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty - town . It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are just about the finest of their careers , and it 's a surpassing example of how the director , Frank Borzage , was able to create an almost fairy - tale aura around elements of poverty , crime , and horrendous social inequity , which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were . This film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need , and it is totally life - affirming . This is a real masterpiece of the period , and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known .	1
"A series of vignettes , most of them spoofing television of the 1970 's , but also with some digs at the government and corporate America . One of the longest segments , "" The Dealers "" is not that funny to me and I do n't know what it is parodying . Some of the others , though , are absolutely side - splitting . I particularly enjoy the cooking show segment . Most of the foul words I know are used in the movie , and , if you object to full frontal nudity , stay away ."	1
"So let me start off by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain . I was really bored one fine 1997 day and so I biked over to the movie rental store . I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was . Without hesitation he walked me over to "" Lucky Stiff . "" He told me that he 'd waive the $ 1 rental fee ( he said it would be wrong to charge more ) if I promised to watch the whole movie . So watch it I did , for free ... This movie is terrible . God - Awful even . I do n't need to go into plot details , read the other reviews . The jokes make no sense . The acting was terrible . I know it was supposed to be a comedy , but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting . You might try to watch it as something to laugh at , but it 's so bad that it is n't even funny in that way . Avoid !"	0
Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography , Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we 've all come to expect . This is almost a silent film , with what dialogue there is in German , and highly simplified German at that . Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience , as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles . The story is of little importance anyway , with the film succeeding on a cinematic level , not a narrative one . Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters -- there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr -- and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer , Vertov , and Riefenstahl . If the film has any message to convey , I think it 's a political one : bourgeois man is timid and impotent ; working class man is a happy , productive creature ; and woman is the creator , destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child . This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does n't overwhelm the film by any means -- it 's a beauty to watch from beginning to end -- but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era . And , oh yeah , Hedy does get her kit off .	1
I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci - fi flick . For one thing , it was directed by Tim Burton . Another thing , it 's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic . I found it boring , gross , and ridiculous . If you 've seen it , you know what I mean . Just about everyone at Imdb say it 's crap and boy , are they right ! If you have n't , avoid it . It 's a snorer . 1 out of 10 .	0
Sometime in 1998 , Saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand - new Ninja Turtles live - action series . Naturally , being a fan of the TMNT back in the day , this obviously peaked my interest . So when I started watching the show ... to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement . Some time later ( more like recently ) , I got a chance to revisit the series.First off , let 's talk about some of the positives . They managed to re - create the Turtles ' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this . There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot . And the Turtle suits , while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot , were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show . But you can only have Shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain ... and besides , most fans do n't realize or do n't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic , the Shredder was offed in the very first issue ! Never mind the countless resurrections that would follow . So on a personal standpoint , I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode . I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable.Unfortunately , they end up replacing him with these original villains who , as stated , seemed more fit for a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show . And with these new magic - wielding generics comes a new female magic - wielding turtle , the infamous Venus De Milo . I 'll be honest ; I never got comfortable with her . I 'm not against the idea of a female turtle ; I 'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain . I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the Venus De Milo show dealing with her make - believe enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power ( or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released ) . Fortunately , they all share the spotlight together.Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it . Given time and maybe another season , I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness . But while the idea was sound , the execution was flawed ( although there are a couple good episodes in this series ) . As it stands , Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten .	0
When his in - laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs , a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend , forced to take the rap by the gang , to Tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way.The Decoy is a real - life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films ! It 's talky , illogical , slow , and ultimately very boring.There 's some good costumes , sets , and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink , who apparently had too much money on his hands.They used to make westerns like this , that were under an hour long . Trim this of about half it 's length and you might have something watchable .	0
Gandhi My Father is a well made movie . It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji 's Eldest Son Harilal . His character , his differences with his father , his love for his family , his desire to stand on his own , his failure , his ego .. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal . Just not him , everyone did well in the roles they played . Darshan Jariwala is the best on - screen Gandhiji I 've ever seen . But I will cut three points as there were few shortcomings.First , movie was fifteen - twenty minutes longer than it should have . Second , the movie needed more research into Harilal 's character . Somewhere , the character looked incomplete . Also , his relation with his brothers was not shown . There was no mention of any other child of Gandhiji in the whole movie . I believe the character like Harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well , considering the egoist nature of Harilal.Anyways , despite some shortcomings , I liked the movie . Recommended ...	1
This movie is incredible . If you have the chance , watch it . Although , a warning , you 'll cry your eyes out . I do , every time I see it , and I own it and have watched it many times . The performances are outstanding . It deals with darkness and pain and loss , but there is hope . This movie made me look at the world differently : vicarious experience , according to my English teacher . Also , if you 've seen it , note the interesting use of shadows and light . Home room is a phenomenal movie , and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting , amazing plot , and heart - wrenching dialogue . Very tense , very moving . Does n't give all the answers , but makes many good points about humankind	1
The Ogre does n't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 , and I guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle ' Demons 3 ' in order to help it sell better . Well , the film is directed by Lamberto Bava ; the man behind the first two Demons films , and ogres and demons are somewhat alike ( in that they 're both ' monsters ' anyway) ... but other than that , this film has no connections to the other two films . It is , however , rather good ! Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films , and while it 's not completely obvious ; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from Hellraiser . The plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in Italy . She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement . It 's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return ... and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there 's a murderous ogre living in the basement.The film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for Italian TV , so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant ; but for what it is , this is certainly a very decent horror film . Lamberto Bava may not have as keen an eye as his father Mario did ; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well . The central setting , a large castle , makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and Lamberto makes the best of it ; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times ; such as the Inferno - style pool scene . The plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange ( particularly between the husband and wife ) . There 's not a great deal of bloodshed , but Bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects . The ogre itself looks really silly and it 's a good job that we do n't get to see it very often . We do boil down to a fitting , if highly predictable , ending and overall I have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended .	1
So - so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis , who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west . The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book ; Pitt 's a serial killer on the lam ( unbeknownst to Dave ) and Juliette is his poor , not - all - there companion . This is a good cast and the story moves along , but Pitt is n't belivably scary as a serial killer , although it is one of his better earlier roles . The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes , who always manages to shine , whether in her roles on ` Homicide : Life on the Street ' or in the brief series ` Wonderland . 'Vote : 6	1
"I think I truly love this film . "" Prix de Beaute "" was originally a silent film but later dubbed into French in 1930 . Despite having someone else 's voice dubbed over hers , this remains a stunning tour de force for Louis Brooks . The fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception . < br />This is the story of Lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend , Andre ( Georges Charlia ) and their friend Antonin ( Augusto Bandini ) . Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs : we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume . Lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome Andre . When Lulu considers applying for the title of ' Miss Europe ' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of Easy Street . < br />The film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women . We see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them . But at the center of it all is the magnificent Louise Brooks . < br />If you do n't mind watching films from the bygone eras , then consider checking out this one . Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you 'll want to know more . Also check her out in ' Pandora 's Box ' if you can find it.Be wary of the US Kino DVD release . I do n't know if their projection speed is correct . A lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed . This may have been the way they were shot . I do n't know . But since it 's the only way to see this film , it 's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill ."	1
"Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras . By the last few years of the Thirties , swing - style big bands were recording the year 's biggest popular hits . The Swing Era , also called the Big Band Era , has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949 . Although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the Swing Era began , Benny Goodman 's engagement at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream America 's youth . When Goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society - style dance music that his band had been playing , the youth in the audience went wild . That was the beginning , but , since radio , live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena , it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts . In Hollywood Hotel , the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste ( the film was in production only a year and a half or so after Goodman 's Palomar Ballroom engagement ) . There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel , but except for Benny Goodman and His Orchestra 's "" Sing , Sing , Sing , "" there is n't a lot to commend . Otherwise , the most interesting musical sequences are the opening "" Hooray for Hollywood "" parade and "" Let That Be a Lesson to You "" production number at the drive - in restaurant . The film is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing ."	0
what can i say ? , ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever , and like a Italian American , fan number one of female beauty i ca n't forget this movie.you know i really do n't remember a lot about the plot , or the situations or the other actors . i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous Erika and that in this film she looks better than ever , i really do n't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie , i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating Erika 's beauty.Well just to conclude if you are an Erika Eleniak 's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you .	1
It was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh , innovative , and original show . This makes every show I 've ever watched look plain boring . The moment the first episode aired I was entranced and I became attached to all the characters so easy ( which usually never happens because I always hate a few characters ) . It is a pity this show wo n't have a third season , because it has to be one of the best shows I have ever seen and that is n't exaggerating my feelings for the show at all . Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies , because what could ABC possibly find to replace this show ? This is easily the best show on television . < br />I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the entire show .	1
Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival . I was n't expecting a lot ( though the festival 's director told me it was one of the best films submitted ) . Five minutes into it I was sold . Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget , this film is hilarious . The acting is solid , the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid . The acting is probably the biggest revelation , since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting . Not this one . It features one of the most convincing , endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette 's Syndrome I 've ever seen . The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous . If you get the chance , see this movie . Filmmakers like Majkowski ( hope I got that right ) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience .	1
I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second , as someone else wrote in a comment , the implications of this kind of relationships ( incest and lesbianism ) in the romanian society.so ... to begin with the second aspect ... to make it short , it was n't visible at all ... as for the first .. as i said , it had much more potential ... i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension ... much more tension ... and the potential tension did n't get through ... i think the soundtrack could 've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme ( wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments ) ... yeah ... i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .. the actors ... i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in the key moments ... a total of 7/10 .... mostly for the story	1
I saw his movie in Dallas , Texas when it came out in 1986 . I remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie . After seeing the movie I can see why . The movie was not bad , nor was it great . The problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story . They created a new story , new characters and tried to wrap it around the Masters Saga . My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking the Earth . They even used the same scenes from the Master Saga but with different dialogue . As a kid , I loved the movie . But unfortunately I have n't seen it as an adult and ca n't give a better review . Looking back I was disappointed but now I would love to see the movie and re - evaluate my stance on it . That being said , will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge ? I love Robotech and ca n't wait for The Shadows Chronicles .	1
"This film is not morbid , nor is it depressing . It -is- sad , because AIDS in the early ' 90s -was- sad . But its real message is one of love and perseverance.Mark and Tom were in a long - term , loving relationship . Their devotion to each other is evident right away , and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives , you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.When "" Silverlake Life "" was originally released , I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care , volunteering as a counselor at an HIV / AIDS clinic . The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could , because Mark and Tom were real people , living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life . I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant , young , healthy people ; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real - life friends deteriorate . It touched me in a way that , even all these years later , still affects me ."	1
i just watched the movie i was afraid it 's gon na disappoint me . i was rather surprised at the end though . The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times . yes , it wo n't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones . beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had.it is not gon na become a classic as the first two already did . but what the hell - it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school . beta house deserves 6/10 but i gave it 7/10 just for being another slice of PIE .	1
"Writers Perry and Randy Howze crafted a very engaging little story in "" Chances Are . "" < br />Using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife 's home many years later , the plot takes unexpected , delightful turns.Twenty four year old Robert Downey , Jr. renders a delightful performance , ably assisted by Cybil Shepherd as the widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend . < br />This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper , playing off one another with a graceful style . I 've watched this film a number of times on tv , and each time found it most enjoyable ."	1
I live in Missouri , so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me , this brought it home . That two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of FDNY and NYPD did , just to document the horror that unfolded on that day . This film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings .	1
John Candy . Need we say more ? He is the main reason you should see this film . Most people do n't realize how gifted he was as an actor . Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk . Just a simple(subtle ) facial change and off we go . There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits . The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John(in a trance ) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend . I 'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude . It is , but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit . The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty(both SCTV alumni with Candy ) are not given enough to do in the film . Levy has his moments , especially filming the wedding at the end(think Rod Serling ) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone . Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid . I give this one 4 out of 10 .	0
"This was a truly insipid film . The performances are third rate , and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died . My reason for renting this was simple : Find a movie with scriptwriting . I needed a visual aid for my presentation , so I figured why not use a clip ? Boy was I wrong . After searching my local video store , I came upon this , where it was suspiciously titled "" Starstruck "" . I thought , "" What the hey "" , and decided to give it a try . Well , I was very unhappy with my results . There was maybe one scene I could use , and meanwhile , I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick . So ..... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood . There 's a movie I can use as an example . Then again , anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is "" Starfucker "" ."	0
This movie is about basically human relations , and the interaction between them . The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past , doing an analysis of how she lived her life . This journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home . It is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life , and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy , real love , marriage or destiny . although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new , this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas . There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable , but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed . I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon .	1
"Ok , I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to represent . But this is just awful . I am amazed it got such a decent overall score . The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the ( mostly ) marginal splatter effects . Do n't get me wrong , gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me ( like the anal "" probe"" ... that was great!).I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder . C'mon - rent a Betacam at least , I 've seen porn with better production values ( and better acting as well).Acting - sucked ! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way.Story - contrived ! But that s what you get from films like these . Very loose!Sets & Props - sucked ! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween.Dubbing and dialogue - sucked ! Horrible voice acting ( I should n't even call it acting ) and every other word is "" S**t "" or "" F**k"".There are tons of good classic and B rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down . Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap !"	0
"Letting the class watch this in English was a bad idea . Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect , but it appears this one did n't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left , conversations quickly started - and I did n't hear the words "" Shakespeare "" or "" Tempest "" being used at all . And when you look at this , it is easy to see why . The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits , just reading from the page without a care in the world . Shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death , but I just could n't understand a word anyone was saying . The costumes are n't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film , but they were n't exactly taking the p*ss either . But it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy . The scenes on the ship at the start of the film were n't too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic , everything else was done well and good . But where were the severed heads and exploding masts ? Where was the death ? Where was the inspiration ? The character of Ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes - but as all was on show , he was just another excuse for a joke . This film is not in any way appealing to either sex . The women and girls wo n't have any romance or comedy to enjoy , and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off . The Tempest was n't badly done , but this felt like something the producers HAD to make , not something they wanted to make . And the general boredom and lack of inspiration show . 3/10"	0
"I saw this film at a store in the cheap section . I actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago . I thought "" What the hey ' and bought it , basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes ( this was also before I became a huge Kate Beckinsale fan).So it 's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in Bangkok , get busted for narcotics ( which they are innocent of ) and then are sent to a Thailand prison . The film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence.Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances , and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally , and raises some nice moral discussion questions.I think this is a solid good film , but there could have been some improvements . It could have been longer ... it would 've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of Thailand 's justice system would 've helped.Nevertheless , other than that , it 's a good film with some great performances.P.S. For all you pop - culture junkies be on the lookout for a two - minute role by Paul Walker . I did n't even notice him the first time I saw the film ."	1
"Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity . In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance . WWII was still a few years away . Fred and Ginger dance up the town.The plot is decent , but who cares ... By the way , notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball.A load of Irving Berlin songs , including the famous "" Let 's Face the Music and Dance "" . In that scene , Ginger 's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious . Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless.Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred , since she had to do all the same moves , in step , and backwards ... Come to think of it , Fred 's voice was nice too . The man was effortless in motion.Here 's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved - one , kick off the shoes , and enjoy the entertainment ."	1
How did this ever come into existence ? I generally love sci F / Bigfoot whatever films etc . . . but I still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this . The effects were sad , the lines were sadder . Avoid at all costs . I only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case ( I was looking for the Sasquatch film with Lance Henrikson in it -- still have n't seen that one ) . The idea of the film is actually a good one . There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here . I just do n't understand how something like this ends up like this . Go speak to the film / arts / English interested students in any high school and you 'll find people who can write a better script .	0
"Prior to watching "" Dahmer , "" I thought no movie could be worse than "" Freddy Got Fingered . "" I was wrong . To sum "" Dahmer "" up , it 's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer 's encounters with gay men before they were killed . There is no plot to be found , and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about "" Dahmer . "" All you 'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men . Horrible acting , horrible directing , horrible writing , horrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching "" Dahmer "" and projectile vomiting for three hours , go with the vomiting .... it wll be less painful ....."	0
This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me , as well as a 9/10 . Here is why : As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd , where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration , this movie WILL bore you . It 's basically a family drama similar to what you 'd see on the Lifetime channel , but put in a horror universe . The story and formula are age - old , retreaded hundreds of times . If you 're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts , you 'll be disappointed . Take away the zombies and you 'll have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind , tripping on cheese . This is the 6/10.However , the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over - the - top . It 's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you 're half - drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release . The idea gets a 9/10 from me . The only reason it is n't perfect is because they could have taken it even further , but they didn't.The mix of both is mixed . I thought it was funny , but as with most all comedies , it was n't THAT funny . I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted . There were moments of utter genius , but there were also moments of pure boredom.I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over - the - top risk and original ideas . I just ca n't say it was perfect , or even near it , because of the lack of originality to the plot.A GREAT family movie . A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys ( or girls ) . A great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone , it will be a bit boring . Other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer.4/10	0
"Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey , John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace . This movie sucks on so many levels it 's pathetic . The first VAMPIRES was fun , but this low budget retread makes me yawn.Jon Bon Jovi ( the poor man 's Kevin Bacon ) drives around Mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas 's guitar case in DESPERADO . He picks up some lame "" hunters "" along the way ( including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire ) , and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest ( to walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so ) . If you 've seen the first VAMPIRES , you 've already seen this , and done much better.John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately . Frankly , I think he 's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic . The only decent film he 's done since THEY LIVE ( 1987 ) is VAMPIRES . Everything else is complete crap , right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid . Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 , HALLOWEEN ( 1 ) , ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING?Carpenter crony Wallace proves he ca n't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper - thin script packed with yawns , groans and recycled gags from the original . Did I mention I hated every character in the movie ? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film . How does that happen ? This film has nothing to recommend it . Not even the DVD presentation is good ; the menu looks awful.By comparison , JASON X : "" FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE "" was a masterpiece . Now that is how you make a sequel and ( re)energize a franchise , ladies and germs , as well as create an exciting DVD menu ."	0
"This movie was absolutely pathetic . A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes . At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead . I could n't even sit through the whole movie . Emran Hashmi disappoints , and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all . Celina Jaitley was not bad . The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris . It was pretty hilarious . The songs "" Sini Ne "" and its remix version were really good . You can always count on Emran lip - locking and lip - synching a chartbuster . All in all , it seems Emran does n't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time ."	0
I loved this movie . I knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series . I found it very heart warming to see Adam West , Burt Ward , Frank Gorshin , and Julie Newmar all back together once again . Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60 's should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave . You could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film , especially Adam West . And I 'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so . I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it ... now they wished they had . I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS . Now this movie will join my collection . Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt .	1
"Wow . I have seen some really bad movies in my time , but this one truly takes the cake . It 's the worst movie I 've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration.As a US Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan , I found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film , not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at "" authenticity "" to be found anywhere in the film . Not so much as the tiniest little shred . It seemed like it had been written by an 8 year - old child who got all his notions of war ( and soldierly behavior ) straight out of comic books . The film was made in Honduras , which should have been a clue , but even that ca n't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché - ridden piece of trash.I could try to list all the endless technical flaws , but it would take virtually forever . From the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since WWII , and the character 's name tags , like "" ColCollins "" ( worn by the character "" Colonel Collins "" ) , which was actually spelled using the reversed , mirror - image "" N "" of the Russian alphabet ( not the US alphabet ) the list just goes on and on . The uniforms , the equipment , the plot , and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves -- every single scene was just chock - full of ridiculous flaws , inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés.Neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable . It was all laughably childish , in the extreme . This was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre - pubescent boys , and I have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd.In short , this film has absolutely NO redeeming qualities at all . It 's a total waste of time . I 'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by ; it 's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for ."	0
Simply well written , directed and acted ... Woody 's best of the 2000 's if not his best since the 80 's ! ! Hugh Jackman was the perfect pick for his roll . Scarlett Johansson 's banter with Woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become.It 's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady . He plays the perfect bumbling magician.There have been a few reviews maligning this movie . Do n't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film . People in the crowd I saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line . If you like Woody Allen films of the 70 's , you 'll regret missing this one.I suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind , if you do , you might walk out smiling .	1
"This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early ' 50 's and it 's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there.The movie got directed by the genre expert Vincente Minnelli and stars Gene Kelly in the main lead . Both did quite a few movies together back in those days , of which this one is probably their best known one . < br />The movie itself actually managed to win the best picture Oscar over the year , which meant it beat out movies such as "" A Place in the Sun "" , "" A Streetcar Named Desire "" , "" The African Queen "" , "" Quo Vadis "" , "" The Blue Veil "" , "" Death of a Salesman "" that year . A real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful , bright and entertaining movie.When you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all , which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie . The musical numbers are also all nicely done , which is no big surprise when you have people such as Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work . < br />But really , could n't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so ? I mean , we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible . Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts , it just makes it a bit overlong . The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it.One of the better MGM musicals , that is not without its flaws though.8/10"	1
I was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12A here in the UK . To my dismay , this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes . ( Which is not a problem to me as an adult , but not good for watching with children ) . This film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes , getting hit in the groin etc ... and for the most part of the film not very funny.The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims who is a 2inch midget , gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag . So the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby , getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.Up until now , I have enjoyed most of the output from the Wayans Brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.A Bit of good advice - wait till it comes on TV or Cable	0
I loved the story . Somewhere , a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film . Well maybe there ought to be . I thought everybody seemed really human and believable . What a top notch cast . What great music on the soundtrack . What a nice this , and what a nice that , but most of all , I will say two words to recommend this film.Steve Carell.He really showed a nice , subtle depth that touched me . He was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first , at the cost of denying his own needs.Did he act like a petulant ass ? Why , yes he did.And you see , that 's what was perfect about this film . The actor who played this character made me believe he was FEELING something , and not simply ACTING like he was feeling something , and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling , and what he was feeling was denied.Denied happiness.Denied fulfillment.Denied love.Losing your love is painful beyond belief , and many who do so will never feel something like that again.Beautiful film.I gave it an eight out of ten .	1
"First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American . I do n't love Country music but I can stomach it . I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats . I do n't live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home . What does that have to do with this comment ? A lot if you are one of those people who say only "" country "" people love this movie . This movie is loosely based on the "" They loved and lost "" premise . James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets . In an era of Jerry Springer and "" Lets put it out there "" mentality , this film rings truer than ever . < br />Bud is "" coming of age "" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them . Bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford . He quickly meets Sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs . < br />(*This plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked . Marriage is a focus here that is often missed . Early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married . The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man . It also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.)Bud is challenged and is excited when Micky 's puts in an electronic bull . Sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start "" acting like it . "" The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they ( NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE STORYLINE AWAY ) split and Sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty . She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me . John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition . He was believable and real . The scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar .. still gives me goosebumps . Mind you I am not a huge Travolta fan , but come on , I see why Sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film . Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to Bud , after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up . < br />The supporting cast was incredible . Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused Sissy . Madolyn Smith - Osborne , as Buds Mistress / girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the U.S. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film . My biggest kudos 's go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud 's aunt and uncle . They seemed like someone 's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and however small their role , they made the film so much bigger and lifelike . Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death . The dialog between them is touching.If you can watch this for what it is , a true American love story . Then I recommend that you take it for what it is ... a film before it 's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment . If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more . Lastly , the music however dated , is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age ."	1
"It 's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie . Not that I have n't tried , mind you - but I sit down , and I pop in the aged VHS , and I watch the opening ... and suddenly I 'm five years old again and clutching my very own Care Bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart.I can see , objectively , that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising - mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation . But my inner five - year - old goes , "" Yay ! Care Bears ! "" every time I think about it . So - I 'd only ( cautiously , reluctantly ) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it ( like me ) OR those lovably cynical Gen - X / Y - ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad / strange ( a category in which this movie ... definitely belongs ) . To those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment : You might want to keep looking ."	0
"( No spoilers , just plot details ) I ca n't understand such hatred for this episode . You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville ? Watch Subterranean - now there 's a sack of crap . Tom Welling gives a good performance ( I do n't say that very often ) , and Michael Rosenbaum is great , but he is most of the time . The alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic . The Martian Manhunter , who previously appeared in "" Static "" , returns and tells Clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone , and if Clark wants to return to his universe , he must kill him . An overall great episode , with good acting and a decent pace ."	1
This movie is not as good as all think . the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic - like . I respect fantasy but Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan .. is fantasy ...

"I got to see the movie "" On Thin Ice "" on the television in India .. I must say the movie was really well done , and really sent a chill down my spine .. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted ... however , I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best ... the scene where she has cravings , and begins rummaging her home for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good , and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is .... The script is well done as is the cinematography and direction .. and casting < br />A must must watch movie ..... for everyone"	1
"In 1978 a phenomenon began . The release of John Carpenter 's "" Halloween "" got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers . The critics loved it , the world loved it , it was imitated , and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.plot : 15 years after a murder took place , four friends ( all females ) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends ) on Halloween night . After escaping from a hospital the night before , Michael myers Returns to his home town to stalk these people . He murders 3 of them silently and subtlety . He does not speak . He walks slowly . He hides .... Only one of the friends escapes , after being saved by Doctor Loomis ( Michael 's pursuer and doctor ) < br />There is one reason why Halloween works so well . Simplicity . We do n't know where Michael is , we do n't know why he kills , and he frightens us . They 're the only reasons why we are afraid.John carpenter wrote the movie , and directed . He builds unbearable tension throughout the story , and scares to such a degree , that sometimes we can not watch . And the climax is truly startling.As horror , this is essential . It is terrifying and well acted . It is also mysterious . Michael is a force , not a human . A force that can not be denied.The sequels focused too much around Michael and his "" history "" . This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown . Perhaps that 's why this thing is a masterpiece ."	1
"Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... I would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10 . Where to begin , we 'll start from the top ... THE STORY : Do n't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars , and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are . It 's a draub , basic , go to cabin movie with no intensity or "" effort"".THE SCREENPLAY : I usually give credit to indie screenwriters , it 's hard work when you are starting out ... but this is crap . The story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie . The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of "" Woah , you totally freaked me out "" and "" I was wondering if you 'd uh ... if you 'd like to .. uh , would you come to the cabin with me ? "" . It makes me want to rip out all my hair , one strand at a time and feed it to myself.THE CHARACTERS : HOLY CRAP ! ! ! ! Some have described the characters as flat , I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch .. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards ... THE ACTORS : Worse than the characters are the actors . They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting . The "" Woah you totally freaked me out "" was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down . I could complain for hours on the actors alone.TECHNICAL : LIGHTING : An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie . Too shadowy in areas , too bleached in others . The director should n't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly . Baby Steps ! SOUND : How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie ? 9 . With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured . There is one scene in particular that really sticks out , these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle .... WEAK ! CAMERA : Learn to use it.Anyway , I 'm running out of complaining space ..... rent it - I dare you ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it.Signing off ...

Presenting Lily Mars ( MGM , 1943 ) is a cute film , but in my opinion it could have been better . Judy Garland is great as always , but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops all too quickly.I mean , one minute he 's ready to beat her butt , but the next minute he falls in love with her . I believe that this production , the film editing , and the script ( even though the photography was great , the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well ) could have been a little better . It feels as though the production was too rushed . < br />The supporting cast was good as well , especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie . She at the age of 11 , looks really cute and it 's a shame that she did n't develop into a teenage comic actress . She 's much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930 's ( except for Broadway Musketeers 1938 , she 's really good in that ) , when they tried to make her into a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid . Overall , this film could better , but in the end , Judy gave it her all .	1
I saw this film yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact , I know one of the actresses from the film .. I wo n't say who .. ! ( That 's kept under wraps .. ) But I must admit , it was n't as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini ? Hats down to this guy .. But it 's a shame he was n't in the film for long .. What lacks the film is the idea , the script , sound , etc .. It may look like a good movie .. but it was n't that entertaining .. Well , I 'm glad my Sister paid £ 10 for renting 3 DVD 's from Blockbuster .. I chose this one .. and I was disappointed . Anyway , thumbs down for me .. ! Not my cup of tea ! 0 out of 10 !	0
"I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it 's getting talked about ! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason , they are usually true . But there really was n't anything funny about these stereotypical characters . The "" fresh of the boat "" dad , who does n't understand his daughter . The radical feminist Muslim daughter ( who by the way is a terrible actress ) , and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can ( he 's a pretty good actor , i only see him getting better).it is very contrived and the dialog does n't flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed , and do n't really care to watch another episode.I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again , she 's always a treat and a natural at everything she does , too bad her daughter in the show does n't have the same acting abilities !"	0
"Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is , what a great director she 'll one day turn out to be , etc . I think they 're just being nice . Even Kimble Rendall , who directed this film , shows more talent than she does . "" The next Jane Campion "" , they call her ; and , even apart from the fact that they 're both over - rated , the two have SO much in common . They both direct movies . They 're both women . They 're both Australian . ( Well , give or take.)Yep : it 's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant , and we just have to swallow hard and accept it . But I 'll say this for Carruthers : she 's cute . -And fascinating . No , really . Here are some thoughts on her lack of talent:(1 ) Part of a director 's talent lies in dealing with people . Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her ? So as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed , I expect.(2 ) Why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set I have ever seen ? After all , it must have been filmed on a REAL movie set . How could they get it wrong ? If Rendall 's set was half as much of an under - staffed shambles it 's a wonder he completed his film at all.(3 ) Carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick . Fat chance . I doubt it can be done these days . I suspect that Rendall - the actual , and more talented , director - set himself the same task , realised it could n't be done , and settled for ( sigh ) knowing parody instead . Of course , it 's not ENOUGH of a parody to work as a parody . As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well , less badly.(4 ) And yet , and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honest - to - goodness pastiche of 80s horror , starring ( this is too good to be true ) Molly Ringwald . This pastiche is much better than anything that follows . ( It 's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie - within - the - movie , rather than the movie . ) Yet it , too , was filmed in the late 1990s . Perhaps it IS still possible to make 1980s horror . You just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and MEAN it.(5 ) I 'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had Australian accents , but now I know . And strangely , I 'm glad I know . A need I never knew I had has been fulfilled ."	0
"A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out , but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries . In this delightful Ealing Studios comedy , Guinness is marvelous as the mild - mannered but persistent chemist . Greenwood , with her sensual voice , plays the love interest ; Parker is her harried father . Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry . While telling an engaging story , the film also raises some intriguing questions about science , the economy , and politics . It is adeptly directed by Mackendrick , who would go on to make "" The Ladykillers "" and the sublime "" Sweet Smell of Success "" later in the 1950s ."	1
"Richard Chamberlain is David Burton , a tax lawyer living in Sydney , Australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five Aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in Peter Weir 's apocalyptic 1977 thriller The Last Wave . Taking up where Picnic at Hanging Rock left off , the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and , in the process , shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions . Weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been "" domesticated "" , their tribal laws and culture no longer apply . < br />From the start , Burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and "" dream time "" evaporates . Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to Burton 's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps . As violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky , the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear . Burton and his wife Annie ( Olivia Hamnet ) study books about the Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions . When he invites one of his clients Chris Lee ( David Gulpilil ) to his home for dinner , he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by Chris and his friend Charlie ( Nadjiwarra Amagula ) , an enigmatic Aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants . As Burton 's investigation continues , his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.After Chris starts to appear in his dreams , Burton is convinced that the Aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because "" he saw too much "" , though Chris refuses to acknowledge this in court . Burton , becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he can not unravel , says to his stepfather priest , "" Why did n't you tell me there were mysteries ? "" This is a legitimate question but , according to the reverend , the Church answers all mysteries . Burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves . Though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream , he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning.In this period of history in which native Hopi and Mayan prophecies predict the "" end of history "" and the purification of man leading to the Fifth World , The Last Wave , though 25 years old , is still timely . The Aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture , not one completely subjugated by the white man , yet I am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing . Weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality , but he perpetuates the doom - orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear , showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time ."	1
While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series , the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start . Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there , the pace of The Gathering is slow , the makeup somewhat inadequate , and the plot confusing . Worse , the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems , I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .	0
"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS.I have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is . And being French , it tries for depth by being enigmatic   nothing really makes any sense.Léo is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is HIV positive . The youngest brother , Marcel , has not yet come down to breakfast , and the first thing the family does is decide that at 12 years of age he is too young to be told . Maybe if he was four or five , but twelve ? The first totally unbelievable thing is that the family does n't even ask where or how he got the virus , how long he has known about it   nothing is asked . They only worry about Marcel finding out . This is a very close knit provincial family , but although they decide not to let Marcel know about Léo 's HIV positive status nor the fact of his being gay , the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions . How many families do you know where the parents / brothers would n't have at least SOME reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay ? Here , nothing.Léo decides that he needs to go to Paris to see his ex - lover . And he decides to go on the trip with , of all people , Marcel . Do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover ? Again , totally unbelievable , especially since Marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality . If this is the way the family has decided to let him find out , it is rather brutal and again unbelievable.Léo goes to find his lover , Aymeric , at his work in a Paris bar . The owner says that Aymeric will not be there until the early evening . But why would Léo want to see him at work ? Why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk ? Why not go and see him at his home ? But no , Léo shows up later in the day ( with Marcel in tow ) and is surprised when Aymeric does n't just drop everything to go walk with him for 5 minutes . Aymeric tells him that he is no longer available , that it was Léo who left him , and that Léo had n't replied to any of his letters . Léo says "" But I love you "" and then wanders off . But if he really loved Aymeric , would n't he have at least told him about his HIV status , to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication ? This would be the least he could do  but not a peep . He leaves and does n't even warn Aymeric that he might have contracted the AIDS virus . This is totally irresponsible of him  and of the film - makers ; this film was apparently made for a French TV series for young people  it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible . Well , not here   I guess "" Every man for himself "" is still the French way of doing things   Another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the "" touchy - feely "" aspect . Everyone is always leaning against someone , caressing someone or kissing someone . Inside the family and outside the family . I have never seen anyone in France be THIS physical , never mind an entire family . Seated at the breakfast table , one 17 year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother , and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something . How many brothers do you know who are THAT physically close ? In another scene , the same 17 year old comes into Marcel 's room asking "" What 's the matter , ca n't you sleep ? "" , then takes off his clothes and , completely naked , gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers . This and another similar scene between Léo and Marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film . Sorry , again I do n't believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers.The only good thing I can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fine   especially Marcel in the main role . But it was n't really enough   HIV and AIDS are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light . At the end of the film , the family has gone to the cemetery to bury Léo , but once again , Marcel has been left out of it  he has been left in the care of a cousin ( I think ) . Nevertheless he sneaks out and watches the funeral from afar . Is this what such a close - knit family would have done ? It is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brother 's funeral . It was the last scene of the film , and it was the last straw for this viewer ."	0
"Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too , as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years . No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people , who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride . She finds Tarzan and Jane , who try to protect her . George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but is n't used to his full advantage . Also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player / singer who goes into song every so often . Even the "" great "" Robert Florey ca n't aid this one.*1/2 ( of four )"	0
"This movie was horrible , simply put . It was so bad I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers.I am a campy horror film expert , per se . I have watched "" Redneck Zombies "" , "" House of the Psychotic Women "" , "" Slumber Party Massacre II "" and many others . I know my schlock . And I know this movie sucks.Three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other . When they are not running , they are spouting non - sequitur lines , devoid of emotion or motivation . When the actors begin to be acceptable , the direction falls to pieces . There were so many jarring low - angle shots ; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod . He used what I call the "" Leif Maneuver "" several millions times : that is , zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur . Apparently the film crew could n't get up early enough to film a sunrise , so they filmed a sunset ... and played it in reverse . With direction this lazy , you are actually impressed with the final gory scene . The only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty - five minutes.If you want a good ( bad ) gory movie , rent "" Riki - Oh "" or the foundational "" Dead Alive . "" If you are a schlock buff , and are looking for a challenge , give "" Darkness "" a go.Quote o ' the movie-Vampire : It 's die time !"	0
Paul Verhoeven 's predecessor to his breakout hit ' Basic Instinct ' is a stylish and shocking neo - noir thriller . Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films , both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why . The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve ( played by Jeroen Krabbé ) ; a gay , alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes . While there , he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag ( Renée Soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him , even if it kills him.Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film , and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it . Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be , but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration , and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on . Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself , and that is one of things I like best about him . This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that does n't happen very often ! ) . I wo nt spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work ... but you 'll see what I mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version ! ) . There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I 've mentioned , but are lovely nonetheless ; a man gets eaten by lions , another one has a pipe sent through his skull , a boat is smashed in half ... lovely.The acting in The Fourth Man is n't anything to write home about , but it 's solid throughout . Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience 's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer . It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most , though , as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale . Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct , but the original fatale did it best . Paul Verhoeven 's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view , all of which help to create the mystery of the story . Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish , but he obviously has talent and it 's a shame that he does n't put it to better use . Of all the Verhoeven films I 've seen , this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across ; trust me , it 's worth the effort .	1
An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century . It 's a string of several jokes acted out . Some of them you could tell your Grandmother , some of them not , but it 's a fairly safe bet she 's heard them all before . For what it tries to be , it 's not too bad . Before you rent it , remember that it 's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation . Robin Williams has a couple of bits , but he 's interchangeable with the other players .	0
This movie started out good , i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld . Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters , and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing . All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny . Dan Cortese was amazing . I loved him in this role . His agent should show this movie to casting agents . Watch the first few scenes and then find something better , or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess . I found this in a bin at a video store . It cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price .	0
"I went to school with Jeremy Earl , that is how I heard of this movie , I do n't really know if it was in the theater 's at all . I do n't recall the name . I have seen it , it is like one of those after school specials . The acting is OK , not great . The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny . So the only comment I can give this movie is "" Eh "" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy , if I was in a movie rental place , this is one that I would walk past and after watching it I would n't recommend it to anyone past middle school age . I 've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed , the slang is overused or just outdated . Many times I think that s what makes their characters unbelievable ."	0
"Just imagine the real Hitler , who was a master of propaganda and speech , would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.Nobody would have followed him , not even a desperate , unemployed guy in the 1920s.This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself , disguised as "" true history"".I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show . Carlyle and the producers did n't get anything right with this.Why was Hitler able to win so many people , a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage ? Why did people follow him to death ? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable . This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century . Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins . < br />This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk an actor like Carlyle into this dreck ."	0
"I love Morgan Freeman . Paz Vega is an attractive , appealing and talented actress . I 'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it . Nothing does . It 's short ( less than 90 minutes ) . It was 75 minutes too long . After an hour of frustration , I scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes . Excruciating.Freeman plays an actor - who has n't worked in a while - researching a part that he might play , as a checkout clerk in a supermarket . He visits the supermarket where she works . Nothing happens . She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arby 's , a Target , a car wash . Nothing happens . They converse about their lives . Nothing happens . Ever.I do n't get it . But I also do n't get the Bill Murray flicks "" Lost In Translation "" and "" Broken Flowers "" . If you like those movies , maybe you 'll like this . Lots of people find movies like this whimsical , charming , or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialog fascinating . A common device in movies of this ilk is to have a LONG take of stillness / silence after an actor delivers a line that 's supposed to be meaningful . We know it 's meaningful because it 's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen . Sorry , I must be a philistine . I do n't get it . To me , these kinds of movies are n't funny , or charming , or thought - provoking . They 're just boring . Why ? Because there 's no comedy . No drama . No tension . No laughs . No suspense . No action . Nothing to watch . In short , none of the things I go to the movies for . I can be bored for free . I see oddball / quirky characters in real life . I go to Target , and fast - food restaurants , and car - washes . These elements do not a movie make , even if stars are doing this stuff . I pay to be entertained.If you 're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing , have fun . If you wanna drool over Paz Vega , you can look and listen to her . But nothing happens , I promise . A total snoozefest ."	0
I am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with Karas and the Tasuiev sisters , RENAISSANCE.And firstly , that it looks as it ought to look ; a boys ' adventure , RENAISSANCE is the tale of a cop 's investigation in search of a missing young scientistIlona Tasuiev , the geneticist and researcher for the Avalon company.The tale of Karas , Ilona and Bislane is , though much less known than SIN CITY , the better movie , and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs . To the French comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful ( I have enriched my French comics collection last week , though I 'm not so uptodate ) . The atmosphere , the music , the characters , their lines , the plot are all nice and endearing . A Parisian top cop , Karas , is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalgenetic research , Ilona Tasuieva mildly hot blonde , whose rebel sister Bislane was erotically preferable , I guess.For me , an oldie aficionado of comics and TV series , RENAISSANCE , a marvelously beautiful cartoon , was like a replay of a WILD WILD WEST episodehere , a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futuremore jaded and blasé but , in a sense , as thrilling . RENAISSANCE is not suspenseful ; nor does it look especially wellpaced ; but it 's seducing and hypnotic . Moreover , it achieves sketching , albeit briefly , a world , a true worldand we will think about the Avalon , Nakata , Jonas Mueller , the Tasuiev sisters , and Goran , Farfella , and Karas telling of his distant childhood in Kasbah  . I liked RENAISSANCE 's feel , of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness , and also the professional , assured look ; among these new cartoons , this one and Linklater 's Dick adaptation ( --the only and first Dick adaptation ever-- ) stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement.I thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and , when not conventional , vividly eerie ( like the invisibility costumes).As advisable , the characters have exotic names , like Bislane and Farfella , mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment 's world ( Goran and Ilona and Naghib  ) .None seems to have noticed that RENAISSANCE 's poster features a Rourke look - alikethat guy is Marv ; which does n't make it a SIN CITY rip -- off , but not a paragon of originality either , and in fact there 's more resemblance to the Miller talenamely , the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society , the brio of the hero ( in fact a cross of Willis ' character and Rourke 's persona in the previous movie  ) on the other hand , this cartoon breathes a more public air , a brim of straight adventurousness , and , in a word , it 's like SIN CITY for kidswell , naughtier kids I mean , 'cause there 's a bit of nudity on display . To what I have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic , even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult comics ' look ; true enough , and it was oldie Miller to have brought that things on screen and RENAISSANCE bears some resemblances here and there . Now it 's also fair that every RING ought to have its ERAGORN , so to each sin city , its renaissance . I admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales , a rather undemanding specialty .	1
"After watching "" The Bodyguard "" last night , I felt compelled to write a review of it.This could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera - work . It was beyond annoying . The angles were all wrong , it was impossible to see anything , especially during the fight sequences . The closeups were even horrible.The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring . He is approached by Judy Lee , who is never quite straight with Chiba . Lee 's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought , as the Mob and another gang of thugs are after her.The story was decent , and despite horrible dubbing , this could have been a good movie . Given better direction and editing , I 'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie . As it is , it 's more like another cheesy 70 's action movie.Note : The opening sequence has a quote familiar to "" Pulp Fiction "" fans , and then continues to a karate school in Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie.Rating : 4 out of 10"	0
For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stone 's comic timing is perfect . There are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie . I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes . Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing .	1
This film is another of director Tim Burton 's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his ` vision ' to the screen . He has done it with ` Batman ' , ` Sleepy Hollow ' and now this . This is not a remake . The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak ( and Charleton Heston makes a cameo ) . Burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today 's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time . During the 1960 's America was struggling to redefine its civilization . It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . In that context , POTA was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . The dialectic between Colonel Taylor ( Charleton Heston ) , Dr. Cornelius ( Roddy McDowall ) and Dr. Zira ( Kim Hunter ) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton 's version is as much a product of today 's times as POTA was of the sixties . This is Apes for Dummies . It is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . The ` surprise ' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , Burton 's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , ` I know something you do n't know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out . 'From a technical perspective , as is always the case with Burton 's film , the film is excellent . The makeup is fantastic and Burton 's camerawork is outstanding ( though I continue to dislike his dark look ) . However , thirty - three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie . The humans band together behind Captain Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg ) to fight the monstrous Apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats ( notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari ) . The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today 's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed . Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . Walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . This part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in Wahlberg 's repertoire . Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth . His is a virtuoso performance , single - handedly saving the film from total ruin . Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade . He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time . Additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimp - man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment . It is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . I rated it a 3/10 . From a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 9/10 . However the story is an insult to the original franchise . It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . Of course it 's true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .	0
"This is the second Animatrix short , and the first of them to be what one could call ' artistic ' . It contains a lot of references , metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material , especially with a running time of 9 minutes . I 've heard some complaints that this is "" anti - human "" , or tries to direct hate towards man , for their "" sins against machine "" . I do n't think that 's true ; it merely uses the robots to show us , that as humans , we are n't particularly accepting or open - minded towards anyone different from ourselves . I 'd say it does a great job of that . The plot is good ... it plays as a historical document , recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy . Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like . The voice acting is very good , if there is not a lot of it . The animation is nice , and the use of color , in spite of the usually realistic drawing style , makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery . This has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals , as well as a little nudity . The disc holds a commentary , not in English but subtitled , and worth a listen / read . There is also a well - done and informative making of , based on both parts , so I would advise watching it after seeing the next one , as well . I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe , and/or science fiction in general . 8/10"	1
"Yes , I sat through the whole thing , God knows why.It was a long afternoon , I had nothing to do , it was bitterly cold outside , okay , those are all lame excuses but they 're the only ones I have.I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films , but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom -- poor script , poor acting , bad lighting , and cheesy special effects.The storyline , which never completely makes sense , revolves around this simple little family , Daddy , Mommy , and little girl -- that I assume the viewer is supposed to be "" identifying "" with , all three of them were tedious and annoying . You just want the dark side to get every one of them.Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars . Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the "" mysterious "" Orient . Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as "" The Darkling "" . < br />During the course of the film , the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things : a shadow without a person , the inner darkness that exists in all of us , and the Devil . So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy -- because trust me , it does n't really matter.The Darkling 's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion -- it gets a human companion -- and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being . This , of course , leads to immense wealth , followed by disaster , for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long , tedious movie.<br / >"	0
We always watch American movies with their particular accents from each region ( south , west , etc ) . We have the same here . All foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture , besides American and European almost dominate the cinematographic industry.This movie tell us about a parallel world which it is n't figured even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo . All actors are improvising and they are very realistic . The camera give us an idea of their confuse world , the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world.It 's a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home .	1

"I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short "" Surviving Desire "" in high school , and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant "" Henry Fool . "" But this 10-year - later sequel is not only unnecessary , it 's disgraceful.After a choppy and expeditious start , "" Fay Grim "" devolves into pseudo - intellectualism , flat out boredom , and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism . And that 's just the plot.The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly - developed as the movie : one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself , and it 's his only spoken scene in the film!Jeff Goldblum 's Agent Fulbright , it seems , is the only bright character ( a pun surely intended by Hartley as well ) . How , then , is he left ? * * SPOILER * * Dead via a car bombing , easily making this the gentle - natured Hartley 's most violent film to date , and tonally all wrong in a film that 's already all wrong from the word go.As for the other new characters , Angus James , Ned Fool ( or is it Grim ? ) , not to mention Fay herself ... well , I wo n't spoil their fates , as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own ( when it is n't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle , which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student).This piece is a complete disaster , a dreadful mess that is n't even good - humored enough to revel in its messiness . Instead it self - indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the "" real world "" , one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say . In doing so , Hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them.I have rarely been so depressed at the movies , and I 'm counting "" Leaving Las Vegas , "" which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them , instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.Grim , indeed ."	0
"This Worldwide was the cheap man 's version of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized "" Big 3 "" Stations during the Saturday Morning / Afternoon Wrestling Craze .

I have just seen this film , and fallen in love with it . There is a little bit of something for everyone , and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil . When they are on the beach , I nearly cried ... there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together . This idea taken from several angles , from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places . The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last . Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of Lachlan . I 've always had a soft spot for the accent , but I nearly melted with his portrayal of his character . The way this film was shot is also beautiful , with the music , backdrop of the open fields , and superb acting . All together , this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .	1

A warm , sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop ( James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan ) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it . The key to this film 's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low - key , unfussy performances . As a result , you fall in love with virtually all of them.There 's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated . Loneliness is a major theme , most obviously represented in the character of the shop 's owner and manager , played wonderfully by Frank Morgan . He discovers that he 's being cuckolded by his wife , and realizes that the successful life he 's created for himself is n't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he does n't have a partner to share it . This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant , because they 're both reaching out to this unseen other , who each thinks of as a soulmate before they 've even met . Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end , but the movie does n't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality did n't live up to the fantasy.Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry . The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family , and that 's exactly how it feels to us as well.This is a wonderful , unsung romance.Grade : A+	1
"This series has its ups and occasional downs , and the latter is the case , here . There 's an agreeable amount of spatter , with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart 's weapons , but the editing film is a seriously disjointed , the film - making itself rougher than usual . At times , the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "" cub , "" who nearly gets lost early on . All in all , disappointment.That said , there 's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers . This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy , who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him ."	0
I really like this movie because in Australia , Chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time . I must say this is one of the best serious movies ever , which outlines the difference between the Hong Kong people , and mainland Chinese . It really shows that there 's discomfort between the two , but can only get better as HK are learning Mandarin . It also showed me how in mainland China the indie rock scene exists , and that Chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking ! Whoever said China is n't ready for rock music ? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb , with his clean and crisp voice , honest acting , and a total chick magnet . I recommend this movie to those who do n't know much about Asian people to cleanse themselves from the typical Western stereotypes , and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema like myself . Check it out !	1
"This movie is awful . At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you ca n't get back . The "" twist "" ending is very contrived . The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion . Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of "" No we were just tricking you . "" Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it ! "" I will forgive you if you can forgive me , "" is as upset as he gets . If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said "" No , sorry , just fooling you "" I would raise some serious hell . I do n't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching . Please save yourself and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE ."	0
"Generally , I am not a huge fan of stop - motion films and at first RUKA did n't capture my attention . However , knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet - domination era , the more I watched the film , the more I realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was . This subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement.The sad little film is done without any dialog , but it 's pretty clear what is happening . A cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot -- making it into a sculpture of a hand instead . Well , the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing . However , over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man . And , by the end , the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand , in a sign of real hypocrisy , gives the man a hero 's funeral ! < br />As I said , this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jirí Trnka to criticize his domineering government . Not surprisingly , though Czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise , the state ( i.e. , the hand ) banned this little parable . Sadly , Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co - called "" Velvet Revolution "" ."	1
"Oh man , what was Sam Mraovich thinking ? What was anyone who was involved in this "" film "" thinking ? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of "" Ben and Arthur "" : Director , writer , producer ( also EXECUTIVE producer ! ) , caster , lead star- you name it , he did it . And he ( Mraovich ) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.So what is wrong with this film ? Everything .

Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees ; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate , plus many , many more ) and plot holes to boot ( Victor calls killing Arthur "" The Final Plan "" which later changes to "" The Final Deed "" ; Arthur and the private ( intern ) detective drive the same car , blah , blah , blah ) . The "" actors "" are all very bad and are way , way over the top ; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is "" I do n't make sense ? You do n't make sense ! I make sense , that 's who makes sense ! "" ) and there so much more wrong with the "" movie "" that I ca n't write them all down.However , the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about "" Ben and Arthur "" is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic ( see his fake reviews for "" Ben & Arthur "" and obvious comments by him on YouTube . ) . Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.So , to conclude , forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- "" Ben and Arthur "" will knock them right off that title , even Paris Hilton movies look like "" The Dark Knight "" compared to the monstrosity known as "" Ben and Arthur "" ."	0
"I think Dark Angel is great ! First season was excellent , and had a good plot . With Max(Jessica Alba ) as an escaped X-5 , manticore creation , trying to adapt to a normal life , but still "" saving the world "" . And being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice.The second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first . The plot kinda disappeared , and the series lost a little of it 's charm , mostly because of all the weird "" creatures "" appearing . Do n't get me wrong the second season is good , but with a little bit to much of the "" manticores "" . However , they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 , in which I had a lot of hopes to see more of.So I really wish they could start making new episodes . And with James Cameron behind this it ca n't go wrong . So as a conclusion I would say it 's a great series , however I 'm still hoping for a third season !"	1
"Everyone has already commented on the cinematography ( good to great ) , the personalities ( larger than life ) , the structure ( chronological , with many references to surf culture through time ) . What is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance : chucking mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.I was a surfer in the 1970s . We used to watch 16 mm films at the local high schools in SoCal . I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat , putting on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night . Often , the narrator was the filmmaker himself , reading a script off sheets of paper . Sometimes , a surf band or proto - punk band would add music . I was never happier . Except for the hooting and hollering , seeing ' Riding Giants ' took me back in time.IT also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge , not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder , not keeping up with the Joneses , pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question , "" what is the purpose of life ? "" At least for those like Greg Noll , Laird Hamilton and the like , they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue : to live life solely on our own terms . Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life , but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.It was this message that really impressed me ."	1
"Ben Masters,(Kyd Thomas),""Dream Lover"",'86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer character , a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild,(Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg),""Arizona Summer"",'73 from getting beaten up and raped . Kyd takes Laura home to his pad and when he wakes up , she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . By the way , Kyd sleep in his bed and Laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . Laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura . All said and done , this is a lousy picture and I purchased the DVD for only $ 1.50 and I really got ripped OFF !"	0
I was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham . Bad dialogue , worse ( worst ) acting , lifeless all the way , and the cast knew it . The two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life , sparkle , and were captivating .	0
"The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price . I expected a "" Based on the true story "" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge - podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non - related slaughter house scenes . The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects . I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but , low and behold it only got worse . If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten . Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one ."	0
I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films , but this one in particular was extremely well written , and the solution at the end very effective . However , my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film , between Columbo and the murderer ( I apologise if I 've not remembered every detail of this exactly ) . It 's the most striking image of Columbo I 've seen : the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered , and into the room beyond , which is lit up by daylight . Columbo is sitting in a high - backed armchair facing the doorway ( and us ) , contemplating the cupboard , and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light . There 's no sound . The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him . He 's deep in meditation , puffing gently on a cigar , swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks . Then the dialogue starts . Superb .	1
Young beautiful Eva ( Hedy Lamarr ) marries an older man ( Zvonimir Rogoz ) . Unfortunately he ca n't satisfy her sexually and ignores her . Frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce . Then , one day , she 's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods . Her horse gallops off with her clothes ... and she runs after it ! She meets young and very handsome Adam ( Aribert Mog ) . They make love and she realizes this is the man she wants.ENDING SPOILER ! ! ! ! Naturally , since this was made in 1933 , she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale . END OF ENDING SPOILER!!!!This horrified people in 1933 but it 's pretty tame by today 's standards . Lamarr 's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude , it 's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such . There 's only a few minor shots of her breasts . Also when she has sex with Mog , nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm . These scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the American release . Now today they 're back in . This film would get by with a PG-13 easily now.Shock episodes aside this is just OK . It is beautifully filmed and there 's next to no dialogue . Except for the music score this could be a silent picture . Luckily all the actors are good -- Lamarr and Mog especially and they 're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them . Also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences I 've ever seen in a movie . The scenes with the sexual symbolism ( there 's quite a few of them ) are unfortunately pretty obvious today . I actually started to giggle during one!So , great direction , beautiful imagery , attractive actors , good acting all around -- but I was n't exactly bowled over by it . I found the movie slow - moving ( beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me ) , somewhat dull , obvious , static and had a negative ending . I can live with the ending but it does n't excuse the other problems I had with it . Also the final sequence is REALLY strange -- and out of place . So I admire this film more than anything else . It was well - done and I 'd recommend it but with caution . Many people seem to love this movie so I 'm in the minority . Use your own judgment .	1
"If you liked the Grinch movie ... go watch that again , because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation . Mike Myers ' Cat is probably the most annoying character to "" grace "" the screen in recent times . His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound , which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater . Not even the kids liked this one folks , and kids laugh at anything now . Save your money and go see Looney Tunes : Back in Action if you 're really looking for a fun holiday family movie ."	0
* * * * WARNING : here be spoilers * * * * Why do I waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this ? This film is an impressive collection of clichés , poor writing , worse directing , and then we have n't even got to the acting yet . < br />And of course , you can predict the whole story from beginning to end.Hero expert fights against stupid , corrupt and incompetent henchmen . One avalanche goes off , burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils . Corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money . Second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade expert 's adventurous experiment . Evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well . Troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her . Etc , etc , etc , etc , on and on it goes . < br />In fact , there 's little reason to warn for spoilers . You could probably work the whole plot out if I gave you the basic ingredients . At least , I was n't too wide off the mark most of the time , anticipating what would happen next.And then we have n't discussed the factual errors.I agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually SOME redeeming features even of a bad movie . you 'd be hard pressed to find any in this one . I suppose I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots , but that 's it.It 's been some time since a film made me groan , but this one certainly did .	0
"This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man . It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things , parts of high - tech equipment presumably ; it is n't really made very clear . The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they 're herded around outside in little yellow jackets . The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory , and talking with his crew as he does so . This is a world of relentless industrialization . It 's a relief at least to know these soulless images are n't going to be presented without a human voice , as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalter 's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry , ' Our Daily Bread . ' ' Manufactured Landscapes ' contains images of people scavenging e - waste and a town ( many towns , really ) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever , with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is . Some of these scenes , the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places , might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado . But this photographer is n't as interested in seeing people up close . His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold , neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.All this happens in China , of course , though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in Bangladesh . It is backed up by music in a New Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive . There are a good many stills of the photographer 's work -- or were some of them made by the film crew ? It is n't made clear.Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer . We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow . The irony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted , and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring . He admits himself that he takes no political stand . When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film 's cinematographer Peter Mettler , Burtynsky 's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification , and hence falsification . But he is showing us places that , if we look closely , reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.Logically , but not entirely fortunately , it is Burtynsky whose voice - overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites . Burtynsky 's "" epiphanies "" may have inspired his decades of fine work , but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we 're changing the planet irreparably ; are dependent on oil , which will run out ; that China has come into the game of massive industrialization late , and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel . The interest of ' Manufactured Landscapes ' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it . The reasons for watching it are two : to see glimpses of Burtynsky 's work and the raw materials , the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully ; and to observe scenes from the vast , awesome , daunting , and rather horrifying industrialization of modern China.Because of the limitations of the narration , the idea of the title ' Manufactured Landscapes ' feels insufficiently developed . It even seems a misnomer . New landscapes they are , but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than "" manufactured . "" ' Landscapes of Waste ' or ' Wasted Landscapes ' might be better titles . There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject ; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions ."	1
We watched this in my Women 's Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies , and I absolutely loved this movie . I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch . The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone . I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed . This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating . This is a movie I will show to my children . The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women , but this movie was more than that . It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite .	1
""" Party Girl "" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey . In fact , at times , the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allow to play herself , as she normally is in real life.The film , directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer , is a treat for Ms. Posey 's fans . Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents . This is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent Meat Market districts became . At least , there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way , if we can call it that way.Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary . It 's because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary . She is the whole picture . The rest of the cast is good ."	1
This is what the musical genre was made of . Humor , talent , romance , and action all rolled into one.Frank Sinatra was wonderful . Nothing else needs to be said . Marlon Brando , although not a singer , did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson . The fact that he could n't sing added to his character . The ladies in the film were alright , but the men in the movie definitely stole the show.It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age . It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed !	1
Maybe one of the most entertaining Ninja - movies ever made . A hard - hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion ( eehaaa ! ) .

"I only today , picked this up at the 99 cents only store today , and I still think I got ripped off . "" Dream to Believe "" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $ 1 is just too freakin ' expensive for this . This film is probably only notable for 2 things : 1 . It has a young Keanu Reeves . And 2 . It 's directed by Paul Lynch , the man who also did Promo Night . Now onto the movie . < br />It 's about a girl named Robin ( Played by Olivia D'Abo ) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father 's life . So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments , she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy ( Played by Keanu . ) Robin , when not in training , works part - time , along with her mother and stepsister , at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather . Eventually she is chosen to compete . < br />Overall , Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star , and it 's also not one of the worst movies ever , but still far from good . The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end , the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over , it fades to black , even though sound can still be heard . So this can probably be passed as a bootleg . The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie , as it 's also not in the movie itself , so the cover 's obviously photoshopped . In any case , avoid at all costs , unless you 're a Keanu fanatic . I probably wo n't be hanging to it any longer . I 'm probably gon na give it to The Cinema Snob , who 's a great YT critic btw . Hey , if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight , feel free to donate to him to keep his show running ."	0
"My God , was this the "" Run , Lola , Run "" adaptation of Persuasion ? It was horrible . Bad enough that the "" screenwriter "" ( and I use the term very loosely ) cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another , often completely out of context and to rush the story along : but Anne Elliott running from location to location in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination ! Austen must be spinning in her grave . No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion . And the actress that played Mary ? Horrors . Needless to say , if the rest of the Austen remakes are this bad , they will be turning off a new generation of watchers.If you want to see an impeccable version of this ( otherwise ) wonderful novel , get the 1995 Roger Michell directed version starring Amanda Root ( whose expressions alone can speak volumes ) and Ciaran Hinds . It is superb ."	0
I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan . I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura . I also like him in his serious movies , especially Truman Show . This one is a cross between his VERY funny side , and his serious side . He is of course VERY funny in this movie , but there are parts that are very serious , and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi - function actor.As for the rest of the cast , I was happy with Jennifer Aniston 's acting . I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God . As for Steven Carell , his limited scenes are VERY funny , especially in the anchor scene.Overall , I would have to rate this a 9 . Good acting , funny script , and some very serious situations make this a very good film .	1
....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper , Col San Fernando , etc . the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream . I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake , or Don Knotts or whomever -- he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well -- so long as they Knew ahead of time it was n't a disciplined , 19 take kind of production . Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there.He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle , Benny Hill , maybe Jerry Lewis some too . Great timing , ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades , sheer enjoyment about what he was doing . His sad little clown he played was good too -- but in a touching manner.Personally I think he 's great , having just bought a two DVD set of his shows from ' 61 or so , it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me . I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.Check this out if you are a fan or curious . He was a riot .	1
This is a smart drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980 's . John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very believable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis . This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull . If you love a good romance film , then you will love this movie .	1
"For shame , for shame that a fine actor such as Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel . The movie was not only bad , but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality . The plot , ( was there one ? ) seemed to go no where . The Russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances . I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off . A "" 1 "" for awful only because there is nothing lower . Do n't waste your time on this one , you 'll not miss anything ."	0
Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one - everyone else in the movie are also great . The Dialogue is excellent and very , very witty - and the scene where Lemmon 's character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it . Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original . I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it . And the fact the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion . These two great guys made a string of movies together , but this one is the best - no doubt .	1
"Indian Directors have it tough , They have to compete with movies like "" Laggan "" where 11 henpecked , Castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots . "" Devdas "" , a hapless , fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion , with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one 's feelings or sentiments - alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . But to make a good movie , you have to tight - rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and Dishum - Dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit "" Bollywood "" leading actor who is marginally handsome . So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words "" defending his Village "" this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar ( Narasimhan ) . Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him , meanwhile his daughter is bathing his Grandson . This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India . Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films . The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with Song&Dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies wo n't sell , a sad but true state of affairs . Faster this changes better for "" Bollywood "" . All said and done this is one good Movie ."	1
It may be the remake of 1987 Autumn 's Tale after eleven years , as the director Mabel Cheung claimed . Mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life , in which love , desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles . Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment , and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one . The director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music . The love between father and son , lovers , and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance . Mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all , instead , she tries to reproduce a true life on screen , making huge efforts of years ' working on this project and gathering information in Beijing underground pubs.Daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far . His innate dispiritedness and reticence fit the blue mood of the film perfectly .	1
"Julia ( Kristina Copeland ) travels with her husband Steven Harris ( Steven Man ) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island , an island of their own . The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island . While waiting for the boat , Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor , and when her brother Peter ( Brendan Beiser ) arrives , he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island . The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off ; however , he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage 's family , but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal . Later , the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son . The Young family does not accept the trade , and they initiate a deadly war between families.""Savage Island "" is a very low - budget movie , with a stupid screenplay , amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting . The flawed story is totally absurd , and there are many unbelievable situations . For example , how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family ? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter . Then the Young family vanishes ; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends , and nobody chases them ? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning . There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject . I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are . The good cast deserved a better material to work . My vote is four.Title ( Brazil ) : "" Ilha de Sangue "" ( "" Island of Blood "" )"	0
"So , Steve Irwin . You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs , snakes , lizards , tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles , and mud , not only daily , but with enthusiasm . He was never able to make ME want to do it , but he managed to make his wife come close.This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled , have a migraine , or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity ( currently well populated by Disney films ) . It 's too noisy . Well , Steve is too noisy . He 's just so happy all the time , and would cut right through the blasé ' teenager ( I can hear it now : "" that movie was so STUPID "" ) or the Tylenol with codeine . I 'd say his enthusiasm is catching , but if it was , I would own a room full of snakes , and that has n't happened yet . I agreed they 're beauties , but I 'm still not going to pet them.Plot was indeed predictable . Bad guys were so bad , for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore . But the movie was filled with animals , and Steve and Terri , which is why I watched it . That plot ( if you could call it that ) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck . My expectations were low and stayed that way.I was hoping , though , that there would be a bit of a sequel , where Steve and Terri ( having worked on their acting skills ) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur . I still ca n't believe we wo n't see Steve anymore . I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel , at least . I ca n't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is . Crikey !"	0
I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off , when watching it i got the chills , I even wet myself a little . When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time . Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being . Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past . This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox . He can raise my kid I 'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life .	0
Why on earth is Colin Firth in this pointless film ? Has he really been that strapped for cash?The film is n't clear on what it wants to be about , grief ? , exotic places ? , ghosts ? , a vehicle for Mr Darcy ? It 's a muddled , muddy mess.There seems to be some sort of idea that Italy must be good , in itself , and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland.There are pointless episodes on the beach , in churches , on busy roads - but what it is all about , or why anybody should care simply is n't clear.There was also a yank woman in the film . It was n't clear what here job was , but she seemed only to be there to make vapid , inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl . Was it supposed to be about paedophillia??A pretty dreadful mess , all in all . I gave it 2 rather than 1 because it does n't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film .	0
"Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world 's greatest fairy tales to the screen . They remain among the most popular animated films of all time . The first was his groundbreaking classic "" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs "" released in 1937 . The last was the then - under appreciated "" Sleeping Beauty "" which made it 's debut in 1959 . In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale : "" Cinderella "" ( 1950 ) . Of the three films , "" Cinderella "" is the one most faithful to its origins . Ironically , unlike "" Snow White "" , which for better or worse , became for many the definitive version of the story . "" Cinderella "" did not follow the same path . Although it was a hit and , like "" Snow White "" , was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes , it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved . Disney , for once , did himself proud , electing not to tamper with a classic , instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale , rather than rewriting it for the screen . The result was enchanting . < br />A combination of superb animation ( in beautifully soft Technicolor ) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day . Ilene Woods , who was a radio performer , recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material , Al Hoffman , Mack David , and Jerry Livingston . When Disney heard them , he knew he had found his Cinderella . And indeed he had . Woods heartfelt renditions of "" A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes "" , "" So This Is Love "" and "" Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale "" are perfect . Eleanor Audley , who would go on to voice Maleficent in "" Sleeping Beauty "" , masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother , while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters . Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke , and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus , Cinderella 's devoted mice . William Phipps has little dialog as the prince ( future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice ) but film ( and Disney ) veteran , Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother , and she made the best number , ( the Oscar - nominated "" Bibbidi - Bobbidi - Boo "" ) her own show - stopper . < br />Among the artists responsible for the "" look "" of the film , was Mary Blair , whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney . Her elegant French - period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie . But , most important of all ' are the believable characters -- from Cinderella , right down to Lucifer , the stepmother 's deliciously evil cat . They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story , something very difficult to create in an animated film.In conjunction with the film 's 55-year anniversary , ( and , not so coincidentally , the coming holiday season ) "" Cinderella "" has just been released on a special edition DVD . It simply has never looked better . The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated -- suffice it to say , it looks wonderful . An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added , and serves the music well . The DVD extras , now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions , are too numerous to list here , but as usual , some are directed towards children , some are slanted to adults , and the rest fall somewhere in between . But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set , because , along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches , it includes a 160-page hardback book , which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release , but much more as well . As usual for Disney , "" Cinderella "" will only be available for a limited time . So , if like me , you are a "" Cinderella "" lover , get it NOW ! This edition is truly a "" Dream Come True . """	1
DANIEL DAY - LEWIS does a remarkable job of playing Christy Brown , the artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have a productive life , dealing successfully with his handicap and becoming a respected artist and writer.The film , however , is a very difficult one to review -- or even watch . Fortunately , I had the caption feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if I saw the film in a theater . While I respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter , I ca n't say it 's the sort of film I 'd want to view more than once.Nevertheless , my attention was held by the story - telling device , a flashback framed by the present , in which we see Christy being honored for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him , who certainly gave him loving care.DANIEL DAY - LEWIS certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a therapist ( FIONA SHAW ) , much to his mother 's fear that when the love is not reciprocated his heart will be broken . There 's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to her before others and then goes into a frenzied rage after drinking too much.BRENDA FRICKER does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him , his father and a brood of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until Day - Lewis begins to have success with his work . She complements Day - Lewis ' performance as the warm - hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him.Richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film . Both Fricker and Day - Lewis won Oscars , but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent . O'Conor is Christy as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy.Summing up : Elmer Bernstein 's music is an added plus factor . Well worthwhile , but definitely not a film for everyone .	1
"I have to say I am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie . I found it to be absolutely idiotic . The mother gets "" visions "" when she touches certain things or people ? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue ... Just seemed so ridiculous . Deedee Pfieffer 's performance was awful I thought . She was very irritating . The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with.I usually love LMN and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me ."	0
Charles McDougall 's resume includes directing episodes on ' Sex and the City ' , ' Desperate Housewives ' , Queer as Folk ' , ' Big Love ' , ' The Office ' , etc . so he comes with all the credentials to make the TV film version of Meg Wolitzer 's novel SURRENDER , DOROTHY a success . And for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat.Sara ( Alexa Davalos ) a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright Adam ( Tom Everett Scott ) , Adam 's current squeeze Shawn ( Chris Pine ) , and married couple Maddy ( Lauren German ) and Peter ( Josh Hopkins ) with their infant son - to a house in the Hamptons for a summer vacation . The group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by Adam and Sara ) results in an auto accident which kills Sara . Meanwhile Sara 's mother Natalie Swedlow ( Diane Keaton ) who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting ' Surrender , Dorothy ' , is playing it up elsewhere : when she receives the phone call that Sara is dead she immediately comes to the Hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among Sara 's friends . Slowly but surely Natalie uncovers secrets about each of them , thriving on talking about Sara as though doing so would bring her to life . Natalie 's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed Sara that they all eventually come together.Diane Keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together . The screenplay has its moments for good lines , but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given . Yes , this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching .

"Yes , this movie is bad . What 's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title ! ! In the ENTIRE movie , zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE . On top of that , we 're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire . One might argue they were trying to "" tone it down "" or make it "" realistic , "" but it ends up just boring . More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR . The scenes that take place anywhere else are n't much to brag about , either . Also , there 's no clear antagonist , and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie . < br />However , I will say that for a film this low in production value , the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented ( with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere ) . < br />I'm all for independent films , but it does n't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience ( if any ) . < br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer .

"I actually had quite high hopes going into this movie , so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best . About 1/3 of the way through the film I simply had to give up , quite simply the movie is a mish - mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it 's all disconnected . I love movies that make you think , but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected.Don't think it 's David Lynch - esquire as some would have you believe , it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals . Saying it 's artsy to disguise the fact there 's no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the film . The acting was good , but that can not save lack of story . I do agree with the one comment posted previously ... "" it 's like being in some other person 's head ... while they 're on drugs , "" in other words nothing makes sense ."	0
I 've been a fan since his first album . This film is a disservice to him . The performances , except for one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are simply terrible . < br />Those by Martha Wainwright , Nick Cave , Antony , and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying . Even the one by the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of Martha Wainwright.I've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and I found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments , which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work . < br />There are many who have been able to interpret Mr. Cohen 's songs , Jennifer Warnes , KD Lang , Billy Joel , Aaron Neville , and Willie Nelson come to mind , but those people selected for this performance were just awful.Hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate his insight , talent , and intelligence.So sad	0
"I love Eddie Izzard . I think this is awesome , and the other television specials should be looked at as well .

This film lacked something I could n't put my finger on at first : charisma on the part of the leading actress . This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . I just do n't know.But could it have been the screenplay ? Just exactly who was the chef in love with ? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant , and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits , than of anybody or anything else . He never convinced me he was in love with the princess.I was disappointed in this movie . But , do n't forget it was nominated for an Oscar , so judge for yourself .	0
"I typically do n't like reality shows , particularly the ones that are profiting off of "" American Idol "" 's success . But this one I can live with.Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts , and if they like them , those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience . Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do "" Survivor "" style competitions using comedic tactics . Then one will be determined as "" Last Comic Standing . "" I do like stand up comedy , so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests . There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through . It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden , Ralphie May , and Josh Blue.My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama . At first they lived together in a house like "" Big Brother , "" but now they 've done away with that , thank God.And there are a lot of comedians I felt , were only chosen not because they 're funny , but because of race , ethnicity , attitude , sex , etc . when other comics clearly should 've beaten them out . But overall , it 's a well - made reality show , which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron ."	1
The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X - Files continues without Mulder and Scully , these would be a pretty good replacement duo .	1
"In what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy , Manuel Gomez Pereira made this film , ' Things that make life worthwhile . "" It is not an original discovery , by many voice you have ( quite off the pitch , by the way ) , but it departs somewhat from the norm in the Spanish cinema . The downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined , and while some points are not well developed , others are out of place . A day in the lives of two people close to the median age . It 's basically what the movie Gómez Pereira . Jorge ( Eduard Fernandez ) is a stationary ( parado ) one which , despite load on your back with a drama major , seems willing to see things change . Only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence . In line with Audrey Tautou of ' Long dating ' ( Jean - Pierre Jeunet , 2004 ) , Jorge says things like this to herself : "" if I find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck . "" Of course it finds it , begins to play ' Today could be a great day ' ( Hoy puede ser un gran dia)by Joan Manuel Serrat and in a few crosses on its way Hortensia ( Ana Belen).She is another woman entry age , divorced and a little lonely . Take valeriana for sleeping , organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother , said her belief in God and leads to a speed of homicidal mother . Hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior , life was going in his head driving data as "" 70 % of people fall in love only once in a lifetime "" and said although it is short of Jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a "" sadistic "" sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity . Later came a communion , a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet , the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer . ' Things that make life worthwhile ' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and , conversely , make us take the case as a comedy , focusing on things like a Chinese singing at a wedding ( which seem to be amusing in itself ) or the gait of a drunk person . The problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players , therefore we can not identify with the dramatic , and not give us a solid base comic too , leaving everything except pure joke . In the end , all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn , and ends up not doing either . And it is true that something is not seen a thousand times , is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner , but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do . Ana Belén ( which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film ) and Eduard Fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working , but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film , so in moments like the "" accident "" with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands . Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do , but that is no excuse to lower our guard . In any case , both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function . ' Things that make life worthwhile ' work only up to the modest level of entertainment . Any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled , as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that , we presume , they wanted to do , can not afford to have little moments finished successful ( beyond bad ) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh , lost drunk , compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him . Neither do much for people like Rosario Pardo , making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase "" must be screwed over , "" and songs from the soundtrack , though significant , not just fit . It is true that the film by Manuel Gomez Pereira has its hits ( some of the moments involving Jose Sacristan ) , but the whole is a anodyne Story , a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better ."	1
I saw this movie as a very young girl ( I 'm 27 now ) and it scared me witless for years . I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to ( obviously ) the violence . My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie . I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it ; 0 ) I am currently reading the book ( out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it 's a classic ) and it is really a great story . However I do n't think that it should have been made into a cartoon . Ever . Well , maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way . Gives me a little heart palpitation every time . Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids , read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content . Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I did but we are out there ; 0 )	0
STAR RATING : * * * * * Unmissable * * * * Very Good * * * Okay * * You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs < br />Stuck - up career bitch Kate ( Franka Potente ) heads to the London underground to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney . However , after a hectic working day , she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform . As she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next , however , she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.In a lot of ways , the British Film Industry is really becoming one on it 's own , especially in the horror thriller department , with films such as Creep and the successful 28 Days Later ( which this has strong echoes of in parts . ) In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do , Creep does cleverly create ( especially at the beginning ) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear . At it 's clever running time , it also ( though inadvertently , I suspect ) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high - concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through - out without really focusing too much on character development and such.Of it 's weaknesses , some scenes are a little predictable , but these do n't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way . I 'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it 's not exactly perfect , but it 's certainly very effective and serves it 's basic function very well . * * *	1
What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be . This is the type of film that I 've been looking for ages . Particularly important for me was the fantastic - looking Chicago , which I still keep thinking about . The back cover does n't do this film justice , it 's superb , and in my top-5 for sure .	1
It was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series , from one to seven . And this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain . Plus it showed some of the puppet master series that I did n't see and I what to see it so badly like part two . It showed an appearance of Torch which can turn things and humans , which is cool , and showed the return of the puppet master from part one . It also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool , it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did . So thanks to this Puppet Master is going to be a big hit .	1
This is a complete Hoax ... The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan . Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian ; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India . The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets . Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur , Rajasthan . The film - makers in their ( about the film ) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around . Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India . The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song . They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song . How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively . They are just on the band - wagon to make big on the issue . I do challenge the film makers to deny it .	0
"Vodka Lemon is a charming , yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others . Though reasonably well - crafted , the film lacks any real "" zing "" , relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art - house viewer . The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance , unfortunately , they deserve a film worthy of their genius . Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama , Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled . You may laugh , but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides . A noble effort , ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion ."	0
I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I picked this version . Everything from the acting ( the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera ) to the camera shots ( all medium or close up shots ... no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots ) were absolutely terrible . I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation . Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination .	0
' Dead Letter Office ' is a low - budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service , struggling to rebuild their damaged lives . Unfortunately , the acting is poor and the links between the characters ' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over - schematically represented . What 's most disappointing of all , however , is the portrayal is life in the office of the film 's title : there 's no mechanisation whatsoever , and it 's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living . Granted , part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure , but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s , if it ever truly existed . It 's a shame , as the film 's overall tone is poignant and wry , and there 's some promise in the scenario : but few of the details convince . Overall , it feels the work of someone who has n't actually experienced much of real life ; a student film , with a concept and an outline , but sadly little else .	0

"I guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of "" Beauty and the Beast "" , but I ca n't say I 've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex . Wow . Anyway it seems that a young woman and her .. aunt ? Have traveled to this castle in France where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner , who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off . It seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather , uh , frisky , I guess you could say , with the ladies , or at least , one in particular . There are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon - to - be - blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom 's father removes it from her sight . Anyway , the young bride - to - be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a Cardinal to show up to the wedding ( a family member , I guess ) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her . The effects in this leave a little to be desired , and any attempt at eroticism ( not that I know much about that ) is kind of rendered laughable , especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat . This has a rather strange and abrupt , yet twist ending , with not really any clues or much build up to it , but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what I expected . I do n't know , this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird . 7 out of 10 ."	1
I was surprised when I saw this film . I 'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel . How disappointed I was.How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes . The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times , but also ruin the feel of the period . As for the cast : Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine ( but then any ' hot ' American star would be questionable in the role ) , Toni Collette is miscast , and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable!I really could not say a good thing about this film . I seem to be among the very few who do n't rate it , but if you want my advice , see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me , that is far preferable to this superficial trash .	0
Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan , an average man who feels God is messing up his life . God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways . Of course , giving someone God 's powers could take a turn for the worse . Bruce Almighty is a good comedy , Jim Carrey is good , as always Morgan Freeman is first - rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well . The jokes are almost always on target , although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey 's facial expressions . I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God , not only that but also as a black man . I thought this quite well , especially with the brilliant Freeman . There are some hilarious scenes , the opening cookie scene for instance , others miss the target slightly but still a good film . 6/7 out of 10	1
This movie is possibly the cheapest , cheesiest , and poorest sequel ever made.Yet , it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney , and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish.It 's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions.*SPOILER ALERT * The first one 's all about Beast and Belle being petty over a pathetic argument . Then , three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle . Part way through this little episode , Belle has wall eyes , which made my siblings and I laugh so hard . Then , she and the Beast fight more over the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness . How old are they ? ? ? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness.Then , the next one 's all about Lumiere being the world 's biggest dope when it comes to romance . This coming from the man who could woo anything female . And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle , and winds up getting off scotch - free by the end of it . What a message to send the kids!Then , the next one 's all about Mrs. Potts being angsty . And the next one after that 's all about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird , to the point where he just seems downright silly.The animation 's so ugly , it kills . There are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see ... and the coloring is awful.Belle 's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong . Plus , she 's petty and very different from the usual Belle.And the side characters are annoying ... ( I mean , Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time . I know they did that in the movie , but it was overdone in this.)But the worst character is Mrs. Potts . She 's ruined in this . I ca n't even describe it . Just buy it and see for yourself.I give it a 1/10 for the sap , but I give it a 10/10 for comedy .	0
"Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography , I can hardly say anything positive about this movie . The single real issue is the protagonist 's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . Abundant "" emotionally powerful "" scenes do not go with this plot and , because of bad acting , they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . The director only manages to introduce Anthony 's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . The characters do not seem to evolve , although it is difficult to speak of any characters ... perhaps except for Sonny . Beside him , actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to , they come off as self - indulging amateurs . I wonder what ruined the movie more : the superficial script , throwing away all the potential of the plot , or the bad acting , disturbing any appeal that might be left ."	0
"Very low - budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park , and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm . Although released by RKO , this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution . The cast and crew , with a few exceptions -- among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord , director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner -- are comprised of complete unknowns , and it shows . The performances are universally sub - par and would n't pass muster in a high school training film , the direction is stodgy and choppy and , as mentioned previously , there 's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors . However , despite the film 's many shortcomings , it does have a few good points . The location shooting in New York City , and the film 's ultra - low budget , gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior "" The Naked City "" , a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled , and some of the investigating procedures are clever . Otherwise , it 's not much to write home about . It is worth a look , however , for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s , and old - car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of ' 30s and ' 40s cars in the streets.<br / > ."	0
Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one . Otherwise this would get an easy zero . Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen . In fact were Peckenpah 's name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it . Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered . It shows in spades . The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look . Not even Gig Young is watchable . This is a true test of masochism . Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming . And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave . What a mess , it seemed less written than made up as they went along . It 's not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards . Yikes ! ! ! ! !	0
"This series just gets worse and worse . Poorly written and just plain not funny ! The premise is excellent , but the writer 's inexperience shines through . By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , "" Oh , silly you "" style acting that comes with a no laugh script . They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , are n't we zany ? Is n't this funny ? Well , no , it 's not actually . Gum disease is less painful . No wonder , with the exception of Corner Gas , Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV . Come on CBC you 're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent .

"Lensman is a rather lesser - known Anime gem from Toho and MK studios . It 's loosely based on the novel , but it reminds me more of the game "" Metroid"".If you want to see this , see it in Japanese with Subtitles or just plain Japanese .

Les Visiteurs , the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny . I like Jean Reno as an actor , but there was more . There were unexpected twists , funny situations and of course plain absurdness , that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.Now this sequel has the same characters , the same actors in great part and the same time traveling . The plot changes a little , since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers . So they jump up and down in history , without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie . The duke , Jean Reno , tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing , but his character has been emptied , so there 's not a lot he can do to save the film.Now the duke 's slave / helper , he has really all the attention . The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be . Fact is ; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience , but he does not succeed . It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke , you already know , but he insists on telling that joke till the end , adding details , to make your suffering a little longer.If you liked Les Visiteurs , do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel . If you did n't like Les Visiteurs , you would never consider seeing the sequel . If you liked this sequel ... well , I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies .	0
I really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad ( the one when Samantha and Nick are flirting in the hotel ) . The story is so cool and ca n't wait to read the book ! Bravo for the super station !	1
First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel , Revelation , Matthew 24 , Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures . There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message . So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations . As a Christian , though an amillenialist , I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much . So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low.No , what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message , but rather its lack of production values , awful script , mediocre acting , and pitiful FX . This movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s . No , this movie ranks down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace . This movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this , but they failed . The Left Behind Series , The Apocalypse series , and the Omega Code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem , but their scripts are still poor , and their acting is wooden.There are great Christian films , with extremely low budgets , but this film is not one of them . I 'm surprised the MST3 K crew never lampooned this one .	0
Despite the title , The Sword Bearer , and the DVD cover ( action / herioc poses of The Sword Bearer ) this is not a super hero film.(Minor Spoilers ) It follows the tale of Sasha , The Sword Bearer , who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm . Cool you say , but no , this is real life . If you had this power as a child could you control it when , say , faced by a mad man , or when your mum 's boyfriend is beating her . And if you do n't control it , how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.This essentially is where Sasha is when we meet him . Wandering aimlessly after another killing ( much like A Bout de Soufflé ) . He then meet Katya , and the pair fall instantly in love , providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways . However , his past is still chasing him , in the form of two police officers.That is essentially the story , and there is virtually no action on screen , though a lot if suggested.I really like this movie . Unlike many Hollywood ' super hero ' films , we get very little back story , there is no bad guy ( unless you count The Sword Bearer himself ) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.Worth checking out if you can find it .	1
It 's great how this movie pulls you along . I had honest laughs . Do n't care that it 's low budget cause the thing works for me . To be honest my wife did n't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film . She did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string . These characters who 's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world . Just keep going and be who you are . Dreams are what you make of them . In watching this movie a second and third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through . What can I say , I like my fun with some complexity . Anyway liked it . Hope to see more .	1

"Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response most likely will be "" Who ? "" or perhaps "" Why ? "" Well , believe it or not , Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film , which is about a poor , desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for "" carfare "" to the United States . It 's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well - meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks . The movie takes place in British - dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland , all Mr. McLaglen 's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk . The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point , many others not only do not care , they do n't even know what the fuss is all about . The morale of this movie is : look out for the friend , he may sell you out for a dime ."	1
"or : It 's a bird ? It 's a plane ? No , look ... It 's a disaster ! or : No need to look up in the sky.or : ( ... OK , that 's enough . ) If singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record , he failed . The SR structure ca n't do this , the dark and restricted color scheme ( I would call it "" wishi - washi "" ) , the boring usual dialogs , the clown with advanced alien technology , the missing fun and magic , etc . makes the movie completely disappointing.It simply does n't work.The main thing at a character like superman is , that he is a superhero . That 's the core , the most important thing.Love trouble and a sadly lost depressive Supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2:40 long Superman movie , not the whole time.Because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore . It 's like a ( and in this case a very bad and boring ) social study , where every 30 minutes a person flies around.That 's a big difference.This movie is a joke . Holy skywalker , this is Superman , so give us Supervillains , Superaction and the most important thing , Superfun.We want ENTERTAINMENT ! Singer , if you want to make a 2:40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people ? Then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake.They say : Superman returns . And then , supersadlysoftie stands in the door.Maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite , but one bad movie ca n't do this . Do n't give up , they plan a sequel ... Next time singer ( and Warner Brothers ) , make a superhero movie , not a depressive superlame soap , or let it be . A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic.This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover . Yes , technically there are all sorts in , yes , there is a lot of small talks , there are a few jokes , a view action scenes , etc , but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality.It 's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my live.The ridiculous cast strategy ( Cast them young as possible , so we can make sequels in the next 25 years ) gives the rest . Kate Bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter , she 's looking like 19 . Superman was full five years away , so he slept with her 6 years ago , so she was 16 , ( looking like 13 ) and a daily planet reporter , wroting "" I spend a night with superman "" . Warner Brothers , that 's too much.Routh is not so bad , he is playing a little bit wooden , but the whole movie is wooden , so ... ? ! Temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey . The rest , forget it . Even spacey , this is not his terrain.Reeve / Hackman / Kidder were acting so easy , with fun . What a difference.The Jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too . What the hell should that be ? The problem here is , they mean this serious , not as a joke . Next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or angels ? Or they speak with god directly . Why not ? They are superheroes , saving human lives every day . So at least one talk with god every week should be possible ... Oh my god.Maybe this was not the real announced movie , instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe.For the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history . Not only because of the money.I understand how difficult it ( maybe ) was to create and transport some messages or feelings , but showing lone , lost and sadly people is n't new and thousands of movies or TV - Shows did it better , in very old or new ones like magnolia . And the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman , sorry , superman of course.Singer and WB , that 's simply nothing . In fact it 's even more than nothing , it 's like a black hole that destroys the passion for ( comic / superhero ) movies and steals us three hours of our life.Mrs . Smilla 's little brother . ( Very angry and green like the hulk . )"	0
Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie.This type of movies are actually made for flop . What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than C - grade movies . Or even some C - grade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan . The much hyped and over - confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box - office which it certainly deserved.In my view , this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films ' banner . How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick ? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi 's ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last . The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences ' hearts . In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions . I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay , but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif ' 's hand instead of Akshay . Just from the starting point I expected of it , but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . Saif is the main behind the whole adventure , while Akshay joins in the midst . In any movie , the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . And Tashan loses in this way , and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.Akshay 's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies . He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again . In between Saif did a great job in Race , and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . But he has fully developed himself in the acting field . And last but not the least about Kareena . She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean . But I myself do n't think so , instead she became slim . Yes slim ! ! ! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people ( or say , male ) . Beside them it is nice that Saif 's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young Saif . I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood , or say want to be admitted in an asylum . Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films . In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.Sorry , I do n't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .	0
This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen ! ! ! The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent . The entire story was twisted and unexpecting , which , is what made it entertaining . As good as the movie was , the entire film is judged by the ending , which was terrible ! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending .	1
I wonder how the actors acted in this movie . Annette Bening was really herself , half in and half out , was she faking or being natural ? It did n't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film . Brian Cox acted really well . I almost thought that he had always acted this way , tricky , dishonest , in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene . As for Gwyneth Paltrow , the question is what she was doing in this film.This film is quite sickening and disgusting . Who would pay to see such a crap ?	0
IN LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON ( 1917 - 2000)When I watched this movie for the first time I was 4 years old and I got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd World War . The scene , which impressed me the most , was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army . It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march . This movie is fantastic , from the trip to Portobello Road ( which became to me the most fantastic place of London ) to the journey to Naboomboo . Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple . She is always great , it seems the good aunt of a family and David with his always astonished face is her great co - protagonist . we 'll miss him a lot .	1
It is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS . The projected toll is greatest in sub - Saharan Africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . Christophe Honoré describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo , a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . Though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common -- the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close - knit family.When twenty one - year old Leo ( Pierre Mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , Tristan ( Rodolphe Pauley ) and Pierrot ( Jeremie Lippmann ) that he has AIDS , the family is devastated . Out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12-year old Marcel ( Yannis Lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . When Leo goes to Paris for treatment , he takes Marcel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth . Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting . When he brings Marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion . < br />Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances by Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . Seeing events unfold from the young boy 's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut 's The 400 Blows . Unlike some American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS , Close to Leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real .	1

This 1947 film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles ( with a funky Irish accent ) and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair . So , I 've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc . but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction . Our first meeting went well , she does a superb job playing the frightened / cagey Elsa , married to a crippled millionaire lawyer . Mike ( Welles ) and Elsa fall for each other . He wants to run away with her , she does n't know if she can live without the things money can buy . Elsa , her husband , and his partner bicker and bite , just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true . Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house . ( Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun , which borrowed heavily from this scene ) . I was n't sure who the murderer was until the end.This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon . The dish centers on the sea , it is subtle , sour , and pungent , all to great effect . These might not be the best , fresh shrimp , but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco . The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy , but filling alternative to more mundane , common fare . 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies	1
"In the autobiographical coming - of - age tale "" Romulus , My Father , "" Eric Bana , of "" Munich "" fame , plays an impoverished German émigré struggling to raise his son , Raymond ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) , in rural 1960 's Australia . The major obstacle to the family 's stability and happiness is his wife , Christina ( Franka Potente ) , who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men . Despite her highly unconventional behavior , Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce , masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him . It is , unfortunately , the good - hearted and good - natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie ( Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).Even though I admire "" Romulus , My Father "" for what it is trying to do , I ca n't honestly say I enjoyed it , for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it , these simply are n't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing , which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen . A serious slice - of - life drama is one thing , but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery , insanity and multiple suicides ( let alone attempted suicides ) is something else again ."	0
I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this irritating mess , but I just could n't do it . Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse . < br />The whole thing is just ludicrous , from the awful acting to the laughable FX to the stupid plot.Complete waste of time ; do n't bother . Root Canal therapy would be more enjoyable . Bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant . < br />Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be only a little worse than this . Get the idea ?	0
"It seems to me that Stephen King 's "" Bachman "" pen - name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer , rawer , more mean - spirited stuff that he wanted to write without ' contaminating ' his ' brand name ' . If you look back at the "" Bachman Books "" ( Running Man , The Long Walk , Roadwork , Thinner ) you notice they have a sealed - in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King . I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated , blood - covered , emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom ... but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit , and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling . Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly . ( BTW , "" Pet Semetary "" could have easily been a Bachman book if King had n't revealed the alias by then . And "" The Dark Half "" seems to be at least partially about his "" Bachman "" persona.)""Thinner "" was the last Bachman book , and man , with its themes of class warfare , revenge , and death by starvation , it is nasty . So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit . < br />What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a "" TV Movie Of the Week "" level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release . ( These days , something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable ) . The makeup work and the striking motif ( starving to death in the midst of plenty , a metaphor for the overfed , undernourished American middle class if there ever was one ) is all that keeps you watching this misfire . < br />What went wrong ? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe , but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here ( with the exception of Joe Monetegna ) simply ca n't carry the movie . And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure . Plus he could n't leave the plot alone , and his changes do n't really help . The script and dialog ought to work , but mostly the movie just lies there . Everything is muffled , dull , airless , and no fun to watch ... with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting .... thinner , and thinner , and thinner . < br />As other have pointed out , "" Thinner "" is by no means the worst King movie ever made ( or even the second worst ) . And it does have a dreadful , compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work . But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations ."	0
"Yes , definitely better than my viewing of Death Tunnel . Actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent . It was kind of like Wrong Turn meets the Hills Have Eyes.BUT : 1 . ) When the "" kids "" ( high school or college ? ) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen , everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream ( 1996 ) . The thing about the big - breasted girls etc.2 . ) Was Steve NOT a bootleg Randy from Scream ? 3 . ) Besides the fact that it took place in October , what the hell did the movie have to do with Samhain ? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me . I find it humorous when I see those horror movies from the 80 's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram.4 . ) Wow they made a Sam Raimi reference ! ! ! 5 . ) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie ? They 're characters had nothing to do with anything . And he s so psychic that he could n't even see his OWN death ? 6 . ) When Gary was being killed in the bathroom ( at that point , the deaths became simply Troma - licious ) how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door ? 7 . ) Gary 's sister commented on Haggis- that s primarily a Scottish dish , not Irish.8 . ) So the lesson is if you ARE like Shae and do n't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film , you 'll be the one to live ? 9 . ) The mutants were pretty cool , but they looked like walking dishes of Chili con carne.10 . ) When they brought in Gary 's sister , did they forget that Steve HAD been strapped there and wonder where he went ? 11 . ) Was there not more than one killer ? Shae beat that one , but never encountered any more of them.12 . ) What was with the flashbacks to those other people ? Half of them Shae did n't know if they were dead or alive , so what was with that ? 13 . ) Why did n't they kill Gary and his sister before ? 14 . ) Why did no one ever call the police ? And apparently everybody KNEW those people lived in the woods , why did they never organize some kind of raid ? 15.)As far as I know , they were not zombies OR vampires- so how could she "" turn into "" one at the end ? I 'm with everyone else on the giant "" huh ? "" at the end.Way better than death tunnel , but still quite sloppy . I still do n't understand why they even placed it IN Ireland , considering Samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot ."	0
"' P ' ( or Club - P ) should really be called ' L ' for lame . Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much - hyped logline : "" Thai lesbians fighting monsters . "" Rather , this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who 's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd ( but specific ) rules : "" do n't walk under a clothesline , "" "" do n't eat raw meat , "" and "" do n't accept money for your powers . "" Well , guess what folks , the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a ' bar - girl ' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the ' foreign johns ' who pay for her services.While this film ca n't even be released in Thailand due to it 's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho - hum horror pic a cross between "" Showgirls "" and "" Interview with the Vampire "" as directed by Walt Disney.If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre - teens only . There is literally broadcast TV adult fare , although you 'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life.As for the ' lesbian ' angle , there 's one brief smooch and a couple of "" I love you 's "" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple ( on brother ) . And the P - bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts ( there 's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl 's mouth ... ooh , phallic imagery).NO nudity , NO real monster ( unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes ) , and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD . You 've been warned !"	0
East Palace , West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective , with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop , and William Windom is the boy . It 's a progressive film for China , I guess , but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles . The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . He cruises the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer . And that in fact happens . Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to squat for a period of time , handcuffed , slapped . This is what the gay man wants , and , implicitly , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . The story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes unbearable . It becomes a cry of pity for China 's gays , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society . Sorry , I ca n't relate .	0
"Stylishly directed , picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted  Crosby 's interpretation seems exactly right , Hardwicke has his best role ever , while Bendix is a treat too  this Yankee 's appeal is universal and irresistible.One of the principal joys of the movie , of course , are the songs . As might be expected , Bing is in fine voice . And although Hardwicke 's solo has been cut , we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number , "" Busy Doing Nothing "" . It 's also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming , who , although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer , was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema . She has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget , using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible . ( Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived , but who 's complaining ? ) < br />In short , as the trailer actually describes , an entertainment delight from start to finish ."	1
Not only does this film have one of the great movie titles , it sports the third teaming of 70s child actors Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards . I seem to remember this film being broadcast Halloween week back in ' 78 going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House . I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film . Later , on repeat , I saw I made the right choice . The movie is not really bad , but , really lacks any chills or surprises . Although , I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail .	1
"This "" clever "" film was originally a Japanese film . And while I assume that original film was pretty bad , it was made a good bit worse when American - International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American - made segments to fool the audience . Now unless your audience is made of total idiots , it becomes painfully obvious that this was done -- and done with little finesse or care about the final product . The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different . Plus , the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera -- the evil flying turtle ! And although this is a fire - breathing , flying and destructive monster , there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film -- in particular , film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker . They both just looked tired and ill - at - ease for being there.Now as for the monster , it 's not quite the standard Godzilla - like creature . Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious . On the other hand , the crappy model planes , destructible balsa buildings and power plant are , as usual , in this film and come as no surprise . Plus an odd Japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non - Japanese audience members , and that is the "" adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him "" . Yeah , right . Well , just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films , you 've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster , though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla , Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot ! Silly , exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year - old , bad acting , meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film . Oddly , while most will surely hate this film ( and that stupid kid ) , there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa . Do n't believe them -- this IS a terrible film!FYI -- Apparently due to his terrific stage presence , Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations . None of these change the central fact that he is a fire - breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really , really lame ."	0
After we counted the use of the f word , oh , about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film , listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse , and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together , well , we turned it off . Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie , the product of unimaginative and no - talent writers . < br />We did give it a second chance , thinking surely it would get better . No dice . Later , my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved , still no dice.The main character did have a cool bike.I would n't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents , or frat boys .	0
Amelia and Michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other . Amelia has a long - time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute that does n't satisfy him . The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.There 's not a whole lot to this particular short . The direction is straight - forward and dramatic , which is good , the acting is sincere , but the story leaves a little bit to be desired . Why , exactly , do we care about these two people ? It 's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it 's much more pared down and does n't search for meaning in it ( a welcoming change of pace if anything).I do n't know , it 's possible I do n't connect to these stories because I 've never experienced them . But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same , i.e. , a couple talking together while avoiding eye - contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines , etc . The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different , and I 'd like to see a different take.--PolarisDiB	0
I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel ( especially a beloved one , like Evening ) but when I saw that the book 's author , Susan Minot , was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film , I thought that Evening would be a good adaptation.If you enjoyed the book , do n't bother with this movie . It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.Here , our characters are completely different : the bride is in love with Harris . Harris is the son of the housekeeper . Buddy is a drunk , in love with Ann and/or Harris . I do n't think a single character made it from the book to the screen ; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.And , really , did n't we learn from Bridges of Madison County that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in , to scenes of our heroes ' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights , simply does not work on film ? This film is a disaster . Skip it .	0
And so the great rewriting of history continues Hollywood style.This was senseless ridiculous rubbish.Its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived , poorly acted inaccurate film I have ever seen . It is appalling.Nic Cage 's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over . I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films.Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no fluke , she really ca n't act.Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe.Only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that America invented the world .	0
slow , incomprehensible , boring . Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book . This is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book . The best part of the movie was the scenery , excellent . The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances . The editing is abrupt and patchy . However , despite this , the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script . It was startling that although set in Peru there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering about the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century . If you have any sense of history , try to avoid this movie .	0
"A patient escapes from a mental hospital , killing one of his keepers and then a University professor after he makes his way to the local college . Next semester , the late prof 's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings . The dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes . This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the ' 80 's . Despite killing the heroine off , this is just substandard junk . Horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , horrible horrible horrible ! ! "" Splatter University "" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do , although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape , that would be more entertaining . Skip it and rent "" Girl 's Nite Out "" instead.Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence , Profanity , Brief Nudity and Sexual Situations ."	0
For a long time it seemed like all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and ( I guessed ) all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies.This film was a real surprise : despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces , the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we , the viewer , got back was almost true suspension of belief . When the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police , you almost believed it was possible.If you are a fan of some of the better sex farces ( Canadian or not ) you should definitely seek this one out . And the big surprise , this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .	1
"Director / star Clint Eastwood 's "" Sudden Impact "" is an intriguing addition to the "" Dirty Harry "" series - a combination of crude film - making and genius . It 's mediocre and silly in parts , brilliant and classic in others , with compelling , gripping pacing . There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up "" Make my day "" scene recalls the "" Do you feel lucky "" one , one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film 's Scorpio , an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry 's partner - just to name a few.Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher - ups in the department , still mean , still tough , but now he 's older and wearier . His constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice , the two things not always being compatible . This "" incompatibility "" is the underlying theme of the series . The first film posed a simple question , "" What about the victim 's rights ? "" - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ? Vice versa ? Depends ? ) . That film 's answer was controversial , prompting a sequel ( the highly enjoyable "" Magnum Force "" ) which set out to draw the line between Harry 's brand of justice and pure , heartless vigilantism . Dirty Harry , like many of Clint 's other roles , is the personification of vengeance , the protector of the the defenseless . This movie however brings it back to the victim , in this case Jennifer ( portrayed by Sondra Locke ) , who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now - incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men ( and one woman ) who committed the crime.Without going into a play - by - play of the whole movie , I will say this - I mentioned earlier that "" Sudden Impact "" echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in - jokes from the whole series ( the confusion concerning the captain 's last name is an example - an intentional prank , I believe ) . The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul - mate in this lady vigilante ? And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister 's tarnished rights ? The exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series , one which I personally ( as a fan ) found quite moving . That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax to the "" Dirty Harry "" collection , the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film . ( Not to knock "" The Dead Pool "" - that excellent movie was a relatively light - hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan , rather than a character - defining film like this one).This movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing , and the President himself frequently quoted "" Go ahead , make my day .

"The Eternal Jew ( Der Ewige Jude ) does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document : rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says , it simply says , without opposition , what it wants us to believe ( one will concede that American newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience , often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage ) . Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was "" preaching to the converted , "" not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already , in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed . The weakest link in the film 's logic shows in its "" rat "" analogy , wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats , and then adds something to the effect of "" Well , Jewish people are like that too . "" Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles ; the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad . The film appears to contradict itself a few times , for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as light - skinned Europeans ; thereby the text admits that so - called "" Hebrew "" ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture . It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roach - infested filth , despite the supposed treasure they 've hoarded , and then flip - flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto . Incidentally , who would n't ? The use of scenes from a well - known American film , House of Rothschild , shows an equally blurry deployment of logic . First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews ; then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews ( the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews , shown as a means of avoiding taxation , although the Rothschild character 's "" spin "" is that Jews are taxed excessively ) ; finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account . This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings , but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching . For all of Eternal Jew 's imperfections , I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is , just shy of a "" 5 "" to date . I 'd say the reason is that EJ 's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose , offering us , unintentionally , a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence . Needless to say the film 's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad , or simply evil , filmmaking as a propagandist 's tool . About this time I should expect director Hippler to flip - flop once again , springing forward to say "" That 's what I meant to do all along ! "" The scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome , and show same as decidedly inhumane , contrary to the intent of Kosher law to prevent animal suffering . I would like for someone who has seen the film , and has some knowledge of these procedures , to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate ."	0
"You think you 've had it tough ? You should check out this film . Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination . What this man had to go through to become a navy diver , should be an inspiration to us all . And significantly , after seeing this film , I learned that what is shown is not even the half of it ! Cuba Gooding , Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear . De Niro , as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him . George Tillman in only his second major feature ( after "" Soul Food "" ) , has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker . If you want to be moved and inspired , you definitely need to check out this one ."	1
Carol , the young girl at the center of the story , is transplanted to a foreign land , Spain , at the height of the Civil War conflict in the late 30s . For this girl , everything is new , in it 's foreignness . The war and her father are her constant worries , while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York.Imanol Uribe directs this film by the numbers . Carol 's family is obviously divided , while Carol 's mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction , the rest of the family 's sympathies are with the Franco and the fascists that won the conflict.The story adds nothing to what has already been told , much better , but it 's an easy film to watch . Northern Spain 's magnificent landscape is shown . Do n't expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around Carol and the young boys she befriends.Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence . Maria Barranco is Carol 's mother Aurora , the one that went away to America . Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja , the teacher who befriends Carol . Carmelo Gomez , plays Alfonso , the man that Aurora left behind when she left for America . This actor , who usually has lead roles in most Spanish films , does n't have anything to do , as he remains an enigma throughout the movie .	1
A major disappointment . This was one of the best UK crime drama / detective shows from the 90 's which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotland 's Robbie Coltrane . However this one - off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus . Coltrane is n't really given much to do , much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer , and in what he has to act in , he seems uninvolved , almost bored . The ex - soldier 's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltrane 's family life seems lightweight . Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two - hour show they would have written this with much more depth . As is , skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90 's which is far far superior .	0
I am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled . Ity only lasted one year . I just recently started watching it and I love it . Its a show that could of gone as far as Friends went . It had the humour and was extremely enjoyable.It is about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without their parents . Kurt(Joey Lawrence ) plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly role.This should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic . Amazing show with all the best actors.10/10	1
The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute 's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister / friend . There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken , but they are not fully explored . The core of the movie is the funeral , wake , and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable . Apparently , the movie is unedited . The prostitute 's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud . Maybe that 's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape . The village itself , such as it is , is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male , the consort of the dead girl . Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible . Most of the film is shot with a hand - held camera that could induce nausea . Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do n't include the songs and laments of the crones . Do n't go to this movie unless you 're fluent in Russian .	0
I have to say , from the beginning , when i watched the Stargate movie movie i was n't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie , with a lot of POTENTIAL , though the movie was n't as , erm , amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens , which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing , even though i 'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people , i do n't remember one line from either of those movies , i 'm not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts , in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you , ah getting slightly off the point here , well my point is that the that you do n't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series , which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end , in 2006.though i did n't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 , and let me tell you , the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series , the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects , were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today . I have to admit that I would never have gone into Sci fi if it was n't for stargate , and my dad , who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 , and i 'm glad he did , other wise i would n't have seen the brilliant shows like SG1 , which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies , basically if a new sci fi series is n't better or as good as SG1 , its not worth watching . basically this is the best sci fi show to date , and if you do n't watch this , then you have no idea what you are missing !	1
"Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it 's on the DPP ' Video Nasty ' list , but it really need n't have been . Many films on the list where there for God ( and DPP ) only known reasons , and while this is n't the tamest of the bunch ; there is n't a lot here that warrants banning ... which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it 's on ' the shopping list ' . The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle . A hunter is then hired to find her , but along the way he has to brave the natives , lead by a man who calls himself "" The Devil "" ( hence the title ) . The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really are n't many scenes of interest . It 's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent ; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z , Venus in Furs , Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy , but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap . I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I 've seen everything on the DPP 's list ( just two more to go ! ) , and I 'm guessing that 's why most other people who have seen it , saw it . But if you 're not on the lookout for Nasties ; there really is no reason to bother with this one ."	0
"The movie shocked me . Personally i had herd mostly bad buzz . Well finally after owning the DVD for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night . though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes . The best thing about the movie is it 's consistency with the relationship . There were no ex 's popping up or characters threatening the relationship . I mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate , they date , something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie . but this movie did not follow that mold . We actually experienced the relationship and it 's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti - love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again . i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies . The story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times . And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also . It 's no "" My fair lady "" but it is a spirited and honest film . I 'll simply say i like it ."	1

"I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a "" spoof "" . Crispin Glover is very serious about his film . He personally introduced the film at the screening I saw in Chicago . He had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy . "" What is it ? "" is Crispin Glover 's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog , Lynch etc.I had heard rumor of this film years ago "" epic porno movie with all down - syndrome cast directed by crispin glover "" . When it finally came out i watched the trailer on - line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation . ... I went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment . If he took out the goofy sh*t , such as the pot - smoking grandma , and the dancing dolls , he would be left with something much better , but only about 10 minutes long.In other words just watch the trailer , be entertained , and leave it at that . There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases , but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment ."	0
I 'm watching this on the Sci - Fi channel right now . It 's so horrible I ca n't stop watching it ! I 'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad . I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie . Some of the camera work is good . Most is very questionable . There are a few decent actors in the flick . Too bad they 're surrounded by what must have been the director 's relatives . That 's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie ! Music was a little better than the acting . If you get around to watching this I hope it 's because there was absolutely NO other option ! The sequel ( yes sequel ) is coming on now .... I think I 'll skip it ! Jason	0
I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . This happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television . The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks , I started to get interesting . When he said his main influence was The Station Agent , a movie I 'd seen on DVD a week prior , I decided I had to go and check it out . The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . As far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .	1
"As a fan of author John le Carre I 've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them . I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre 's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect . I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries , a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama.Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym , the perfect spy of the title . Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre 's strong main characters , Pym is also quite possibly the best . Egan plays Pym ( who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre ) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming "" a perfect spy "" . Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run , if not from others then from himself . Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone.Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast . Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym 's con man father Rick who ( as le Carre has said ) is based strongly on the author 's own father . McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym 's life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming "" a perfect spy "" . In fact if it was n't for McAnally 's performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career.The rest of the supporting is excellent as well . From Caroline John as Pym 's mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to Rüdiger Weigang as the young Pym 's friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym 's wife the supporting cast is fantastic . Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym ( Jonathan Haley , Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor ) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan.The production values of the miniseries are strong as well . As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy and Smiley 's People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format . The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards . The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries . Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently . The novel was largely ( at least in its early parts ) autobiographical in that Pym 's early life echoed much of John le Carre 's life . The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to "" a perfect spy "" . Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage . If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight , fist fight , or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof . While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it.Though it might be overlong for some for those who do n't have very short attention spans here is a must see . From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see . It is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War yet it is more then that . It is also a trip down what John le Carre has called "" the secret path "" : the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive . As much a human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy is n't to be missed ."	1
Flat , ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account . Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey , married to the doting Andy ( Bill Pullman ) . When an old school friend of Andy 's named Jed Hill ( Alec Baldwin ) turns up as the resident surgeon , trouble is not far behind him.Script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective , tantalising thriller , and the severe lack of character motivation , background and development leaves the whole show reaching . None of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters , especially Bill Pullman , whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe.Poor director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project , and is unable to make entertainment from any of it . By the time the ' secret ' of the plot is revealed , you just wo n't care.At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good . Also stars George C. Scott , Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.Sunday , February 25 , 1996 - T.V.	0
The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film , but I was truly disappointed . They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over , which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in , although Beau Bridges , as Nick , did have a moment or two . If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . It was an embarrassment . I had been a fan since his Waltons days , but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work , so poor was this offering.In defence of the actors , the directing was stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish.I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film . However I would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back , even though it was on T.V.	0
"Gday Mates ! just watched Croc Hunter the movie . it was alright but the show seems more real . this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters .

There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie . when Terry find that baby joey she goes like "" We have to nurture them , just like a baby "" .

"Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . Actors of stature - Robert Duvall , Robert Downey , Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere ; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee - stained camera lens ; a writer ( John Grisham ) who has never produced anything of merit , discovers new depths of under - motivated incoherence . The film has a cheap , lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic . Normally , I come on to the IMDb to write balanced , generally appreciative comments . This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless , bilious rant . I wo n't , but only because I no longer want to occupy my "" mind "" with this trash ."	0
"This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970 's , usually on the "" 4 am Movie "" or one time , on the 7:30 PM "" Channel 6 Big Movie "" and still another on Creature Double Feature . WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time ) It was of the time . A couple of low - rent Abbott and Costello wannabees(Frankie Ray and Robert Ball ) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders ) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation , and wind up encountering extraterrestrials . They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN , and encounter the remains of a dead "" carrot monster "" . Later , in the cave they 're chased by a living carrot creature - basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head , with sparkly things on it and ping - pong ball eyes . Two of them - complete geeks , Ray and Ball - are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being "" examined "" by space amazons - Dr Poona(nooo kidding ! ) and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini "" uniforms "" . We were too young at the time , to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this "" examination "" scene would more than suggest . Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster , are stranded on earth with a ship that 's well hidden and are trying to return to their world.The film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when Eric Von Zipper and his crew from Frankie and Annette 's films , were the height of B - film , drive - in comedy . So it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.For some reason I only thought I 'd imagined seeing this film to start with . No , I really saw it . And when it was released on "" restored "" DVD I was assured in my memory . The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid , but whatever . The budget is non - existent , which , is a minor miracle when you think about it , that it even got made and we can talk about a "" restored "" version here and now - over 40 years later . The payoff is the girls who want to learn about "" love "" and "" kissing "" and , the upshot is the geeks - which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out .

"I really like this show . I can readily see how it achieved cult status . It 's original , and thought provoking . For some reason though , I have never felt the kind of resonance from it that I could have . It does n't pack the kind of open door , winter chill that was to be had from such an awesome premise . Each time I watch an episode , I find myself prodding , and pushing for it to answer some nameless , formless question.Before continuing , let me preface this by saying that what follows is my opinion , and my opinion only . Different strokes for different folks.I would have liked to have seen more scenes in "" American Gothic "" that were shot at night . There 's too much daylight in this show , and I think it had a tendency to counteract the suspense . We 're not afraid of the daylight , after all . We 're concerned about what 's in the shadows . The devil is n't always in the details . What we 're not seeing is often the most frightening.Second -- and this is the one that 's probably going to lead to tar , and feathers : Gary Cole is a tremendously talented actor ... a character actor . I 've followed his career from The Brady Bunch films on , which is why it pains me to say that he was probably miscast as Lucas Buck . He 's almost too petroichan , too likable to be embodiment of evil , even by Biblical standards . Lucas Buck is a narcotic . He 's Heroin . He 's freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of Drain - O. You keep going back , even though you know the end will be madness , and death . He should be like the ultimate loan shark . He 's a maker of book , but also of unspeakable condemnation . Sure . You 've got the money , and before long you 're also going to have broken fingers ; a severed hand , a decapitated head , and eventually , a damned soul . Turning to Buck is an act of desperation , and whenever he 's around , there should be some immediate , ambient finality -- with interest compounded daily -- in the air.It 's all largess , all strings attached , and by the time you realize that , you 'll also know that it 's too late.Which leads me to three : they showed Buck a little too often . He 's in most of the scenes , in fact , which may have caused him to lose his edge . The sheriff would be like the next door mythology . He 's the apocryphal acquaintance . Many would know ' of ' him , but only an unfortunate few would really know him . He 'd be the stuff of flashbacks , and cryptic conversations , and the perfect person to deliver this plot exposition would have been the deputy character that Nick Searcy portrayed.Four , the show could be very self - reverential -- to a fault , some might say -- and this is typified by the whistling of "" Meet Me At The Fishing Hole "" in the series pilot . I think we 've already established that what Cassidy , and Raimi were shooting for was the anti - Andy Taylor . We probably did n't need the concept delivered to us via Fed Ex . I gathered that within the first five minutes so , for me , the piano on the head was unnecessary.These remarks are all about what , FOR ME , would have made a good show great . I also understand that the producers had their own , unique style , and that there were many hands in the soup . In their everlasting quest for LCD programming , the network played a definite role in the demise of this series.The least these jerk - off suits could have done was to air the episodes in order.Get real.Either way , it 's a grievous loss to both genre fans , and casual viewers alike ."	1
I really love this movie . I remember one time when I was in 2nd > grade , my teacher showed it to us on a 16 mm film reel . This movie , however , can be a little frightening for 2nd graders such as the scene where Bill murders Nancy and seeing Fagin 's face for the first time on the screen . One of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class . If I were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film , I would give them an A+ .	1
I 'm gon na tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this . However , the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies . It 's definitely something that most people will not get , as is the nature of absurdism.the animation is horrible , but yes , that 's the point . The main character is foul mouthed , violent , and stupid . no redeeming qualities whatsoever . his wife shrieks and wails , apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills . most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.but again , that 's the point ; ) < br />If non sequiters , foul language , and complete and utter randomness are your thing , you 're going to love this.It is really short , so I would probably rent instead of buying .	1
"I once used Wesley Snipes ' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new , untried film in which he appears . So now , for the first time , my Snipes - Method of film recommendation has failed . Utterly . I should first have come here to see these reviews.Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in "" The Contractor"".One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition . I feared that the shaky , blurry , pseudo - documentary , "" unconsidered "" directing and editing style ( first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass - directed "" Bloody Sunday "" ) might propagate to other films . Greengass ' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films . My fear had come to pass . In my opinion , these films are made really bad by these motion - sickness - inducing methods , which mistake blurry swipes for "" action - enhancement "" . But the "" Bourne Franchise , "" as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow , apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast , big bucks.Read my lips , you Hollywood types . Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented , not merely hinted at by poor , lazy cinematographic techniques.And "" The Contractor "" goes so far as to emulate "" The Bourne Ultimatum "" in inanely - repeated sound bites , in hopes their juvenile ( apparently - evaluated ) audiences ca n't sense them . For example , if I hear a cop radio crackling "" Yankee - Romeo "" one more time , I 'll just scream . The chances are good I wo n't hear it again : I certainly wo n't ever view "" The Contractor "" again.I recommend to those of you who have yet to see "" The Contractor "" : just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.2 out of 10 ; I am tempted to lower that to a 1 ."	0
This adaptation of M.R. James 's short story ' A View From A Hill ' was first shown on British television in 2005 , on the little watched digital channel BBC 4 . I saw that it was being repeated again on BBC 4 , and decided to give it a go , remembering the BBC 's successful 1970 's adaptations of other M.R. James stories including ' Whistle And I 'll Come To You My Lad ' and ' The Signalman ' . Though not in the same class as these masterpieces , ' A View From A Hill ' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama.A historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts . Whilst out in the countryside , he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years . But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill ? And what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation ? Whilst not scary in any way , I enjoyed this little production , and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation . As it is , it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome.I give it 7 out of 10 .	1
"I really ca n't remember who recommended this , but they said it was one of their favorite films . It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction , and the truth here is something to see . I really ca n't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year . How can you improve on this ? The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton 's . In the process they become recluses and what is best described as "" crazy cat ladies . "" They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie . This film was done after that rescue . All during , you could n't help but think , "" how bad was it before ? "" It 's a look at high society from the darker side , and it is utterly fascinating ."	1
"And that 's why historic / biographic movies are so important to all of us , moreover when they are so well done , like this one!Before I saw "" The Young Victoria "" , I knew a few things about Queen Victoria , but in the end I got much more knowledge about it . < br />Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as Victoria ( Who would guess that ! ) and She probably will get a nomination at this years Oscar 's . Personally , I 'm cheering for her ... For technical issues , I am pleased to say that is a very successful production , with wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and , of course , like It was expected to be , a terrific periodic Costume Design ! < br />The one drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen , but foremost , incredible woman and mother ! < br />BRAVO : 9 out of 10 !"	1
Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie . Now , imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . Now imagine something 50 times worse.Got that?Ok , now go see The Underground Comedy Movie . That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . UCM is the single worst movie I 've ever seen . There were a few cheap laughs ... very few . But it was lame . Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame , it was too lame to be funny.The only reason I 'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it . He wasted his money . Vince Offer has n't written or directed anything else and it 's not surprise why .	0
"Poor Whoopi Goldberg . Imagine her at a friend 's dinner party , and she adds a comment to the in - depth political discussion going on . People just look at her and say , "" Oh what would YOU know , you were the star of ' Theodore Rex ' "" . How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap ? Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing . It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of ' Sigmund And The Sea Monsters ' . Actually , come to think of it , ' Sigmund ' was vastly superior to this.And however did it get made ? By plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it ? Watch this hideous abomination at your own peril ."	0
"I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders ( I usually DirecTivo it , but not last night ) . Woke up at 3 am ( invesment banker on the west coast ) , and was fascinated to see this on HBO2 . I was shocked on how poor this ' movie ' was . Seriously . shocked . So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB . This is really really bad . the writing is boring , but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.Yes it is shot video . Mind you , that is shot on VIDEO , not DIGITAL VIDEO . It does look like a soap opera . The clips from skateboard videos have a more ' film ' feel to them then this horror.I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly ca nt remember anything . The shots and blocking are stupid . yes , i chose the word ' stupid ' . not unconventional , not daring , not bold , not boring , just stupid . I know people reviewing this review will say "" well give me an example "" . I ca nt . It was 3 am . but trust me , I know you will watch it anyway , you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.<br / >"	0
""" Piece is Cake "" is defeatist , revisionist history of the worst kind , whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the ( admittedly fictional ) pilots it portrays . It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.In the March 1989 "" Aeroplane Monthly "" , Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini - series . A few of his comments are worth repeating:""There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action , and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in ' Piece of Cake ' . It would not have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club , though with more discipline . Nor was there any sense of ' death or glory ' . RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country , and now we were required to do it - no more and no less.""There was no discussion of ' bravery ' or ' cowardice ' . People either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did . But we knew fear , recognised it in ourselves and in each other , did our damnedness to control it , and then got on with the job ... "" ... I could feel no ' glory ' , but there was a sense of greatness , and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to ' Piece of Cake' . ""Beamont was , in his own words , "" a fighter pilot who , unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series , was there at the time"".Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB , before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest , and a post - war test pilot.""Piece of Cake "" is an absolute , total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time . It is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace ..."	0
"Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee ( a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson ) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent , yet dull businessman Thierry Martin ( a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold ) . Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage ) . Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged ? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed ? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera - style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences ; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third . The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar ( sample line : "" I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive "" ) . Better still , this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity ( the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff ) and sizzling semi - pornographic soft - core sex scenes ( Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight ) . The tart'n'tangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings . With his long , scruffy black hair , greasy mustache , foul mouth , and coarse manners , Cage 's Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing "" romantic "" lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid . The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity : Anderson , Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts , with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee 's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri , Viveca Lindfors as Theirry 's wise , perceptive mother Tatta , Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack , and Steve Buscemi as a funny , blithely shameless thief . Walt Lloyd 's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look . The flavorsome , harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot . A delightfully campy and seamy riot ."	1
I saw this when it first came to video , my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time ... What stood out for me was the lack of mid - movie conflict that so many movies have , where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do n't say the one thing that you 're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal , that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . This is what I like the most about the movie I guess , that the main characters do n't do mean things to each other halfway through ... they do n't break up and make up , they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track , they 're not that different . Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family , and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . Anyway , I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again ... sure there 's plot holes if you analyze the script and no , Woog and Dweeb should n't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now , what detracts from the film is it 's unexpected scariness . Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes . And , the addition of him halfway through the movie ( though it 's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance ) is too abrupt ... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie , perhaps to show that it 's not that scary without the the dinosaurs . I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie , so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience , who I 'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues ... I think I 'll give it a pass on those factors too , and just enjoy the story . It 's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind ... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think .	1
If I could i would give ZERO stars for this one , but unfortunately i have to give one ... There is no single scene I could laugh about ... but the game did n't make me laugh either . So if you 're some ill retarded folk , go to your local cinema , watch this movie and give it 10 stars , like some people here already did.but for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time i wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last!0/10 ... i 'm ashamed of being from the same country as Uwe Boll!PLEASE PLEASE KEEP HIM FROM MAKING MORE MOVIES ! ! ! ! !	0
I really liked this movie ... it was cute . I enjoyed it , but if you did n't , that is your fault . Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew , even though she is n't quite like the books . The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times , but she looks good on them . To me , the rich girls did n't have outfits that made them look rich . I mean , it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together . All of the outfits were tacky , especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits . I do not want to make the movie look bad , because it definitely was n't ! Just go to the theater and watch it ! ! ! You will enjoy it !	1
"I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD . The acting throughout is excellent - no question . There was not quite enough action for me I must say . No real suspense as such , just plenty of first class character development . Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "" whodunnit "" . If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you . Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent.The film portrayed the life of a traitor . A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things . As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man . Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him ( wife , son , mentor ) . Pym is fatally damaged by his father 's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away . He has no real love or loyalty in him.Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series . Very well done though ."	1
"Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors . My parents and I watched together "" C'eravamo tanto amati "" on a summer night : we liked it , but we did n't love it as we loved "" A special day "" . I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated : we often forget to remember him , maybe because his latest films were disappointing . And so , yesterday night , my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece . Writing , direction , cinematography , score and production design were sober and accurate , but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni . They 're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele . Antonietta is an housewife : married with a fanatic Fascist , she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families . Gabriele is simply an Anti - Fascist . They spend together a special day , that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini . I do n't want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film !"	1

Ben Stiller is funny . Jack Black is funny . How could this movie miss ? Well .... it does miss ! This is the unfunniest "" comedy "" I have ever watched . Nobody I have talked with thought it was even slightly funny . It is just a really lame movie . Trust me . Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT ! !"	0
""" Life hits us in the face ........ we must try to stay beautiful""Debut movie from one of Belgian 's best artists ( he sings songs ) , Tom Barman . A long awaited movie and --- happy happy joy joy for Flemish filmmaking --- really worth watching , and a promising piece of work ! It takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a Friday- and night . The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them : we float as they do into Friday night 's party where they kinda ' meet.It 's rhytmic style is very ' thought off ' . Superb use of music . It sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power . Gainsbourg ! QOTSA ! The party scene ( 20minutes ? ? ? ) is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it 's shot . It keeps you really with it while it 's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party ..... so hard to shoot.Thank you menijèr Barman for making this daring movie in these , already some years going , poor times of Flemish filmmaking . You made my day !"	1
The movie was very sweet and heartwarming ! I cry almost every time I watch the movie . I would recommend this movie for every one . The movie was so inspiring to me . The actors did a great job of acting , and the movie was very well played and done . The movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named Paulie . Paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her.After Paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement . Finally this Russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor . Had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life . In the end the man helped Paulie reunite with Marie ( the little girl who raised Paulie ) . Love overcame all the obstacles .	1
Writer - director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man , recently widowed , learning in the last three weeks he is HIV - positive ; he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had , brings him to an apartment and ties him up , forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive . Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out . James Marsden 's captive is realistically cynical and snotty , but the actor 's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting -- it 's like watching a roadshow version of Tom Cruise . Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role , but his personality - turn from shy guy to kidnapper - on - the - edge is n't convincing , and neither are the conversations the two men have . Marsden 's gay party boy is n't apathetic , of course -- he 's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman 's plight -- but he does n't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance . The movie is n't a cop - out , exactly , but it is a fraud , handicapped further by the bad editing , the poorly - conceived flashbacks , the low - budget production , and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama . * 1/2 from * * * *	0

This was an exteremely good historical drama . John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character 's manic affectations such as his strange dancing . Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover Natalia.The relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by Gorris and familiar Nabokov preoccupations such as ' eternal innocence ' ( i.e. ' Lolita ' ) are evident in this film . I think I will now go on to read the novel . It was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye . Brilliant movie !	1
"There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award . Well , it does not deserve an audience as well . Ironically , one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly , the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least . Every frame , you feel you are getting the "" full picture "" , its like someone is "" cropping your view "" from the edges . The story is pathetic . Well , I will be honest , I could not bear to watch the entire movie . The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor . These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal.Take my advice , stay away from this piece of crap ."	0
... Ever . This is the bottom . I am not joking . The theater should 've had a warning of some kind . ' Abandon all hope ye who enter here ' would 've been fitting.I do n't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is . Its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse . This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox . The story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched like Mr. Fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes.I remember when the Wayans 's were funny . I guess the pressures of Hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate . I 'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick - in - the - balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon.I disliked nearly everything about this movie . I wo n't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with Marlon Wayans 's face poorly superimposed over the midget 's body . What I DID like was the ending . Not the movie 's resolution , but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.I gave this movie one star , but it clearly deserves less . I do n't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star . This does deserve a Razzie and I pray to God it gets it.When are people going to learn ; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out . Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film . Avoid it at all costs . You have been warned .	0
"I imagine when Hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together , the talk is not of the Master 's great films like "" North By Northwest "" or "" Strangers On A Train "" , but a lesser - known effort like this one from 1931 , obscure and seriously flawed , which showcases the great director in fledgling form.Emily and Fred Hill ( Joan Barry and Harry Kendall ) are a middle - class London couple scrimping to stay ahead . He begrudges their lot ; she accepts it . Change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle , saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . They make plans for a world cruise . But their problems have only begun.Just ask Richard Hannay , Roger O. Thornhill , or Marion Crane . Well , Marion 's indisposed at the moment , but you get the idea . Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight , setting one up for a perilous journey at best . This is perhaps Hitchcock 's earliest foray into this theme , and not his most successful or memorable . Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element , in this case domestic drama rather than suspense , but the two do not cohere , at least not here.The Hills are a dull , flat couple , with no chemistry or personality . When they find themselves at the Folies Bergère , in the form of cross - cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film , they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers . "" The curtain 's gone up too soon ! "" gasps Emily . "" They are n't dressed . ""When the Hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise , it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing , even if the people they partner off with are drips , too . Emily 's man , Gordon ( Percy Marmont ) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs , which he suggests be filled by Emily . Fred 's girl "" the Princess "" ( Betty Amann ) has Clara Bow 's eyes and Wallace Beery 's five o'clock shadow . There 's also an obnoxious fellow passenger , a dowdy spinster whom Hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . Subtlety was still to come.Everything is shot in an abrupt manner , with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . Hitchcock tries for some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella that does n't come off , and Kendall seems to aim for laughs while Berry plays for tears . When Fred and Emily break off , they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged - together rickshaws , one of many clunky attempts at symbolism.Emily 's the only vaguely sympathetic character , in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with Gordon , but mostly because she 's among the first of Hitchcock 's many magnetic blondes , her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a Botticelli aboard the open deck of a Chinese junk near the film 's conclusion.Matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set - piece for the protagonists to come to grips with , and presumably repair their relationship . Only they are n't active participants in the resolution , and except for the fate of a friendly cat , nothing about the ending resonates.At least you get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s , and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food . "" Rich And Strange "" is Hitchcock paying his dues , and learning his trade , one for scholars but not casual film goers ."	0
Running Man viciously lampoons the modern - day American media complex , and hits its target dead - center . It may be an easy target , but they pull it off none the less . RM effortless takes on pro - wrestling ( featuring some pro wrestlers as the Hunters ) , network television , the Nielsen ratings , the American government ( suggesting it 's entertainment - oriented anyway ) , crime & punishment , and a half - dozen other things along the way . It 's a far cry from the original Stephen King novella , and Arnold is not the Ben Richards of the novella either . But who cares ? It 's basically a Arnie flick , with all the well - choreographed action sequences and one - liners such an undertaking requires .	1

Can someone say BORING ? ? ? The concept was n't too bad , but it was poorly executed . The Canadian locales , and some of the village scenes were nicely shot . However , overall the cinematography came up short . The story could have been great , but the movie just seemed to drag on . There is only so much stupidity a person can take , let alone three bloody hours of it.The best part of the whole movie was the song "" Ishq Kamina "" , and that was only five minutes long .

The kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life , the kind of bad that makes you think "" what on Earth were they thinking to film this in the first place "" , the kind of bad that makes you wish you 'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film , the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun , the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a Pauly Shore film instead .... seriously , I can not explain how very bad this was.Having said that .... there were some semi - amusing laughs , but they are all so much LESS funny than Anchorman . Sure , they tried to make it entertaining and fun , but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason ... it was n't even a little bit good.Do yourself a favour ( or in the USA , a favor ) , and do n't watch this DVD ... it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you do n't want to do that.Okay ... I'm alright now ."	0
"Why did n't Dynamo have any pants ? ! Where did they go ? ? It was never explained . That 's why this movie was so awesome . Plus Starsky gave his kids the AIDS ! ! ! ! Great acting too . Richard Dawson deserved to win Best Supporting Actor ! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "" That hit the spot "" A I D S. This movie was for the "" birds "" . I tried to give this movie the "" stinkeye "" but it continued playing . What am I doing wrong ? ? ? ! ! ! ! I thought the "" HATEBOAT "" was funnnny lol ;) I would like that for a show . Why was n't Dynamo wearing pants . I know his arm WAS skewered but ... What 's up with those crazy futur nets . Why did n't that family feud guy Ray Combs get a net ? ? He could have used one .

Full marks for Pacino 's rendering of the speech over the dead kid 's coffin ; Shakespeare 's Mark Antony would be put to shame!!Was it Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues ? They are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts . I found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice - over postscript.There is little else to talk about in this film ; even John Cusack has done better roles than this one . Interestingly , the film is very male oriented -- the women are mere appendages .	1
"Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime . The film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography , but the screenplay was stilted and wooden . The acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable . You never really believed anything the supporting actors said though . There were the stereotypes- bible - thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance , authoritative Captain , hot - headed soldier , etc . I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I clocked it straight away as Canadian without knowing it to be such - the Telefilm Canada end credits gave it away . I know I 'm a horrible person.Maybe I missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained . Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason . FOCUS people . There 's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians - that 's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them . If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them . The question of their "" immortal soul "" can be resolved later.Also , I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy , these girls are supposed to be the protagonists ? One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives . I guess one is just a victim of her condition who ca n't be necessarily blamed for her actions , but the other is just a murderer who does n't deserve her happy ending ."	0
"When I saw the Dentist , I thought it was very cool . But this movie is not for everyone , especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes . That 's why it has it 's R18 rating . It 's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone , who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman . It 's best to go to your dentist "" before "" you watch this . But if you do n't like going to the dentist already , then it 's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life . the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I 've ever seen . Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist ( Spoiler ) pull out all his cheating wife 's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic ? Overall awesome flick , but not for everyone ."	1
This one - minute film is arguably the first movie ever made . Other inventors had previously filmed actions - like Edison 's motion photography of a sneeze - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium . At the time , of course , their ` cinematograph ' must have bewildered their peers , including their subjects . In this first instance , the brothers record employees leaving their factory , some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera . The Lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle , but ` La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere ' does n't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films . The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers ' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject . Their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world 's people , a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today.Rating : 8	1
"This animation TV series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works . Yes , this is biology but they will never tell it is.I truly think this is the best part of this stream of "" educational cartoons "" . I do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts : skin , skeleton , and of course : organs.<br / > In the same stream , you 'll find : "" Il était une fois l'homme "" which relate the human History from the big bang to the 20th century . There is : "" Il était une fois l'espace "" as well ( about the space and its exploration ) but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future ."	1
"At last - I 've finally got round to it and managed to see a "" clean "" copy of Pakeezah ! Up until now I 've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off Dubai TV sometime in the ' 90 's , with quirky English subtitles , dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own . Having thought the world of such a poor ( and short ) copy I find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought possible.This was the lovely Meena Kumari 's film from start to finish , and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on , finally realising it in 1971 . What a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards , and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in Pakeezah , necessitating a body double . In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.The story of Purity versus Adversity I can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it , but I 'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in India . It 's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message , an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too . But to me it 's the peerless golden music by Ghulam Mohammed as sung by the incomparable Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding . I 've seldom heard such serious , beautiful , poetic , wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack . Singin ' In The Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah has my favourite music - yet Lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her . The only pity is that the also unique Mohammed Rafi only had the one song in here , albeit a classic duet with Lata . < br />Because of all this but not blind to its faults , Pakeezah is my favourite Indian movie , filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur . At the very least watch Pakeezah for a taste of what Indian "" pop "" music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines , the Bollywood Beat and bhangra ."	1
A terrible movie containing a bevy of D - list Canadian actors who seem so self - conscious about the fact they are on - camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.This film is badly written , badly edited , and badly directed . It is disjointed , incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way . McDowell does a great job with what he is given , but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with . It 's not even camp enough to be funny.I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner , and even the sub - characters like Eisen ( with his nasal , whiny voice ) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.Didn't the director see that the ' creature ' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit ? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske 's orange wisps of ' magic ' ( ! ? ! for lack of a better word ) , is obviously the result of bad actors , with no choreographer , overlaid with completely derivative special effects . Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film ( not the good kind ) ? < br />Learn from the mistakes of others ... do n't even waste your time with this one , you 'll regret it like I did . I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid .	0
Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it . I personally like it , but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone . The tomatoes are n't the same , jokes are lame , even the actors are n't as funny . Because that 's the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be - funny.So now following the plot made to laugh , is annoying . They really should n't have done the fourth part to the Killer Tomatoes trilogy .	0
"This is a pretty bad movie . But not so bad as it 's reputation suggests . The production values are n't too bad and there is the odd effective scene . And it does have an 80 's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun . Watch out , too , for Jimmy Nail 's brief appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astoundingly rubbish it 's fantastic . Fantastic too are Sybil Danning 's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 "" remix of Sybil Danning 's boobs . Has to be seen to be believed . As a horror movie it is n't scary , the effects are silly and Christopher Lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance . I guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit . The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that I have forgotten almost everything about them and I just watched this movie earlier tonight . The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie , in fact , bizarrely , they sometimes look more like badly burned apes . The eastern European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel , while being pretty terrible , does at least give the film some added cheese.Overall ? Good for a laugh . Not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be ? And , at the very least , you 've always got Sybil 's knockers ."	0
"I had lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon , then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good . But I did n't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema . When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj . I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie . Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time , okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun . But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya , after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work . I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying . If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie , the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it , my view a much underrated movie.The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times , but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it 's an old tradition . It 's done in present times , lots of people do n't believe in this arrange marriage , but I do . The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly . When Prem meets Poonam for the first time , they show it how it is and that 's reality and my parents where saying that 's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen . It was a very sweet , you feel nervous yet excited , the song "" Do Ajnabe "" shows that very well . Getting back to the story yes it 's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam ( Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao ) and there families . A twist occurs in this movie which is really good , the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box.What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam , how they fall for each other is too sweet . Simple boy and Simple Girl , when they first meet during and after the song "" Do Anjane Ajnabe "" It 's very sweet to watch , She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking . Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that 's when they really do fall for each other . It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have . Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness , you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem . When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl . Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie , her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness . Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too , he is Poonam support in the film , he is her happiness the movie , together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol . If Ishq Vishk did n't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will . "" Mujhe Haq hai "" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show . Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that 's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet . Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to . The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever.The direction is spot on , to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them . To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie . The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop ! The music is amazing , the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for?What I can finally say it , rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good , this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person . Its basically the sweetest journey ever , its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it 's the bestest part of your life  Well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that ? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing ! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing !"	1
"This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb . Like so many films , this is n't Shawshank . But it 's a reasonably good , if predictable , dance competition / personal growth film . If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer , than I think you 'll like it.Judging from the IMDb ratings , my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 , and was "" vote bombed "" with many 1s , as happens to so many films that are n't about the mob , do n't have special effects , or include non - white or non - straight characters.It 's an American film , but it 's not a US film . Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle , and some audiences may think it 's set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit.I liked the music . I liked the dance ( but not convinced it 's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know ) . The characters were easy on the eyes.I do agree the title sucks . I do n't remember anyone in the film saying those words , and it should have an "" s "" . ( No , it 's not a foreign language).There 's not a lot to hate about this film ( and let 's be honest , a vote of 1 means you hated it ) so I can only assume that it 's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it , and that 's sad ."	1
"As a South African , it 's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense!Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini , this "" addition "" to the series is appalling ! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist , leader and warrior . A man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa.The plot of this film , however , is nothing but hogwash , scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid - nineties.While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors , what is David Hasselhoff doing here , rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile?I kept expecting blond , busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits , for no apparent reason . Not that this would 've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party , where someone 's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next "" blockbuster "" ."	0
Spoiler : Bunch of passive - aggressive people having family reunion . The script has them saying and doing things people would never do , at least anyone with a shred of decency . The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion , unaware she will show up as his brother 's girlfriend at the reunion . He tries to defer to his brother 's claim , but she , knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her , teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper , rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch . At one point , she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him . He tries to cover his eyes . His heart is breaking . She thinks it 's funny , until she suddenly decides she does n't want the brother and leaves the reunion.The movie really drags . The audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul . The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable . We almost walked out , but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up , but nooooo . All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills , out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this . Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine ? ? ? Jeez . Shame on them , the writers , the actors , the producers , and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen !	0
This is your standard musical comedy from the ' 30 's , with a big plus that it features some well known ' 30 's actors in small fun cameo's.There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' no - worries ' overall kind of atmosphere , with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it . Appereantly it 's a ' Cinderella story ' but I most certainly did n't thought of it that way while watching the movie . The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling , that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance , when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios.Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . It 's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free . Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson ( without a mustache this time ) as the director of the short.It 's certainly true that all of the cameo 's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem , since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character.The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period , though the rating on here would suggest otherwise.7/10	1
"WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Although I have n't seen them all , The Hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of entertainment , which it did not entertain me at all!!!!I thought that in common with the semi - bad acting , stupid plot scheme , and the twist at the end of the movie , which was very retarded , this movie sucked!!!Okay , so supposively these are people who eat other people . Yeah ...... notice I said people not humans , not because they are n't human , or wait I think they are , OH NO WAIT , THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU!!!!!So okay , are these people cannibals , or are they imbreds , or what are THEY!!!!I mean , maybe they 're just "" THINGS "" that came here to see what people taste like or , are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now , or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE!!WHICH IT WAS!!!So if you think The Hamiltons is good , I ask of you , why , why , WHY , WHY , why was it so awesome , because to me it was just flat out terrible!!!One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons!!!Go see The Gravedancers , Tooth & Nail , or Borderland for a piece of entertainment ! ! ! ! !"	0
This movie is one of the best ever produced by disney.The plot is very original and entertaining . The animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors . ( For the time).Perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor .	1
"In some ways , The Wrath of Kriemhild surpasses Siegfried 's Death , but it also loses some of that film 's greatness . The plot of this one is more cohesive than the first , which is quite amazing . The second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through , until , that is , you get to the climactic battle scenes ; only the Iliad 's are better . Lang and Harbou embellished the Huns . The poet - compiler of the Nibelungenlied did n't know a Hun from his right ball , and as a result they are , more or less , the same as the Burgundians in custom . For example , although the poet clearly describes Etzel as a heathen ( which is Kriemhild 's main concern as Rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him ) , when she gets to Hunland , the first thing she does is go to mass . The Huns here are clearly heathens ; they 're almost like caveman . The depiction of them is hilarious , especially Verbal , the jester , who has two marvelous scenes . Etzel 's character has been given more weight . He is much more formidable . All he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem . Lang and Harbou are masterful at building suspense , especially at the banquet scene , which is intercut with Verbal 's second performance to an amazing effect . However , as is the nature of this half of the poem , the film 's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one , for the most part , except for a dazzling sequence where Etzel 's hall burns down with the Nibelungs inside . The one thing I do have to object to is the way Harbou changes the ending . SPOILERS : in the poem , after Hildebrand captures Hagen and Gunther , they are imprisoned . Kriemhild visits Hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde . He refuses and she herself decapitates her brother . When Hagen still refuses , she decapitates him . Hildebrand ( or possibly Dietrich ) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he , in turn , decapitates her , calling her a "" Devil Woman "" . Etzel , who is much weaker in the poem than he is here , says something silly like : "" Ah me ! "" I can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as Hildebrand brings them from the castle ; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic . I also understand why they did n't have Hildebrand kill Kriemhild : his character is much reduced here ; his name is only mentioned once . But , to have Kriemhild kill herself , adopting Brynhild 's death from the Icelandic sources , is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them . The point of the poem is that Kriemhild 's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil . Here , we simply have her die for her lost love . It 's not as interesting ."	1
"No , this was n't one of the ten worst films of the 1980 's , but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere . This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 . How else would you explain special effects pre - dating "" An American Werewolf in London , "" disco still being considered cool , and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States ? While we 're at it , let 's not overlook those 1970 's hairstyles in the 1950 's and ' 60 's . I 've seen more of that here than in "" Happy Days "" & "" Laverne & Shirley "" combined.The one woman who elevates this movie to the "" so bad , it 's good "" category was the late , great Elizabeth Hartman , but just barely . Biff plays as Miss Montgomery , the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot , a stereotype that 's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today , but even as a "" hot chick "" she retains her mousey qualities . Her call for help is evidence of this . She also looks much better as Miss Wimp . "" Seven bucks at the beauty parlor , shot to hell . "" She was n't kidding.This is n't to say that there are n't any good parts elsewhere , they 're just few and far between , and I 'm not just saying that because I like Hartman . Incidentally , "" Teen Wolf "" was better than this . "" Teen Wolf Too "" was better than this , and that was n't even so good.<br / >"	0
Who ? What ? Where ? When ? Why ? The acting was terrible . Very robotic , rehearsed . I have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . The screenplay was very elementary . By the end of this film , the story line was tied up . And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up , too . So that he never attempts to write / direct another film .	0

The best film about marriage and family . This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family . This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids . The real intrusion or help of ' friends ' -or executioner if we leave- . The real role of families : they can help or they can destroy us . The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality . A couple who thinks in a ' special ' marriage , live a painful story in their future own history.Who likes contract marriage ? Nobody , after the priest tells their own history   if they leave the future in another hands , if they do n't know WHAT is the marriage . That the problems are true , that the life demand a real engage , guaranties , from each one . That the real victims of the divorce are kids , with real name Andrea in the film- or names . That the abortion is only an easy exit : sadness , regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion . That the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families . The gossip of the ' friends ' , the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone.Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film , but not . Steffania and Tomasso , in the deep of their hearts , they like a beautiful marriage and family , if not , Why they like marriage ? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple : of each one of their decisions , of each one actions in their lives . The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her , only by existing . The screenplay is wonderful . The performances are great : Steffania and Tomasso , ¡ the almost cynical priest ! An excellent direction and script . The colors and the management of the cameras , superb .	1
"First off , I had n't seen "" The Blob "" since I was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience . Pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today . And even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s "" fear of teenagers "" . But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.Sure , it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world . But "" The Blob "" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults do n't believe them . In fact , there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy - colored world . And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.To sum up , if you can take off your postmodern irony filter , there 's a lot more to love here than meets the eye ."	1
"This is how I feel about the show.I started watching the show in reruns in 2001.I enjoy the show but it had too many faults.I HATE THE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS!Stealing story lines from old TV shows . They even stole from "" The Partirdge Family . "" Then in 1 episode "" The Partridge Family "" was mentioned.Actors playing different roles in different episodes . MTV Martha Quinn the most notable doing this , especially when she played herself in 1 episode.The Michelle character COULD NOT take a joke but then they had this little kid act out "" revenge "" to her sisters for a joke by them on her.Story lines that came & went in 1 episode . Joey getting the TV show with Frankie & Annette , never heard from it again after that . Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar . 1 episode he is coaching soccer , 1 episode he is coaching softball / baseball . 1 game & you are out huh Danny ? < br />Jesse & Joey keep getting jobs REALLY QUICKLY with no experience . Only in a TV show.I did like the D.J. & Stephanie characters . Wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure & had a clean NON drug adult life ."	1
Hello . this is my first review for any movie i have seen . i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally , the most disgusting movie i have ever seen . I feel like the movie was porely made , which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it . I felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw . Which i can agree , saw as well is also very graphic , but , i did like the movie saw.The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen . the scene lasted almost forever , well actually , it was probably around 5 min but still . i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good . this director uwe boll , and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one . one final note haha ! ! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WATCHING ANIMALS BEATIN TO DEATH , LETTING ROT , WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF SOMEONE GETTING THERE HEAD SMASHED IN WITH A HAMMER then you will enjoy this movie , if not , and you like horror , go with a higher budget film , like saw for example . I ca nt believe people actually make movies like this . anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart , this is just my opinion on the movie .	0
"It 's sort of hard for me to say it , because I so greatly enjoyed both "" Targets "" and "" Paper Moon "" , but I thought "" The Last Picture show "" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self - indulgent film . Its main positive , as far as I 'm concerned , is the stunning photography . But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty ( and a kind of hidden beauty , at that ) . The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about . Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting , but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story , complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher 's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on . It was like "" American Graffiti "" without the joy of life.Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess . But for me the film was simply oppressive , and I want to see it again about as badly as I 'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I 'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty , just by seeing something different on the screen . But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like , say , Godard 's "" Breathless "" . Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film 's weaknesses . But in the post - Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth . We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show . First we see Vincente Minnelli 's "" Father of the Bride "" -- Liz Taylor 's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny 's girlfriend and Minnelli 's studied upper - middle class milieu contrasts to the character 's "" real life "" surroundings in a similar way . Later , clips from Howard Hawks ' "" Red River "" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé . It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor 's butt , much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on - screen reverie with Boris Karloff in "" Targets "" . I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self - indulgent , like so much of the rest of this film.Ultimately , I 'd rather see another film by Hawks , Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich 's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less - than - subtle way . Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation ."	0
"I saw it last night on TV , and was quite delighted . < br />It is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart , and believe that there is still some goodness in the world ( all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her- the old policeman is my favourite ) , although you know that this story is not quite realistic.I loved acting ( they all seemed just as ordinary , common people , living in small picturesque English coast town ) but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has ! Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their "" tea""!!Perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing , but it did n't stop me from really , really enjoying the whole story !"	1
Joel Schumaker directs the script he co - wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations . The story line is a scrambled mess , but some scenes are actually good . There is a lot of wasted talent and time here . The cast is more impressive than the movie . Featured are Demi Moore , Rob Lowe , Judd Nelson , Andrew McCarthy , Emilio Estevez , Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham . The most notable being McCarthy and Moore . Lowe is quite obnoxious . Coming of age is not so damn easy .	0
Lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of Jane Austen 's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th Century England . Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other . Good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material ( which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism ) . I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up , and I thought it did n't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do . Very good results .	1
"I 'm going to keep this review short and sweet .... I saw the trailer for this and thought I 'd give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were "" what the hell is this ? "" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I was picking my jaw up from off the floor . This film is a great example of how different a movie can be , and furthermore it 's french . This film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package , the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first did n't do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and I found myself wishing every film was made like this . I think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters ( Just watch any Hong Kong legends film in English to see a perfect example)I gave it 9 although I gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels ...."	1
I feel like I 've just watched a snuff film .... a beautifully acted , taut , engrossing and horrible thing ! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word , sexual violence and torture , rape , decapitation , incest , corruption , live burial , and abuse , abuse , abuse . No redemption whatsoever . And I WAS entertained . I could n't stop watching . What does this say about me , about the people who make and act in this sort of thing , and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm . And I 'm neither puritanical nor humorless , I do n't try to hide from the existence of darkness , and I definitely have not led a sheltered life , but I am ashamed of myself . AND I 'm sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject - matter sewers the way my own tribe does . It does n't have to be cozy , but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism ?	0
"The "" Amazing Mr. Williams "" stars Melvyn Douglas , who did five films in 1939 , one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo . His co - star was Joan Blondell ( Maxine ) , who ALSO did five films that year , THREE of which they made together ! Douglas is Lt . Williams , and he and his co - horts are presented with a dead body , and they must figure out what really happened . Viewers will recognize his co - workers - the actors ( Clarence Kolb , Donald MacBride , Don Beddoe ) always played positions of authority ... senators , bank presidents , policemen . This who - dunnit has a flair of comedy to it -- the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other , and even Williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally . Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend . There 's a lot of fun stuff in here , so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on . Do n't want to give away any spoilers , so you 'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies . Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies , and was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point ."	1
I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70 's when I was barely 16 while viewing another film . Oh ! ! ! ! how excited me and my best friend were . we could n't wait for the month or so until it would come on . I saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre . I love , love , love it . Kris is so perfect for the film . He is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with Babs and it is so endearing to watch it again . When they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie . The way he looks at her and he is so proud . I could watch this movie every day . We tried to dress like est - her I even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore . this came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to . Maybe its just that I was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme do n't know . The ending always has me in tears even today .	1
""" Let 's Bowl "" started out on local television in the Twin Cities . It came on late at night , something you 'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of Hamm's.Even the ads were locally produced , featuring Wally outside Grumpy 's Bar , holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- "" Ahh ... over to you , Steve Sedahl . "" Not sure why , but that one always made me laugh.There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers , but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips . Sedahl played it straight , counter - balanced by Rich Kronfeld 's bizarre and hilarious "" Wally Hotvedt . "" Highlights included segments like "" How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball "" ( chuck them into a lake ) and "" Tips on Dating , "" where the duo "" date "" a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint , "" I could have done that myself ! "" < br />Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel , pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor 's Falls , dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over - sized headphones . Hilarious ! < br />Wally 's awestruck comments about "" league bowlers , "" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights.""Let 's Bowl "" was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments , but the network never really knew what to do with it , running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling "" competition , "" which was never the point of the show . The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ( Ernie , the Pig , Butch , etc . ) were more distractions than anything else . The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced . Even Jon Stewart dissed Let 's Bowl on the Daily Show -- ( not enough lame , snide jokes ? ) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better.How often does a "" Let 's Bowl "" come along in the world of modern television , a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap ? The networks have the "" total crap "" part down cold , but it 's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark , strange , funny little gem like "" Let 's Bowl . "" < br />Here 's hoping they 'll put it out on DVD ."	1
"Universal 's answer to "" The Exorcist "" is n't a very good one . Unfortunately , the film offers bland , unimaginative direction from Michael Winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater - sized plot - holes . Not to mention , it 's unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story.Model Cristina Raines moves into a high - rise owned by the Catholic Church with a creepy , blind priest John Carradine , who holes up in there always at the window . She begins to suffer faint spells and nausea . What 's worse is tenants she meets in the building such as Burgess Meredith(with a cat and a canary!)and a young Beverly D'Angelo as a lesbian . Ava Gardner(looking great at 55)is the Realtor who showed Raines the place . Cristina 's lover is Chris Sarandon , whose wife "" committed suicide "" after finding out they were having an affair . José Ferrer has a small role as the "" Priest of the Brotherhood "" who informs Monsignor Arthur Kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high - rise not only housing Carradine but Raines as well . Sarandon sends a hired - hand up to the high - rise one night to check out a certain room above Cristina 's apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket . He winds up dead the very same night Cristina "" kills "" her DEAD father in a nightmare . Screaming mad on the street , Cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective Eli Wallach and partner Christopher Walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to Sarandon who is a hot - shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife 's suicide . That case is really a motivating factor is Wallach 's dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on Cristina and if Sarandon has anything to do with it . You also have Martin Balsam as a professor who understands this type of Latin Cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer and Tom Berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room(now renovated)that Cristina once stayed in ! What bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation . Towards the end of the film Wallach and Walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating . Their characters are just left on the back - burner . How the priests know that "" now is the time "" when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high - rise and why Cristina suffers through the trauma she does is n't adequately explained . How certain ghosts just appear to Cristina and disappear when she tries to show Gardner the rooms they occupied during a cat 's birthday(see for yourself)isn't adequately explained . Not to mention Gardner 's role in the grand scheme of things .. she brings people to that high - rise , but what is really her reasons in the film ? It seems like this film should 've been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary ."	0
Here we go with other slasher movie , Good looking people and Acting from everyone was really good!Few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids ! 20 Years after they are still friends , They go to huge house , have fun , Drugs and Sex ( no nudity ) for least half a hour of the movie ! Again they start making pranks phone call all over again ! and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with axe just like Urban Legend movie,Deaths scene really weird , really odd times too.Nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless < br />The twist killed the movie for me so I going to give it 4/10	0
"I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk . The portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species . Their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized . Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure ; or they have a fascination with chickens . They are on the make or beating each other up . It 's as if the scriptwriter said , what can I make up for them to do , without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is . Watch the wonderful human portrayal in "" One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest "" where the illnesses are believable and real . I once worked in a State Mental hospital . I did n't see any of these guys . These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life ."	0
""" It 's like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like , and to stir up like contro- like -versy and make us more like money and like stuff . "" - Ellen , the lost quote.""Kissing , Like , On the , Like , Mouth And Stuff "" is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made . Watching like Ellen 's hairy arms and like Chris masturbating was like the height of my years - long movie - viewing experience and stuff . But before I like begin like breaking new U.S.-20-something - airhead records with the my "" likes "" , let me like just briefly list like the high- like -lights of this visual like feast : < br />1 . Chris doing the deed with his genitals . And not just that : the way the camera ( guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick ) rewards the viewer with a full - screen shot of Chris 's fat white - trash stomach after he finishes the un - Catholic deed - that was truly thrilling . I can in all honesty say that I 've never seen such grace . Chris , you should do more such scenes in your next movies , because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant , brilliant man , Lars von Trier and his "" Idiots 95 "" , started . A quick w * * * and then a hairy , fat , white belly : what more can any movie - goer ask for ? ! Needless to say , I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate ( in spite of the fact that I 'm straight ) ... Such poetry in motion . Such elegance , such style . No less than total , divine inspiration went into filming that sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy . Even Barbra Streisand could not get any more spiritual than this.2 . Ellen 's hairy , thick arms . The wobbly - camera close - ups , so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography ( I ca n't emphasize this enough ) , Ellen and Patrick , often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question . There were several scenes when we would see a part of a body ( a leg , arm or foot ) , yet it was often a guessing game : does that body - part belong to a man or a woman ? Naturally , Chris and his fellow artists , Ellen , Patrick and whatsername , cast themselves on purpose , because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender - based confusion . It was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg . Patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements , so hairless and pristine , whereas Ellen and the other girl are so very butch , what with their thick legs and arms . Brilliant . < br />3 . Brilliant - especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes : so utterly original and mind - blowing . Ellen behaves like a man , wants sex all the time , while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl . Spiffing.4 . Ellen 's search for a Leftist mate . "" He must love ' The Simpsons ' , which is quite Leftist . "" I am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent Leftists . Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change . The number of "" likes "" that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal ( 3,849 , to be exact ) . They have managed to realistically transfer their real - life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort , and I applaud them for that.5 . The close - ups of toes . Plenty of stuff here for foot - fetishists , which I think is a very liberal , highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities . After all , shoe- and foot- fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema , so it 's nice to see that someone out there CARES.KOTM , or rather , KLOTLMAS , offers more than meets the eye . It is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations . No , it 's much more than that . It 's about the light that guides all silly creatures ; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo - artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school , and plan to assault our senses with dim - witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes , enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change , with which they will later hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of ALL political problems this world faces . What better way to do that than by making porn at the very start ? < br />If Chris and Ellen did the camera here , as is clearly stated in the end - credits , then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it ? They probably hired some passers - by and shoved the camera into their hands ... Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 , and check out my "" TV & Cinema : 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism "" list ."	0
""" Holly "" is an issue - driven film , but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental . At its heart is it is a character - driven film , which would n't be nearly so successful without the fleshed - out portrayals of Patrick ( Ron Livingston ) , the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience , and Holly ( Thuy Nguyen ) , the strong - willed but ultimately over - matched young Vietnamese girl . From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing , everything is forthright and well - done . The contemporary classical score may put some off at first , but it is top - notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout . This film , which raises many issues but provides few clear - cut answers , ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight . Kudos to those who managed to get it made ."	1

"OK , I do n't really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines , because they kick ass . They just ... conflict with each other.For Example : Near the end of the movie , it shows Ricky and Julian telling "" Patrick Lewis "" to put the dog down and walk away . Then at the end , it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they 've been in jail for 2 years . In the TV series pilot , the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at "" Patrick Lewis "" . But in the TV series , they 've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.Also , they give us the impression that the movie 's story line and the TV series ' story line are connected ( because of the yelling scene between the guys ) . But some actors portray totally different characters . Of course , Patrick Roach plays "" Patrick Lewis "" in the movie , but in the series he plays Randy . Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination , and then he plays Sam Losco in the series.Also ( again ... I know , I have a lot to say ) , in the movie , the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash . The thing is , they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway , other than the yelling scene.Sorry to keep on blabbing ."	1
Brothers with psychokinetic powers ( yes , really ) duel not just for Debra Winger 's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.There are surreal touches ( the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus ) , but there is also humour and romance . The soundtrack is great similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I do n't think I 'll ever forget Dennis Quaid ( mmmmm Dennis Quaid ) , setting his own trailer a rockin ' to ' She 's a lady ' ~ priceless ; ) < br />Best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ ' Once you 've had a clown , you never go back!'I love this movie ( I ordered the DVD from the US ) and if the comments written by the kind of people who 'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 do n't put you off ~ give it a try :)	1
""" National Treasure "" ( 2004 ) is a thoroughly misguided hodge - podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written . The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates ( how precious is that , I ask you ? ) ; a seemingly normal fellow who , for no other reason than being of a lineage of like - minded misguided fortune hunters , decides to steal a ' national treasure ' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers . After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably ( unintentionally ) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot , the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a ' Stanley Goodspeed ' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane , but disconnected misadventures.The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king 's ransom someplace on native soil , and then , going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work , is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining . Could n't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country ? Hence , we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth . Ben 's intentions are noble  if confusing . He 's set on protecting the treasure . For who and when ?  your guess is as good as mine.But there are a few problems with Ben 's crusade . First up , his friend , Ian Holmes ( Sean Bean ) decides that he ca n't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives ( oh , yeah  brilliant idea ! ) . Presumably , the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune . So Ian tries to kill Ben . The assassination attempt is , of course , unsuccessful , if overly melodramatic . It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up , and pick on , the very sultry curator of the archives , Abigail Chase ( Diane Kruger ) . She thinks Ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning . But true to action / romance form , Abby 's resolve melts quicker than you can say , "" is that the Hope Diamond ? "" The film moves into full X - File - ish mode , as the FBI , mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft , retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi - layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive . Honestly , do n't those guys ever get ' intelligence ' information that is correct ? In the final analysis , "" National Treasure "" is n't great film making , so much as it 's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies , woven together from scraps , the likes of which would make IL ' Betsy Ross blush.The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of . The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors , natural flesh tones , solid blacks and clean whites . The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements . The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism . Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made . If only , as an audience , we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure , this might have been one good flick . Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer , audio commentary and deleted scenes . Not for the faint - hearted  just the thick - headed ."	0
"An old saying goes "" If you think you have problems , visit a hospital . "" That has been updated in recent years to "" If you think you have problems , watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer 's ! "" This movie is one of those that is so bad , it 's good ! That 's why I gave it a seven - it 's all right , but not great . It 's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as "" an hour of your life you 'll never get back ! "" All the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing Jerry , etc . The shocker was watching Molly Hagan , who normally plays sweet characters ( "" Seinfeld "" and "" Herman 's Head "" ) playing a trailer - trash mom and Jaime Pressly ( "" My Name Is Earl "" ) as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . The men ( including the staff producer ) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . I do n't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show .

First off , I must admit that both films I 've seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points . My Czech is n't bad but , having sat through two of his films , I wish I had n't even tried to learn . Samotari is too cool . Way too cool . It 's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together . That 's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague ( tiny , really . ) The main characters are between 20 and 30 . They 've got jobs and only one studies . The best character is the young Balkan girl . Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day . That 's about it . The only great character . Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own . How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence ? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in film ? If you like alright music , see this film . If you want to laugh at others ' stupidity , see this film . If you like irony and dry humor , see an original Jarmusch not an imitation . And under NO circumstances see Ondricek 's film , Septej ( Whisper . ) That is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes .	0
"Bertrand Blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of French cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public . Filmed with his fave duo ( Depardieu and Dewaere ) and the usual dose of sex ( Miou - Miou plays her typical role , at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever ) . In first "" Les Valseuses "" is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals . Those who only are satisfied with family life , or simply know nothing more , the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that , it just let you think of all the usual things in life ( working for the car , being bounded at work etc . ) . It 's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we 're living in . Great job and it just makes you wish two things : Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu , he 'd better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him . Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some ..."	1

David Mamet 's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking - man 's movie , a movie that makes you question everybody and everything . I saw it for the first time recently and could n't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a best - selling author . Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone . She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient 's gambling debt to a shark named Mike ( played by Joe Mantegna , who is the only reason to watch this film ) . She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her . Intrigued , she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate ( she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book ) . She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.I do n't feel like going into details , but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of $ 80,000.First of all , the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable . Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads . Not only that , but the audience ( and the main character ) knows that they 're dealing with con men , so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned ? Besides , Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people , yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind , she knows full well that Mike is a con artist.Secondly , we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning , yet in order for the con to ultimately work , she had to do several things that the con men could n't possibly have predicted that she would do . First , she had to decide to help settle her patient 's debt , allowing her to meet the con men in the first place . If she had n't done this , the entire con would have failed . I just have to say that it 's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient 's gambling debt . Not only that , but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up ? Did they simply show up at that bar every night , hoping she would come and see them ? Another thing that had to happen that could n't have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade . What are the odds of this happening ? And yet the whole con is based on this premise.Another problem I had is with the ending . Margaret finds out she 's been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike . At first , Mamet leads us to believe that she 's going to con the con , but that falls through , so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area . Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade . Not only that , but she did n't even take back the money he stole from her.Ultimately , the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled . And if you , like me , predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned , you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying .	0
Why should you watch this ? There are certainly no reasons why you should n't watch it ! Superbly and amusingly directed by Albert and David Maysles , Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of East Hampton , but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales , the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . Their life was certainly an amusing one ( Edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas , Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats , one was named Ted Z. Kennedy ) The film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released ( in February 1977 ) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and Edie received after the film ( she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and is still living in Miami Beach . This film is both engaging and spellbounding .	1
"Twelve years ago , production stopped on the slasher flick "" Hot Blooded "" since almost everyone on the set started dying . Now , a couple of film students have decided to finish the film , despite the fact that there 's a rumor that the film is cursed . Well , they 're about to find out that some curses are real.When Scream was released , every country seemed to want to cash in on its success , even Australia . The concept , which today has been done to death ( a slasher film within a slasher film ) was at the time relatively cool and original . This movie was released right before Urban Legends : Final Cut and Scream 3 ( well not in the US but in Australia ) so it felt like the first movie with this concept . When Urban Legends 2 was released , most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie was n't even good , the movie flopped disastrously . Now , Cut is not the best slasher flick ever , and nor does it try to be . It knows that it 's a rip - off , and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of Neve Campbell in the starring role . But instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story , they 've decided to rip - off some 80s slasher flicks like "" Nightmare on Elm Street "" as well and surprisingly enough , this actually works . The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer ! And instead of trying to scare the audience to death , they 've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . There are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that I was n't able to fully ignore , the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . Spoiler ahead ; I mean , they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene ? It makes no sense I tell you . End of spoilers . All in all , Cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but I consider this to be one of the better Scream rip - offs that never made it big . I 'm surprised that this one never got a sequel , but I guess it simply came out too late . < br />Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares . Cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and I will have to recommend this one even though I consider the story to be quite silly since it 's completely ludicrous ."	1
"Do n't know how this missed award nominations . Great film . Certainly of the calibre of "" Beautiful Mind "" Great acting , photography , script and drama . I ca n't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film ."	1
This is easily a 9 . Michel Serrault , known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career , does a stunning , even worryingly stunning job of impersonating Dr Petiot , a legendary French serial killer.He is just so believable at every and any moment in the film , that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the very best ever achieve this feat , and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at best.The whole story ( a real story which happened in 20th century France ) is so powerful , so sinister - it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long , long time .	1
"I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about , to prevent it from happening again . I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK . The movie was pretty terrible . All cliché , no real plot . Historical and technical inaccuracies abound . Look up the technical specs on DE 529 , or any Everts class Destroyer Escort , and you will see what I mean . I now its black history month in the US , and I m going to be called a racist just for saying this , but the history of this ship is not that great . They did some escort work , chased a "" submarine "" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed . Sorry , but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for . This movie makes them look like whiners . Let the name calling commence , I can handle it ."	0
Although John Woo 's hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie . But i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie . I say this because the stunts , the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with Chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor . OUCH ! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98 . ( Or something in 14 dollars.)VHS new line home video . any questions or comments please feel free to reply . ( i 'm only 14 but i know where you can find any movie ever made . ) if you looking everywhere for a movie and ca n't find it please reply to me . Thank you and good night !	1
"The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel hinted at the idea the Wenders has lost his vision , his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture . The Land of Plenty seals the coffin , I 'm afraid , by being a vastly unimaginative , obviously sentimental and cliché'd film . The characters are entirely flat and stereotyped , the writing , plot and direction are amateurish , at best . For the first time in quite a while , I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life . The war - torn delirium of the uncle , the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion ... it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic , hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen . What happened ? The days of experimentation , perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him , I 'm afraid . Let 's hope he finds his inspiration again ... At the Toronto film festival , which is where I saw the film , Wenders was there to introduce it . Completely lacking in humility , he offered us the following : "" I hope ... no , wait ... I KNOW you 're going to enjoy the next two hours . "" I 'm afraid he could n't be more wrong ..."	0
In a series chock - full of brilliant episodes , this one stands out as one of my very favorites . It 's not the most profound episode , there 's no great meaning or message . But it 's a lot of fun , and there are some fine performances.But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is , to my knowledge , the * only * Twilight Zone episode with a * double * snapper ending . The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story . But this time , you get a surprise , and think that 's that , but it turns out there 's * another * surprise waiting . I just like that so much , that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes ( the other being a deeper , more message - oriented one ) .	1
I saw this movie in 1976 , my first year of living in New York . I went on to live there for the next 26 years , but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie . It was part of a PBS series as I recall , and I 've never forgotten it . < br />There are no sex scenes to speak of , just delicate , moving , extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement , all set within a conservative , Boston ( I think ) , World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war , and did not seek out a career and financial independence . Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.There has to be a video of this movie ? Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video ?	1
I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that it 's TV movies five seconds into the picture . This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy , well - crafted mood that is established from the very start . While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story ( even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver , B.C. ) , the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos ' excellent acting .	1
I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood , I could n't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery . But I did really like the concept . If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie . That said , having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it , though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending ) . < br />There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments , my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ) . < br />For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll . By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing , when seven I though the ' relationship ' guff was a bad thing.For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action , especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors . The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and , lets face it , humorous . I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid , and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general do n't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum , they 've got heavy calibre machine guns , mortars , rocket launchers , a tank and a helicopter and they 're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs . Which is what I 'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.In short the movies worth watching , it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise , and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique .	1
"* * * SPOILERS * * * On of the first WWII movies coming out of Hollywood that shows how the war effected those GI 's , or in this case US Marines , who fought in it.21 year old Al Schmid , John Garfield , was just starting to live with a well paying job - earning some $ 40.00 a week - at the local steel mill and girl Ruth Hartley , Elenore Parker , whom he was about to marry when the Japs spoiled everything for him , and millions of likewise young Americans , by attacking the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor . Doing his duty as an American citizen Al immediately joined the US Marine Corps hoping to get back at the Japs knowing , correctly as it was to turn out , that the Marines would be the first American combat units to get a crack at them.Al finally got his chance when his unit , the 1st Marine Division , landed on August 7 , 1942 at Guadalcanal in the far flung Solomon Islands to engage the Japanese who were were in control of it . It was during the battle of the Ilu River that Al almost single handed stopped a massive Japanese Banzai attack holding off , with his machine gun , wave after wave of suicide attacks by the determined Japs until help , or reinforcements , finally arrived . It was during the bloody fighting Al was hit in the face by a Jap grenade that ended up blinding him.Now back in the states convalescing at a naval hospital Al is faced with something far more harder to overcome then battling a battalion size attack of Japanese or German soldiers . He 's faced with a future where he 'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after , or for , him!We get to see in the film "" Pride of the Marines "" Al battle himself far harder then he did the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal in just coming to terms with his disability . Not wanting anyone , especially his girlfriend Ruth , to feel sorry for him Al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie . It 's with the help of Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer , Rosemary DeCamp , and Ruth together with his US Marine buddy Lee Diamond , Dane Clark , that in the end gives Al the courage to face his blindness with the same strength that he faced wave after wave of Japanese troops on Gudalcanal . A courage Al thought he lost back in that God - forsaken island hell in the South Pacific.Based on the true story of US Marine Sergeant Albert Schmid "" Pride of the Marines "" showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded US Servicemen coming back from the war . We get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime America when they left something , like in the case of Al Schmid , behind on the battlefield . Al 's battle with his personal demons was a lot harder then the Japanese that he fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them . Despite the help that he got from both Nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth as well as his Navy doctor - who has a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck - it still was up to Al to overcome the fears that he faced . Fears which he and only he had to both battle and overcome , like he was told by everyone in the movie , all by himself ."	1
' Moonstruck ' is a love story . There is not one romance , there are at least three , but they all have to do with the same family . Loretta 's family . Loretta ( Cher ) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri ( Danny Aiello ) . She does n't love him , but he is sweet and good man . When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnny 's brother Ronny ( Nicolas Cage ) . He and Johnny have n't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding . Of course they fall instantly for each other.How this story and love stories of Loretta 's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself . Every seen is a delight to watch , with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything . She won and really deserved the Oscar that year . Cage is pretty good , and goofy as well , and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta 's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific . This movie is funny , charming and therefore highly enjoyable .	1
"I do n't remember "" Barnaby Jones "" being no more than a very bland , standard detective show in which , as per any Quinn Martin show , Act I was the murder , Act II was the lead character figuring out the murder , Act III was the plot twist ( another character murdered ) , Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty ( Lee Meriwether ) asking her father - in - law Barnaby Jones ( Buddy Ebsen ) how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show.One thing I do remember was the late , great composer Jerry Goldsmith 's excellent theme song . Strangely , the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air . I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being badly miscast . I just wished the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it.Update ( 1/11/2009 ) : I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel . Let 's just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the show "" Barnaby Jones . """	0
"This is the worst brain damaged , ultra cheap , super stupid , silly , pointless piece of trash I 've ever seen , an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre . If you think that Ed Wood 's "" Plan 9 "" is bad , well ... let me tell you , looks like "" Citizen Kane "" compared to that one . ¿ Special effects? ... again , "" Plan 9 "" is "" Star Wars "" . ¿ Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it 's beyond bad , really . But if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies , it 's for you ! I 'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies , the Price - Corman - Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff , but with "" Star Creatures "" they descend right down to the Z level . Of course , my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun ( the guy playing an Indian chief is great ) so have fun and enjoy ... if you can ."	0
This movie could only originate in the 1970 's ! ! It 's a bizarre action movie set in a small California workers town . Some sort of mill or plant is closing down , so suddenly , rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets ! The townsfolk 's are fed up ! So Ben Arnold ( Jan Michael Vincent ) , goes to another town to recruit his brother , Aaron , played by Kris Kristofferson . Aaron is a Vietnam Vet who looks and acts a little  off balance . He hangs out with a bunch of other surly Vietnam vet 's . They come into town to clean it up ( they become deputized ) , but underneath their good deeds , they are actually running gambling houses , asking for protection money , etc . ! ! ! It takes a while for people to catch on , and in a biblical Cain and Abel showdown , Vincent has to take on his older brother . There 's an interesting blue - collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie , which makes it interesting ( note the cock - fighting scene ! ) . Vincent is almost too angelic in this role  he thinks so highly of his brother , he can not conceive of him committing the evil deeds he 's accused of . He finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend , Victoria Principal , is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home . Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron . He coolly denies any wrong - doing , and even gently coos and talks to Vincent 's young daughter ( she refers to him as ' Uncle Aaron ' ) even while he 's threatening her father 's life , all the while smiling ! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other . Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a ' saloon ' girl who attracts Aaron 's attention . This is a good 70 's action movie , if you can find it ! ! It is NOT available on DVD yet 	1
I rented this film to see what might be a bloody , non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action - drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard . Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks , he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever . The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard , I swear ! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar . Super homoerotic . Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back . There is no good fight scenes at all , the punches are two inches away from a person . Characters personalities change in matter of seconds . One guy is a bad and in the next scene he 's good . The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick . I hated this film .	0
This was excellent . Touching , action - packed , and perfect for Kurt Russel . I loved this movie , it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars . This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering , and people who learn that there is a time for fighting , a need to defend . I cried , laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story . Good writing job for an action flick , and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid . The ending was n't twisty , but it was still excellent . If you like escape from New York , or rooting for the underdog , this movie is for you . Not an undue amount of gore or violence , it was not difficult to watch in that respect . Something for everyone .	1
"note to George Litman , and others : the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "" I do n't think so , * breeder*"".my favorite riff is "" Why were you looking at his ' like ' ?

"" over all , I would say we must give credit to the MST3 K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie . you really ca n't make much fun of the dialog ; Bill S was a good playwright . on the other hand , this production is so bad that even he would disown it . a junior high school drama club could do better.I would recommend that you buy a book and read ' Hamlet ' ."	0
When I was a little girl ( and my dad owned a video store ) , this was among my favorite movies . I had n't heard much about it since then , nor did I really remember anything about it , it having been forgotten in the wake of Don Bluth 's other , probably better films . I managed to track it down a few weeks ago , however , and was pleasantly surprised again . Set in New Orleans in the 1930s , the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable . There are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough , but they generally do n't detract from the storyline , which leaves you smiling ( and maybe even a little misty - eyed , if you are a lover of animals ) . The characters are believable ( maybe even a little too grown - up for younger watchers ) , as well . Two paws up , and for those of you who have n't seen it in a while , definitely worth a re - watch .	1
"How to lose friends and Alienate people came out in 2008 . It bombed at U.S. Box offices . It 's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast . Simon Pegg is great playing Sidney Young , who wrote the book "" How to lose friends and Alienate people . I know it 's not a true story . The only way I know that is because Sidney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Maes . Sophie Maes does n't exist , but other than that , the film could be real . How to lose friends and Alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 , and I think you definitely should see it . As I said earlier , the film has a fantastic cast including : Kirsten Dunst(Spider - Man , The Virgin Suicides ) Danny Huston(The Number 23 , 30 days of night ) Gillian Anderson(The X - Files ) Megan Fox(Transformers , Confessions of a teenage drama Queen ) Jeff Bridges(The Big Lebowski , The Vanishing ) Overall , How to lose friends and Alienate people is hilarious . I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst do work well together , and I think you should see it . Though there is some odd nudity including Trans - sexuals , it 's a hilarious and awesome comedy . One of Simon Pegg 's best.The Plot : Sidney Young , a journalist from England , travels down to New York to work at Sharp magazines . While there , he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does ."	1
Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting , I grabbed this title.Unfortunatly , this movie contains more gun battles ( ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good ) , than Jet Li and company 's acrobatic fighting . Thus it was a let down.The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny , considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me , more on the line of say Jackie Chan.But alas I 'd recommend Fist of Legend , Tai Chi Master , or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score	0
This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I 've seen . I say pretty much , because I have also seen Soldier , in which he plays the villain ... but from what I 've heard , it 's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film . This , however , is . And if this is any indication of the quality of such films , I wo n't be seeing any of the others . Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist ... as the lead , he 's awful . He gets in a fight with random no - name characters every few minutes of the film , probably because the script writer could n't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film . The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality , and aside from the fact that he 's certifiably insane , he barely seems like a villain at all . The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time ... or maybe it 's the other way around . I ca n't say for sure ... and I definitely would n't watch it again to make sure . The effects are not completely horrible ... but it 's close . The title comes from the popular idea of using a time - machine to go and kill Hitler . Somehow , the film screws up that interesting idea as well . The plot is too complicated for its own good . The pacing is poor . I ca n't think of one positive thing to say about this film ... I really ca n't . It 's simply too formulaic and pointless . If only I had a time - machine , so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made ... no , never mind . I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible . Listen to the negative reviewers . Avoid this turkey . I recommend this to fans of Lee , and no one else . If you 're looking for a quality film ... well , this is n't it . That 's for sure . 1/10	0
Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short - a situation is designed , conflict arises and mayhem ensues . The characters behave in appropriate ways , the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos . The best ( and funniest ) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected - all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes . A word of warning - it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine ! Highly recommended .	1
This movie scared the crap out of me ! I have to admit that I spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what I saw was really scary . I screamed out loud two or three times during the show.Film - making - wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography . The sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful . I read somewhere that it 's some weird husband and wife team that made it . For some reason that makes this even stranger for me . < br />If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you ! Very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls !	1
"Neil Simon 's THE ODD COUPLE set up a model for many of his later plays . Felix Unger and Oscar Madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original , the former being picky and neat , the latter being slovenly and loose . Simon would rewrite ( less successfully ) the play in the 1990s as THE NEW ODD COUPLE , with female roommates . He made it a mixed couple ( a woman with her daughter , and a man ) in THE GOODBYE GIRLS . He also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with THE SUNSHINE BOYS , a Broadway hit starring Jack Alberson and Sam Levine as Al Lewis and Willie Clark , the aged , semi - retired Vaudevillians . Here the "" apartment "" problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who ca n't stand each other . The 1976 film starred Walter Matthau as Willie , and George Burns as Al.In actuality , Al probably does not think totally badly of Willie - Willie is pathological on the subject of Al . First Al had little habits , such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter "" t "" , and slightly jabbing Willie with his index finger , on stage . Secondly , Al retired when his wife died . Willie was not ready to retire ( and has been forcing his nephew and agent , Ben ( Richard Benjamin ) to try to get him jobs in commercials . But Willie ca n't remember lines unless they are funny , and keeps flubbing them . So he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial.Ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about American Comedy . He does bring Al to see Willie , and the sparks begin flying , as neither can figure out what the other is doing ( and this is just in rehearsal . On top of that , Willie is insisting on changes ( minor ones , but they throw off Al ) such as saying "" ENTER ! ! ! "" when Al knocks on the door . The initial rehearsal is a failure , but Ben manages to get them to the taping of the show . The question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will Willie wring Al 's neck?The three leads , Matthau , Burns , and Benjamin , do very well with the one - liners , frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter ( example : "" Chest pains ... I'm getting chest pains Uncle Willie . Every Thursday I come here and get chest pains ! "" "" So , come on Fridays ! "" ) . Benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle , although Matthau 's rough outer shell makes it difficult ( he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville ) . Matthau has a little better grasp on reality ( at first ) than Burns , who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality Matthau 's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly . Burns is not senile - he takes things slowly . But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement.I call this a final "" Voyage of Discovery "" for our modern Lewis and Clark . Al and Willie transcend their old skits , as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought . Even the irascible Willie admits that Al may be ( to him ) a pain in the ass , but he was a funny man.Burns was not the original choice for the part of "" Al Lewis "" ( supposedly Dale of the team Smith and Dale ) . Jack Benny was . Benny probably would have done a good job , but ill - health forced him out ( he died in 1975 ) . Burns ( whose last involvement in any film was in THE SOLID GOLD CADILLAC in 1956 as the narrator ) turned in such a fine performance that he got the "" Oscar "" for best supporting actor , and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as OH GOD ! ; OH GOD , YOU DEVIL ; and GOING IN STYLE .

"Although it was released way back in 1967 , IN COLD BLOOD still remains the benchmark by which all true - crime films are matched . Veteran writer / director Richard Brooks ( ELMER GANTRY ) adapted Truman Capote 's non - fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today , thirty - five years later.Robert Blake and Scott Wilson portray Perry Smith and Dick Hickock , two ex - cons who , on a tip from Hicock 's old cellmate Floyd Wells , broke into the Holcomb , Kansas home of Herbert Clutter , looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $ 10,000 . But no safe was ever found , and the two men instead wound up killing Mr. Clutter , his wife , and their two children , getting away with only a radio , a pair of binoculars , and a lousy forty dollars . Two months on the run , including an aimless "" vacation "" in northern Mexico , ended in Las Vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car . But it eventually comes out , after merciless grilling by Kansas law enforcement officials , that these two men committed that heinous crime in Holcomb . Tried and convicted on four counts of murder , they stew in jail over a five - year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on April 14 , 1965.Blake and Smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they 've done but are concerned about getting caught . John Forsythe also does a good turn as Alvin Dewey , the chief detective investigating the crime , as does Gerald S. O'Laughlin as his assistant . In a tactic that is both faithful to Capote 's book and a good artistic gambit all around , Brooks does not show the murders at the beginning ; instead , he shows the two killers pulling up to the Clutter house as the last light goes out , then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies . Only during the ride back to Kansas , when Blake is questioned by Forsythe and narrates the story , do we see the true horror of what happened that night . We do n't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes , but we do n't need to . The shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the Clutters ' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough , so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher - film violence.Brooks wisely filmed IN COLD BLOOD in stark black - and - white , and the results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall 's expertise . The chilling jazz score by Quincy Jones is the capper . The end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made , devastating in its own low - key fashion . It is a 134-minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation , and should be seen , though viewer discretion is advised ; the ' R ' rating is there for a reason ."	1
Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise : a young Mafia would - to - be killer ( Chandler ) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to California to take some lessons with a very known professional killer ( Beluschi ) . First and most important task : to kill a young woman ( Lee ) that is a completely strange for all of them . But is she a easy target ? The movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine ; even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie . Good performance by Chandler . I give this a 4 ( four ) .	0
""" Broken Bow "" takes us back to where it all began . Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk , Spock and McCoy . This installment of the "" Star Trek "" franchise , is in my opinion the first series since "" TOS "" to recapture the feelings of wonder , danger and excitement of "" Going Where No Man Has Gone Before "" . Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer , the first Captain of the first "" Star Ship Enterprise "" . He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy . John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox , and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol . Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks , and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud ."	1
This is a movie which attempts a retelling of Thai history , set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya . I decided to watch this film because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films I 've watched and enjoyed , one that has Thai actors speaking Thai and martial arts craziness . Well , it 's none of that . This film is shot entirely in English , is chock full of Anglo actors , and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad .... but not funny ! Who can we blame for this rubbish ? The acting , dialog , and most of the sets were quite bad . Some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club . The special effects were also mostly bad , but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect . It has one large , epic - style outdoor battle scene , where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume , but when we see the two armies collide in combat -- HA ! What a joke ! The film does feature a couple of beauties . What a pity they did n't show a little more skin . At least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate . Do n't bother .	0
"When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality . And when it comes to acting , camera work , lighting etc ; this film does the business . It 's done by highly skilled craftsmen . That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours . But when you look under the layers of professionalism , you do n't really find anything . Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view , there 's really nothing there . The script is mediocre , the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood . In all it 's English cosiness , it 's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "" Full Monty "" . Why they made this film ? I have n't got a clue , apart from making money of course ."	0
"Wow this was a great Italian "" ZOMBIE "" movie by two great director 's Luci Fulci ( "" ZOMBIE "" ) and Bruno Mattie ( "" HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD "" ) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen "" HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD "" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "" ZOMBIE "" directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great "" ZOMBIE "" make - up witch equals great looking "" ZOMBIES "" has a funny "" ZOMBIE "" flying head!And "" ZOMBIE "" birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a "" ZOMBIE "" ( That Only Happed To Two People ) but they are mainly just the great toxic "" ZOMBIES "" like in Bruno Matties "" HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"" .

This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year . At times I find it uncomfortable . At times I find it empowering . And I always find the characters human and real . It is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in LA , starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters . It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference . Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take , whether intended or not , has powerful repercussions . I found this movie to be similar in many ways to Robert Altman 's film Short Cuts . Both had a star - studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other , for better or worse . Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message , ( hope in the face of despairing reality ) , than Altman 's film , although I found them both intriguing in their own way . This film is a definite must see ! ! !	1
"A friend once told me that an art - house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats . Of course , my imagination ran amok , trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work . Well , now my imagination can be put to rest.I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work . I have come across many people who thought Tarkovsky 's films are slow - moving and inert . Opinions being what they are , I found this not to be true of the late director 's wonderful works , which are wrought with meaning , beautiful compositions , and complex philosophical questions . Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called the heir to Tarkovsky , I was excited to experience his films.With the exception of the open air ride through the fields ( Stalker ) , this movie has no kinship to anything Tarkovsky has done . It does not seem to possess the slightest meaning , even on a completely mindless level . It 's supposedly "" gorgeously stark "" cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft . There is a no balance , no proportion , and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow . The main character is so inept and indecisive , it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner.I am also not adverse to non - plots or story lines that progress on multiple non - linear fashion . But there is n't even a non - story here . One must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost , as hair - pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a Tarkosky time sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short.I wo n't rule out that this may be one of Sokurov 's stinkers ( Tarkovsky 's Solaris ) , but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky 's heir - based on this film- would be to call Paris Hilton the successor to Aristotle . C'mon guys , do n't be afraid to say it . No amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life . I do n't profess to fully understand Russian culture and I probably do n't have Russian values , but I immediately picked up on Tarkovsky 's work as something magical , a treasure and a gift to viewers.If it did n't have Sokurov 's name on it , and it aired on say , Saturday Night Live , I 'm pretty sure nobody would "" read "" all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick ."	0
This is how movies are supposed to be made : a fascinating setting ; characters about whom you come to care deeply ; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense . This is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental . Highly recommended .	1
Saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival , and it 's a stick - to - your - bones movie -- it 's really stayed with me . Adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel , it 's a back - and - forth - in - time drama with fully rounded characters , thoughtful rumination on life choices , and , I 'm not exaggerating . one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100 + years of movie - making . Wonderful work from everyone , led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a dying , deluded Newport matron , and Claire Danes as her much younger self . Meryl Streep 's daughter Mamie Gummer is , like Mama , the real deal ; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman circa 1958 and does n't overplay the charm ; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing sharp , detailed cameos . Hugh Dancy , also from the stage , does n't bring much edge to the somewhat clichéd role of an unhappy rich wastrel , and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow . But it 's a deliberately paced , visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues , and you can cry at it and not feel like you 're being recklessly manipulated . Also , what a sumptuous parade of 1940s/50s automobiles .	1
This movie was a mess . It had the absolute worst editing I have ever seen . It was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial , and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream.Under the messy direction and editing , there was a glimmer of something good . A good idea , a compelling spark . But somewhere it went wrong.The story is about a quasi - psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . The first thing that is hard to bite into is Richard Grieco as a priest . Well the part does n't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy . He always plays the crazy bad guy . Very ho hum.Oh , a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy , horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character ( Grieco ) was experiencing . And just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . Not a good sign for any movie.<br / >	0
Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them . As I watched this film , made in 1988 , in 1999 , I thought I was watching the O.J. Simpson debacle ( although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation).The Australian news media , if this movie is to be believed , devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought . It was scary to see the scenes of invasive , swarming media hordes , ridiculous accounts of half - truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.Equally appalling is the media 's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case . I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case ( the accused are Seven - Day Adventists).Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.Streep is excellent as usual , and this is the best I 've ever seen Sam Neill . The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible .	1
"Unhinged was part of the Video Nasty censorship film selection that the UK built up in the 80 's . Keeps the gory stuff out of the hands of children , do n't you know ! It must have left many wondering what the fuss was all about . By today 's standard , Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale.3 girls are off to a jazz concert ... and right away , you know the body count is going to be quite low . They get lost in the woods , & wind up getting in a car accident that looks so fake it 's laughable . They are picked up by some nearby residents that live in the woods in a creepy house . One of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs . Then there 's talking . Talking about why the girls are here , and how they must be to dinner on time because mother does n't like it when someone is late . And more talking . Yakkity yak . Some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls , and someone 's eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like Hitchcock 's Psycho . I digress because there is so much blah blah in this film , that you wonder when the killings are going to start . In fact , one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods , alone , looking for the town . Smart move . She probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part , but just did n't care . More talk continues after this as we wait , wait , and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.And then there 's the twist ending . The "" expected "" unexpected for some viewers , for others a real gotcha . Quite possibly the ONLY reason why someone would really want to watch this . I do n't care how twisted it is , nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time I had watching it . Even with the minor impact of the ending , the director just did n't have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it . It would have made a much better 30 minute - 1 hour TV episode on say , Tales from the Darkside.If you really must get this for any reason , perhaps just to say you 've watched every slasher movie , do yourself a favor and have the fast - forward button ready . Since the movie has so many unimportant scenes , just zoom through them , and in no time , you 'll get to the "" WOW , that 's what it was all this time "" ending . Oh and halfway through the movie there 's a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo - bees . Horray for boo - bees . Those beautiful buzzing honey - making boo - bees ."	0
I ca n't believe others took such a serious view of all this . God , it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop - a - long Cassidy . It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago . It was n't meant to be a great cinema experience , except it was . So what if there was n't a big special effects bonanza . It was a fun , tongue in cheek , look at old Western 's . Man , relax and enjoy .	1
This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time . Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard . Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius . The rest of the cast is amazing , and the film is really really funny . A definite satire of horror films , with a zany twist . If you enjoy a fun , comedy filled evening , then go and rent this classic . You 'll laugh all the way through !	1
I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone . We can only hope . While this remake was n't a total waste , I still wish I had the six bucks back to go toward a DVD of the original . Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I 've ever seen . This version does n't add anything new . It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone .	0
I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it . I sure did n't . It 's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars : music throughout the film in almost every single frame , almost no profanity , set in a time long gone , sepia - toned imagery , pretentious title , NO SEX , and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so that we ( the stupid audience ) get it . One thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the NOBEL PRICE WRONG ! Instead they call the Nobel - price ( named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel ) ' the noble - price ' .. Jesus ! How can one make such a mistake in such a big production , supposedly based on a true story . What a sham ! What were you and the others thinking RON ?	0
"When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member , you know you 're in for a bad ride.I went in with very , very low expectations , having read some of the other comments , and was not let down . Unlike some other cheap and failed movies , however , this one does n't really remain hilariously ( and unintentionally ) funny throughout.-SPOILERS FOLLOW-First of all , plot it very inconsistent . Looking past the "" small "" mistakes , such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours , the whole idea it 's based on is messed up . See , the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs . After explaining this , they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out . Later , the obligatory "" crazy scientist "" guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs . So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were , or we just have a fine little plot hole here . The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force "" half as strong "" as what was used for Hiroshima . Then two guys later walk in to check everything out , and it 's almost unscathed ! There 's even another dragon , which grew out of who knows what . All in all it 's very predictable . As soon as the guy mentioned cloning , I guessed they 'd clone a dragon . That means that our Mr. Smarty - pants security guy is n't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe , if you ignore that I knew this film would be about , you know , dragons.Putting that aside , the second worst thing is the "" special effects . "" Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning , the CG helicopter , and the dragon . It looks a bit better than a blob , but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time . To their credit , the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away ( although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie . ) These things are funny to watch , however . The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not . Nor are the "" introduction "" screens with the vital stats.Coming to the actors , they were n't the greatest , but I guess at least they tried ? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent "" BloodRayne , "" for example , and you 've got to give them points for that . One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make - up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her . She looked like she had a bad run - in with some white - face.The script is bad and cheesy . You do n't really notice the music , but it 's actually not too bad for the most part.The bottom line is do n't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it 's bad ( like I did ) , although the only funny things are the bad CG effects . Other than that , do n't waste your time and money ."	0
I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis . When Leo , the oldest announces that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange.I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one ; nor one as likely to shout at each other . I did n't understand why the family felt that youngest could n't deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film.<br / >	1
Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar 's A Bug 's Life ; we 're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film , but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation . For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it 's in the right hands that is  A Bug 's Life is a warm reminder . We walk out of the film with an equally - warm feeling , and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high - calibre film productions.It is only Pixar 's second animated feature . The sub - group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 , with their landmark movie Toy Story . It was a movie which defied convention , re - invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence . Now , they return with their sophomore effort which , to be honest , draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.After all , it 's a film about ants . Well , all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug 's Life , but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film , as humans are the focal point in dramas , romances and so on . How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie , let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film ? Surely they jest . However , we forget that in Toy Story , a bunch of toy - box items were able to become the grandest , most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted . The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat , and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you 'll probably ever encounter.Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there is n't an unpleasant character in sight ; even the villains are riveting characters  but they 're colourful , they 're eclectic , and they 're idiosyncratic . And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term , only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug 's Life from the beginning . We shall start with our main character , and our hero . His name is Flik ( David Foley ) , and his character is rather generic to say the least . Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush , beautiful Ant Island , he is the one considered the ' black sheep ' of the clan , as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season 's harvest with his antics.The problem arises in the fact that the ants ' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper ( Kevin Spacey ) , who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants ; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone , they go insane , for lack of a better term . Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack 's hands ; however , it 's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil . The cogs and clockwork in Flik 's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame , and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony 's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.If you think about it , A Bug 's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line 's of Akira Kurosawa 's classic Seven Samurai , or the American remake The Magnificent Seven , in which a village of hapless but good - hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village - dweller goes in search for help in the big city , finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil . In A Bug 's Life , the help comes in the form of a down - and - out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar - room brawl.Much amusement comes out of these scenes , and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs . Among them are an erudite stick insect ( David Hyde Pierce ) , a side - splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi - femme fatale ladybug who 's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug ( Dennis Hopper ) . It 's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on - screen , as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on - screen , as is the entire movie collectively.As I 've said , much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another , which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines , wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie . What makes A Bug 's Life even better is that the film is n't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be , although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid - friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we 'd like . However , it 's easy to ignore this fault , and it 's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.Although A Bug 's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor , this is still a superb movie , and the start of something promising here . Pixar have proved that they 're not just a one - hit wonder , but instead a much - gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood . They raise the bar endlessly , and when someone always manages to top their standards , it 's only always by themselves . What more is there to say about A Bug 's Life other than : see it ; it 's not quite the best which we 've seen from the folks at Emeryville , California , but this beats out the lot of its year  and I 'll be damned if this is n't the best animated feature of 1998.8.5/10	1
The folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published . Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell , Jr. , and makes it his own , remaining true to Vonnegut 's depiction of a man who has lost ALL ( to and ) for Love.No weaknesses in this fine adaptation .	1
"Ridiculous - looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves . So far for the horror - elements this movie has . All the rest of MUNCHIES plays out like a really retarded comedy that 's so stupid you wo n't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes . I can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers , but adults will be left with only those supposedly "" smart "" references translating to on - screen stuff like Capt . Kirk 's log entries from STAR TREK , the most well - known scene from E.T. , a blatant statement from the filmmakers going "" Look ! We 're cashing in on GREMLINS ' success here ! "" and a cardboard cut - out of Clint Eastwood telling us ... what about his western movies exactly ? That last one was totally lost on me ... Oh yes , and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing . Do n't know where they got that idea from.Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most insufferable film to sit through , for that matter . It 's just really , really dumb . And if you manage to crack a smile while watching it , you 'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film 's finished.Good Badness ? Yes , but only if "" dumb "" , "" retarded "" & "" ridiculous "" are criteria you 're looking for . 3/10 and , well , uhm , 6/10 ."	0
Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabbé who wrote the original ' The Vanishing ' ( Spoorloos ) it does have the same overall feel , except for that Koolhoven 's style is less business - like and more lyric . The beginning is great , the middle is fine , but the sting is in the end . A surprise emotional ending . As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film , but it is done all very beautifully . Never explicit , but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . It is a shame American films ca n't be as open an honoust as this one . Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject , ' De Grot ' stays always within the boundaries of good taste . ' De Grot ' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years . When you 'll leave the cinema you 'll be moved . What can we ask more of a film ? Anyway , this film even gives more ....	1
Believe it or not , Inspector Gadget 's Last Case is what got me hooked on the whole Gadget thing.My name is Miriam and I am twelve years old , so obviously I was n't around when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career . Sure , I 'd heard of him , but I did n't really know him.While reading , note that I NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL SERIES ( I would if it came on ! ) . This is just about the only Gadget thing I 've ever watched ( even though I am now obsessed ) and I will be focusing on what I liked about it since everyone else is so negative . For all you pessimists , I 've got some cons down there , too . = P First off , for a childish sense of humor , you could deem this movie pretty funny . I thought it was , so sue me . I also thought the animation and character designs were good , and I 'm also happy there was more Gadget in it , since he 's my favorite character . ( I do NOT like Penny . ) Then there was Claw ( his voice was awful , though ) and the Madcat ; I thought they were done fairly good too . Gadget 's idiocy seemed pretty well in place , if not a bit exaggerated ( i.e. sucking his hat - hand thing 's thumb . Would make a good screen shot , though . = P ) Oh , and I liked the song that ran in the credits . Yes , I am strange.And , like all movies , there are some negatives , too.Talking cars ? What 's up with that ? You can tell this was aimed at younger boys . That would n't bother me quite so much if there was n't the fact that the cars basically saved the day . I would have much preferred if Penny and Brain had taken their place . And , apparently , Gadget loved his car more than would be called natural . A bit weird , to say the least.Oh , and the Chief was downright mean to Gadget . I mean , sheesh , yeah , he was n't always the most cheerful of people , but he did n't HATE Gadget , from what I 've read . Like the Inspector , his personality was exaggerated.Well , that 's pretty much all I have to say about this movie . I thought the animation made up for the car - centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent ; more so than the live - action Gadget films ( butchered , butchered , BUTCHERED ! ) at least . Maybe I 'm just biased because this is what got me into Gadget in the first place , or maybe my mind is twisted , or maybe I 'm just odd , but I really liked this movie , even if I 'm the oldest it 's recommended for .	1
I do n't think I 'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin . ' Die Hard 2 ' was cool , and he gave the world ' Cliffhanger ' , one of the most awesome action movies ever . That 's right , you little punks , ' Cliffhanger ' rules , and we all know it.Sly plays Gabe Walker , a former rescue climber who is ' just visiting ' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend , Hal Tucker ( Michael Rooker ) , assist in a rescue on a mountain peak . Walker obviously came back at a convenient time , because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen ( John Lithgow ) . Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back ... Essentially , ' Cliffhanger ' is another ' Die Hard ' clone . Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains , complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal . Naturally , that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough , as Stallone 's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease , and slams face - first into several rock faces with no apparent side - effects . After all , is n't that what action movies are all about?'Cliffhanger ' is one of the most exciting action movies around . A showcase of great scenes and stunts . One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I 've ever seen in a movie , and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning , it maintains its action awesomeness . John Lithgow 's lead villain is entertaining , and one bad dude . Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'Cliffhanger ' is easily one of Stallone 's best efforts , definitely Renny Harlin 's best effort , and a very exciting action movie - 9/10	1
This movie pretty much sucked . I 'm in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible . If your in the Military and you see this movie you 'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad . It was ridiculous . They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do . It was a pretty gory movie I 'd have to say the least . There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump . I 'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent , gory movie . It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military . I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one .	0
"I 'm still trying to decide if this is indeed , the worst film I have ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed , but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many BSers who populate this film . The BS to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one - at the end , the interviewees seem to be saying , "" We want you to _ think _ ! ! "" , but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact.If you feel that you are open - minded , and wish to expand your consciousness , please be open - minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory : "" Einstein 's Universe "" , Nigel Calder ( a slim volume , not a challenge ) , "" The Cosmic Code "" , by Heinz Pagels . If you ca n't bring yourself to read a book , please do n't complain to reviewers about being "" open - minded"".To recap , this film is just unbelievably bad.You know what 's a really good film which questions the nature of reality ? "" Thirteenth Floor "" , directed by Roland Emmerich , with Craig Bierko , Gretchen Mol , Vincent D'onofrio . Smart , sexy , thought - provoking ."	0
"The plot does n't offer any new excitements , it even starts the same as cube I. This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery , except for having an extra exit , which is not guarded , very ingenious . The characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode , they just became "" flat "" as in a soap opera . < br />If somebody makes it to the normal exit , the person would be asked some questions , like "" do you believe in god ? "" , its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it does n't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps . Really there is nothing much else to say about it ."	0
"YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made . I saw it at a midnight screening in L.A. and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it ca nt get any stranger and THEN IT DOES ! The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an ill - fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes , there is a mute boy ( who sorta kinda looks like a girl ) and he 's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents ( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ? ? ) . Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti ( once he thaws - which takes FOREVER ) -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "" bedroom eyes "" at her - it 's like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie . In fact , once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti 's nipple and yes , the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD ! ! ! ! Yikes of all YIKES ! Plus there 's a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie - there 's also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girl 's hair "" Gee , thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout . You 're the best . "" This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up . If you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out ."	1
This is a film where the actors are all fine , especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino , in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion . In other words , it feels like they are contrived movie scenes , not like real life . Even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers , it just does n't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film . Also , when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film , it feels artificial , the way they look at each other seconds after arguing . Again , the actors are all good , and moments of this film are nice , but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling .	0
"This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick . The video is dark and poorly lit . The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed . The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun ! [ filled of course with silver bullets ] . The acting is as wooden as the characters . The FX are non - existent , lots of extreme close - ups of werewolf jaws and biting . the only thing that is shown is lots of soft - core T&A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic : "" Dog Soldiers "" with Sean Pertwee ."	0
"A sequel to ( actually a remake of ) Disney 's 1996 live - action remake of 101 Dalmations . Cruella deVil ( Glenn Close ) is released from prison after being "" cured "" of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov ( ugh ! ) . But the "" cure "" is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben , and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.This movie is bad on so many levels , starting with the fact that it 's a "" Thanksgiving family schlock "" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine . Glenn Close over - over - over - over - acts as Cruella . With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script , the endless makeup , getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely - large paycheck.(Speaking of which , where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory , a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line , and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film ? ) Of course , the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs . They serve as the "" Macaulay Culkin 's "" of this movie , pulling all the stupid "" Home Alone "" gags on the villains . ( Biting them in the crotch , running over their hands with luggage carts , squirting them with icing , etc . , etc . , etc . , ad nauseum . ) I have to admit , the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked - out French furrier . The two human "" dog lovers "" -- rehashed from the earlier film , but with different actors -- are completely boring . When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant , the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers , and their dogs at home , watching the dinner scene from "" Lady and the Tramp . "" I thought to myself , "" Oh please , do n't go there ! "" I half - expected the humans to do a satire on the "" Lady and the Tramp "" dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in "" Hot Shots : Part Deux "" -- doing the "" spaghetti strand kiss , "" pushing the meatball with his nose , etc.And do n't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle 's voice.The costumes were nominated for an Oscar , and the costumes in the movie * are * good . But they are the only good thing in the movie . The rest of it is unbearable dreck ."	0
Awesomely improbable and foolish potboiler that at least has some redeeming , crisp location photography , but it 's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension . I was kinda hoping that Stanwyck would n't make it back in time because , really , she was saddled with the wet , in more ways than one , husband , and she had an idiot child as well .. why NOT run off with Meeker ? But the nagging question remains .. what sort of wood was that pier support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off did n't float ? Stanwyck , always impeccably professional , does the best she could with the material but it 's threadbare .	0
This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits . When I got Agent Under Fire , I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better , but now there is a new type of James Bond game . This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions , the graphics of the game are out of this house . It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond , William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo , and Judi Dench as M ( forgive me all if I spell it wrong ) . This game would be own as the greatest James Bond game around.I give this a 10/10	1
I read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to Cape Fear . I completely disagree . I 'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there . I thought the casting was perfect . I thought this was one of Ed Harris 's best performances . What an evil psychopath ! ! ! I have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie . I was riveted throughout this movie . If you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see . I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie . This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it !	1
this film is really bad ....... no i mean really really bad . Tony Scott is a terrible director . out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state , besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time . what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly ( director of Donnie Darko ) did the screenplay to this . now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.now i love Mickey Rourke 's new roles but i ca nt even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it . do n't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence 's in his time and this is one of them . i do n't know what to say about Keira knightly , i think she 's a little too overrated . i just ca nt feel for her in films.all in all this film is bad . that s it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton	0
American Pie has gone a long distance from the first . At first i believe the actors do n't have a clue what their doing and instead it 's just a remake of a college party gone nuts . Story sets out as two freshman college guys ( featuring the young stifler ) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties , sex and of course the booze . The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie . In fact they did n't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free . But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking . I 'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would 've been a better choice instead .	0
"This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening . Well actually I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama and it gets a mention in both so I figured "" what the heck "" . The film brings home a few "" what if 's "" that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted . Interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor ! Nice that Those responsible did n't over load the film with unnecessary special effects , ray guns , etc . Some nice looking ' furniture ' once you figure out what that means . Remember , "" Tuesday is Soylent Green Day """	1
DOC SAVAGE : THE MAN OF BRONZE ( 1 outta 5 stars)Dreadful , dreadful movie ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super - heroic adventure hero in the ' 30s and his five assistants , all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil . It was a pretty hokey series ... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager . I knew they made a movie version in the ' 70s , starring Ron ( Tarzan ) Ely ... but I never got a chance to see it . It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV . Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why . The plot and characters are never treated seriously ... it 's all kind of tongue - in - cheek and campy ... kind of like the old Batman TV series ... only without the benefit of being funny ... or having any visual flair . Corny dialogue , cheesy special effects , dumb stereotypes , crummy action scenes and bad , bad acting . Actually , I find it kind of fascinating in its badness ... what could they have possibly been thinking ? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern - day remake ... but I do n't imagine that would have turned out to be much better .	0
"As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves , we perhaps should n't expect too much from Broken in disc form . And yet what 's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation.With regards to the latter , the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non - anamorphic transfer . Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected . Indeed , given Ferrari 's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.The same is also true of the soundtrack . Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I 'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the "" original "" , the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior . Indeed , though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you 'll notice numerous commentaries , loads of featurettes and various galleries . Indeed , given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discuss . The ' Anatomy of a Stunt ' featurette , for example , is exactly what it claims to be , and the same goes for the rest of pieces . As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken 's pre - production , production and post - production . And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall ' making of ' , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.Of the various pieces , then , it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion . Then again , there 's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks . The one involving the actors is overly jokey and does n't take the film too seriously . Ferrari 's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . And the technical ones are , well , extremely technical . Of course , we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the discs , but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome . Indeed , all in all , a fine extras package ."	1
